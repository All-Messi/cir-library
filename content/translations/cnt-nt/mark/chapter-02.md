## Mark Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Several days later, Jesus went back to Capernaum, and people heard he was home. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So many people gathered, there wasn’t room at the door, and he was speaking the message to them. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Four men came<sup>p</sup>, carrying a paralyzed man. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>With the crowd in the way, they couldn’t get to Jesus; so they took the roof apart above him and lowered the stretcher with the man on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Jesus saw their faith, he told<sup>p</sup> the man, <em>“Son, </em><em>I’m forgiving your sins</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Some scribes sitting there wondered to themselves, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Why’s</em><em> </em><em>he</em><em> talking like that</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>He’s blaspheming.</em><em> </em><em>Who can forgive sins but God?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus knew what they were thinking, <em>“Why</em><em> are you wondering about that</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Which</em><em> is easier:</em><em> to say to a pa</em><em>ralyzed man, ‘I’m forgiving your sins’;</em><em> or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your stretcher, and walk’?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Just</em><em> so</em><em> you know that the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> has the right on earth to forgive sins”</em>—he said to the man, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Get</em><em> up, pick up your stretcher, and go </em><em>on </em><em>home.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>He got up at once, picked <em>it</em> up, and went out in front of everybody. They were astounded and praised God, <em>“We’ve never seen anything like this.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Jesus went out again beside the lake. The whole crowd went along, and he started teaching <em>again</em>.</span>

### 1-13 Calling Matthew; Controversy About Eating with Sinners


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>As he passed along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Come with me.</em><em>”</em> He got up and went with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>He was reclining<sup>p</sup> at table in <em>Levi’s</em> house. Many tax collectors and sinners were reclining at table with him and his disciples because many of them were following him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When the scribes of the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they started saying to his disciples, <em>“Why’s he eating with tax collectors and sinners?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus overheard it, <em>“Healthy people don’t need a doctor</em><em>; </em><em>sick</em><em> ones do</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I didn’t come </em><em>so</em> <em>much </em><em>to call good people </em><em>as</em><em> </em>to call <em>sinners.”</em> <strong>Question About Fasting</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The disciples of John and the Pharisees were accustomed to fasting. They came<sup>p</sup> and asked<sup>p</sup> Jesus, <em>“Why do John’s and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but yours don’t?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Groo</em><em>msmen can’t feel like fasting while</em><em> the groom’s </em><em>around,</em><em> </em><em>can they</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> time</em><em>’s coming</em><em> when the groom will be taken </em><em>away </em><em>from them.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll fast</em><em> then</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>“Nobody</em><em> sews a patch of un</em><em>shrunk cloth on an </em><em>old </em><em>garment</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The new patch would pull away from the old material and make the tear worse.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Nobody</em><em> puts new wine in old wineskins.</em><em> </em><em>It would </em><em>burst</em><em> the wineskins, and the wine would be los</em><em>t </em><em>and</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>he wineskins</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>People put new wine in new wineskins.” </em><em>	</em></span>

### Controversy About Breaking Sabbath


<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>On a Sabbath he was going along grain fields, and his disciples started picking off heads as they went along.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>The Pharisees said, <em>“Why are they doing what’s against the L</em><em>aw</em><em> </em><em>on Sabbath</em><em>?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>He said, <em>“</em><em>You have</em><em> read</em><em>, haven’t you,</em><em> </em><em>what David did when he and his men</em><em> </em><em>needed something to eat</em><em>? </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>H</em><em>e</em><em> went in</em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>God’s</em><em> house at the time of Abiathar the high priest</em><em> and ate the consecrated bread that’s against the L</em><em>aw for anybody but priests to eat</em><em>. He </em><em>gave some to the ones with</em><em> him. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Sabbath</em><em> was made for </em><em>people</em><em>,</em><em> not people for Sabbath</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>P</em><em>erson</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>takes precedence over </em><em>Sabbath</em><em>”</em><sup>lit</sup>.<strong>  [</strong><strong>or lit., “</strong><strong>The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath</strong><strong>.”</strong><strong>]</strong></span>
