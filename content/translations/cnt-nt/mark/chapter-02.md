## Mark Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Several days later, Jesus went back to Capernaum, and people heard he was home. 2So many people gathered, there wasn't room at the door, and he was speaking the message to them. 3Four men camep, carrying a paralyzed man. 4With the crowd in the way, they couldn't get to Jesus; so they took the roof apart above him and lowered the stretcher with the man on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When Jesus saw their faith, he toldp the man, "Son, I'm forgiving your sins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Some scribes sitting there wondered to themselves, 7"Why's he talking like that? He's blaspheming. Who can forgive sins but God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus knew what they were thinking, "Why are you wondering about that? 9Which is easier: to say to a paralyzed man, 'I'm forgiving your sins'; or to say, 'Get up, pick up your stretcher, and walk'? 10Just so you know that the Son of Man has the right on earth to forgive sins"—he said to the man, 11"Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go on home."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He got up at once, picked it up, and went out in front of everybody. They were astounded and praised God, "We've never seen anything like this." 13Jesus went out again beside the lake. The whole crowd went along, and he started teaching again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> As he passed along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. He saidp, "Come with me." He got up and went with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He was recliningp at table in Levi's house. Many tax collectors and sinners were reclining at table with him and his disciples because many of them were following him. 16When the scribes of the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they started saying to his disciples, "Why's he eating with tax collectors and sinners?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jesus overheard it, "Healthy people don't need a doctor; sick ones do. I didn't come so much to call good people as to call sinners."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The disciples of John and the Pharisees were accustomed to fasting. They camep and askedp Jesus, "Why do John's and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but yours don't?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He said, "Groomsmen can't feel like fasting while the groom's around, can they? 20The time's coming when the groom will be taken away from them. They'll fast then." 21"Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. The new patch would pull away from the old material and make the tear worse. 22Nobody puts new wine in old wineskins. It would burst the wineskins, and the wine would be lost and the wineskins. People put new wine in new wineskins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> On a Sabbath he was going along grain fields, and his disciples started picking off heads as they went along.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The Pharisees said, "Why are they doing what's against the Law on Sabbath?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He said, "You have read, haven't you, what David did when he and his men needed something to eat? 26He went into God's house at the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread that's against the Law for anybody but priests to eat. He gave some to the ones with him. 27Sabbath was made for people, not people for Sabbath. 28Person takes precedence over Sabbath"lit.  [or lit., "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."]</span>
