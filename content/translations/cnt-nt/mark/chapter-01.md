<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <strong><em>one</em></strong><strong><em> shouting in the desert,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>‘G</em></strong><strong><em>et the </em></strong><strong><em>road ready for the L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>!</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	M</em></strong><strong><em>ake </em></strong><strong><em>it straight’</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> [</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 40:3]</strong>!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> John came baptizing in the desert and preaching a baptism of repentance to forgive sins. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The people from<strong> </strong>Jerusalem and Judaea were going out to have him baptize them in the Jordan <em>River</em>, as they confessed their sins. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>John wore camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist and lived on locusts and wild honey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Spirit took<sup>p</sup> him directly into the desert, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and the devil tempted him there for 40 days. He was with the wild animals, and angels were helping him.</span>

### Introductory Statements  	About the Galilean Ministry


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, delivering God’s good news: <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“It’s</em><em> time; God’s kingdom i</em><em>s </em><em>on its way</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Repent and believe the good news.”</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 1:14-15</p>

### Calling 4 Fishermen


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> As he passed along Lake Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting nets in the lake; they were fishermen. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“Come with me</em><em>;</em><em> I’ll have you ‘fishing’ for people.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They left their nets and went with him. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>A little farther along, he saw Zebedee’s sons, James and John, in a boat, mending nets. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He called them, and they left their father in the boat with the hired help and went with him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 1:16-20</p>

### Teaching and Miracles in Capernaum


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They went<sup>p</sup> to Capernaum and entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and he started teaching. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The people were amazed at how he taught; he was teaching them like someone that had authority, not like the scribes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> A man in their synagogue had an unclean spirit that shouted,<strong> </strong><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em> is this</em><em>, Jesus, you Nazarene?</em><em> </em><em>Did you come to destroy us?</em><em> </em><em>I know who you are:</em><em> God’s Holy One!</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Jesus rebuked it, <em>“Be quiet</em><em> and</em><em> come out of him</em><em>!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, made a loud noise, and came out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They were surprised and started, wondering to each other, “<em>What </em>is<em> this?</em><em> A n</em><em>ew </em>kind of<em> </em><em>teaching</em><em> with authority</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>He even </em><em>gives </em><em>orders</em><em> to</em><em> unclean spirits, and they obey.”</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>The news about him spread all over that part of Galilee.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They left the synagogue and went to Simon and Andrew’s house with James and John. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Peter’s mother-in-law was in bed sick with a fever, and they told him about her. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He went and took her hand and raised her up. The fever went away, and she started waiting on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That evening at sunset, people were bringing him the sick and demon-possessed. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The whole town gathered at the door. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He healed them from many kinds of diseases and cast out lots of demons. He wouldn’t let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 1:21-34</p>

### The First General Tour of Galilee


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> In the morning, a good while before daylight, Jesus got up and went out by himself to pray. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Simon and the others hunted for him <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>till they found him; <em>“Everybody’s looking for you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Let’s go to the </em><em>villages nearby so I can preach there. T</em><em>hat’s </em><em>the </em>main<em> reason</em><em> I came.”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>He went around preaching in their synagogues all over Galilee and casting out demons.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 1:35-39</p>

### Cleansing a Leper


<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> A leper came<sup>p</sup> and pleaded with him on his knees, <em>“If you’re willing, you can cleanse me.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He felt sorry for him and reached out and touched him, <em>“I’m willing; be cleansed.”</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>Instantly his leprosy disappeared. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>Jesus spoke strictly to him and sent him off at once, <strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Keep</em><em> this to yourself, s</em><em>how yourself to </em><em>a</em><em> priest</em><em>,</em><em> and offer for your purification</em><em> </em><em>what Moses commanded </em><em>for</em><em> a</em><em> public testimony</em><em>.</em><strong><em><sup>”</sup></em></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But he went out and spread it around, so Jesus had a hard time going into a town openly anymore. He stayed out in open areas, and people were coming to him from everywhere.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
