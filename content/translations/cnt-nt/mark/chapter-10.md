<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>From there he went<sup>p</sup> to places in Judaea and beyond the Jordan. Again, crowds went<sup>p</sup> with him; and he was teaching them like usual.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Pharisees came and asked if a man could legally divorce his wife—testing him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He answered, <em>“What did Moses command you?”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Moses</em><em> allowed a husband </em><strong><em>to write a certifi</em></strong><strong><em>cate of divorce and divorce her</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 24:1</strong>,<strong> 3]</strong><strong>.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“He wrote that because </em><em>of your</em><em> hardhearted</em><em>ness</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>From</em><em> the beginning of creation, </em><strong><em>‘he made them male and female</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 5:2]</strong><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><em>So</em></strong><strong><em> a man is to leave his </em></strong><strong><em>parents </em></strong><strong><em>and </em></strong><strong><em>be unite with</em></strong><strong><em> his wife, </em></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><em>and</em></strong><strong><em> they’</em></strong><strong><em>ll become a physical unit’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 2:24]</strong><em>;</em><em> </em><em>they’re no longer two but one.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> God has joined</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>people</em><em> </em><em>are</em><em> not to separate.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>In the house the disciples asked him about it again. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Whoever</em><em> divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> </em><em>a woman</em><em> divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</em><em>	</em></span>

### Jesus and the Little Children


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>People were bringing their kids so he could touch them, but the disciples fussed at them. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When Jesus saw it, he was indignant, <em>“Let the</em><em>m come to me. Don’t get in their way. God’s kingdom </em><em>is made up of people like them.</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> doesn’t welcome </em><em>God’s kingdom </em><em>like a little </em><em>child,</em><em> </em><em>will certainly not </em><em>get in</em><em>to</em><em> it.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He took the children in his arms and laid hands on them.</span>

### The Rich Young Ruler


<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>As he was going out to the road, a man ran and knelt to him, <em>“Good Rabbi, what can I do to inherit eternal life?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“Why are you calling me good?</em><em> Only </em><em>God</em><em> is </em><em>good.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> know the commandments, </em><strong><em>‘do no</em></strong><strong><em>t murder, commit adultery, steal, lie,</em></strong><strong><em> or swindle</em></strong><strong><em>; respect </em></strong><strong><em>your parents</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 20:12-16;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>That surprised the disciples, but he said<sup>p</sup> it again; <em>“Children, it’s so hard to get into </em><em>God’s kingdom</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>It’s</em><em> easier for a camel to go through </em><em>a needle’s eye </em><em>than for </em><em>rich people</em><em> t</em><em>o get into</em><em> </em><em>God’s kingdom</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>They were surprised even more and said to one another, <em>“So who can be saved?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus looked at them and said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“It’s not </em><em>possible with</em><em> people, but with God e</em><em>verything’s possible.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Peter spoke up, <em>“We’ve left everything to follow you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Jesus said, <em>“Everybody that’</em><em>s left a house, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or fields for my sake </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>will</em><em> receive houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields</em><em> 100 times over </em><em>in this </em><em>age</em><em> with persecution and</em><em> </em><em>eternal life in the age to come.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>Many</em><em> first will be last and last, first.”</em><strong>     </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### Another Prediction of His Death


<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>On the way up to Jerusalem, Jesus was ahead of them. They were wondering what was going to happen, and the people behind were afraid. He called the Twelve again and explained to them what was about to happen: <strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>“We’re</em><em> going to Jerusalem, and </em><em>I’ll</em><em> be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll condemn </em><em>me</em><em> to death and turn </em><em>me</em><em> over to the Gentiles.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> make fun of </em><em>me</em><em>, spit on </em><em>me</em><em>, flog </em><em>me</em><em>, and put </em><em>me</em><em> to death.</em><em> </em><em>Three days later </em><em>I</em><em>’ll resurrect.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong></span>

### James and John’s Request for Rank


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>James and John, Zebedee’s sons, came<sup>p</sup>, saying, <em>“Rabbi, we want you to do something.”</em> <strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em> is it?”</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>“Let</em><em> us sit on your right and left hand in your glory.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>Jesus told them, <em>“You don’t </em><em>know</em><em> what you’re asking.</em><em> Can you drink the cup I drink and</em><em> be baptized with the baptism I’m baptized with?”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>“Yes</em><em>.”</em> Jesus said, <em>“You’ll drink the cup I drink </em>all right <em>and be baptized with the baptism I’m baptized with.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>But I’m not the One that</em><em> de</em><em>cid</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em> who sits on</em><em> my right and left hand. They’re</em><em> the ones </em>it’s<em> prepared</em><em> </em><em>for.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>41</sup></strong>When the ten heard it, they were indignant over what James and John had done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“You know that rulers among</em><em> the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants toward them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>It’s</em><em> not that way with you.</em><em> </em><em>Whoever wants to be great among you will be your </em><em>servant</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> whoever wants to be first among you will be the </em><em>servant</em><em> of all.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>Even</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em> didn’t come to be served, but to serve, and to give </em><em>my</em><em> life as a ransom for many.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

As he, his disciples, and a sizeable crowd were leaving the city, Bartimaeus (<em>“</em><em>Son of Timaeus”</em>), a beggar, was sitting by the road. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>When he heard it was Jesus the Nazarene, he started yelling, <em>“Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>People told him to quiet down, but he yelled louder, <em>“Son of David, have mercy on me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jesus stopped, <em>“Call him</em><em> </em>over here<em>.”</em> They called him, <em>“</em><em>O</em><em>kay; get up; he’s calling </em><em>for </em><em>you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He threw his cloak aside, jumped up, and went to Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus answered him, <em>“What do you want me to do for you?”</em> <em>“Rabbi, I want to see</em><em> again</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>52</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> on</em><em>, your faith has made you able to see.”</em> Instantly he could see again, and he went with Jesus on the road.</span>
