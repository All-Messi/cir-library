<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> In the house the disciples asked him about it again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>“Whoever</em><em> divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> </em><em>a woman</em><em> divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> As he was going out to the road, a man ran and knelt to him, <em>“Good Rabbi, what can I do to inherit eternal life?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jesus said, <em>“Why are you calling me good?</em><em> Only </em><em>God</em><em> is </em><em>good.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> know the commandments, </em><strong><em>‘do no</em></strong><strong><em>t murder, commit adultery, steal, lie,</em></strong><strong><em> or swindle</em></strong><strong><em>; respect </em></strong><strong><em>your parents</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20;</strong> <strong>24:14</strong><strong>]</strong>.</span>
