## Mark Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When they got<sup>p</sup> close to Jerusalem—to Bethphage and Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, he sent<sup>p</sup> two disciples,<strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> in the village </em><em>over there</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Just inside, you’ll find a donkey colt tied that nobody has ridden.</em><em> </em><em>Untie it and bring it here.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> anybody says, ‘Why are you </em><em>doing this</em><em>?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it,’ and he’ll </em><em>send</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> it here right away.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They went and found the colt tied at the gate outside by the road and untied<sup>p</sup> it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Some of the ones standing there said, <em>“What’re you doing, untying the colt?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The disciples said what Jesus told them to say, and they let them take it. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They brought<sup>p</sup> it to Jesus and put<sup>p</sup> their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>People spread their cloaks on the road and brought leafy branches they’d cut out of the fields. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The ones in front and behind started shouting, <strong><em>“Hosanna!</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>B</em></strong><strong><em>lessed </em></strong><strong><em>be</em></strong><strong><em> the one that’s</em></strong><strong><em> coming in the name of the L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:25-26]</strong><strong>!</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup><em>	</em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>B</em><em>lessed</em><em> is the coming kingdom of our </em><em>ancestor David.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>Hosanna</em></strong><em> in the highest!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>He entered the Temple in Jerusalem and looked around at everything. It was already evening, and he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</span>

### Cursing the Fig Tree;  Second Cleansing of the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The next day, when they left Bethany, he was hungry. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>From a distance he saw a fig tree leafed out and went to see if he’d find anything on it. He didn’t find anything but leaves—it wasn’t the season for figs yet. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He said to it, <em>“May nobody ever eat fruit from you again.”</em> His disciples heard it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They went<sup>p</sup> into Jerusalem. In the Temple, he started putting out the buyers and sellers. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of men selling doves. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He wouldn’t let anybody carry a container through the Temple. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He began to teach, <em>“</em><em>Doesn’t scripture say</em><em>, </em> <strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Call my house a house of</em></strong><strong><em> prayer for all the nations’</em></strong><em>?</em><em> </em><strong>[</span>

### ]  You’ve made it ‘a den of thieves’!” [Jer 7:11]


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The chief priests and scribes heard about it and kept looking for a way to destroy him. They were afraid of him, and the crowd was astonished at his teaching. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>In the evening, he<em> and his disciples </em>left the city.</span>

### Discussing the Shriveled Fig Tree


<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>As they went by early the next morning, they saw the fig tree completely shriveled up. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Peter remembered, <em>“Rabbi, the fig t</em><em>ree you cursed has shriveled up!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Trust</em><em> God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> says to this mountain, ‘Be picked up and thrown in</em><em>to</em><em> the sea,’ and doesn’t doubt, </em><em>it’ll happen</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> many things as </em><em>you </em><em>ask</em><em> for</em><em> in prayer,</em><em> believe you’</em><em>ve as good as received </em><em>it</em><em><sup>aorist</sup></em><em>, and </em><em>you will</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> you stand praying, if you have anything against anybody, forgive</em><em> him</em><em> so your Father in heaven will forgive you.”</em><em> </em>[<strong><sup>26</sup></strong>]<sup>ms</sup></span>

### Jesus’ Authority Challenged


<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They went<sup>p</sup> into Jerusalem again. While he was walking in the Temple, the Pharisees, scribes, and elders came<sup>p</sup>, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“Wha</em><em>t</em><em> right do</em><em> you have to do th</em><em>is? Who gave you that</em><em> right?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“I’ll ask you </em><em>some</em><em>thing.</em><em> </em><em>Answer me and</em><em> I’ll tell you what right I have</em><em> to do </em><em>this</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>Was</em><em> John’s baptis</em><em>m from heaven or humans? Answer</em><em> that.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>They consulted with one another, <em>“If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he’ll say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?</em>’ <strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> </em><em>if we say, ‘From humans’</em><em>”—</em>they were afraid of the crowd because they all certainly considered John a prophet. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>They answered<sup>p</sup>,<em> “We don’t know.”</em><em> </em> Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“I won’t tell you either what right I h</em><em>ave</em><em> to do th</em><em>is</em><em>.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
