## Mark Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When they gotp close to Jerusalem—to Bethphage and Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, he sentp two disciples, 2"Go in the village over there. Just inside, you'll find a donkey colt tied that nobody has ridden. Untie it and bring it here. 3If anybody says, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it,' and he'll sendp it here right away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They went and found the colt tied at the gate outside by the road and untiedp it. 5Some of the ones standing there said, "What're you doing, untying the colt?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The disciples said what Jesus told them to say, and they let them take it. 7They broughtp it to Jesus and putp their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. 8People spread their cloaks on the road and brought leafy branches they'd cut out of the fields. 9The ones in front and behind started shouting,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He entered the Temple in Jerusalem and looked around at everything. It was already evening, and he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The next day, when they left Bethany, he was hungry. 13From a distance he saw a fig tree leafed out and went to see if he'd find anything on it. He didn't find anything but leaves—it wasn't the season for figs yet. 14He said to it, "May nobody ever eat fruit from you again." His disciples heard it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They wentp into Jerusalem. In the Temple, he started putting out the buyers and sellers. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of men selling doves. 16He wouldn't let anybody carry a container through the Temple. 17He began to teach, "Doesn't scripture say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The chief priests and scribes heard about it and kept looking for a way to destroy him. They were afraid of him, and the crowd was astonished at his teaching. 19In the evening, he and his disciples left the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> As they went by early the next morning, they saw the fig tree completely shriveled up. 21Peter remembered, "Rabbi, the fig tree you cursed has shriveled up!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Jesus saidp, "Trust God. 23Whoever says to this mountain, 'Be picked up and thrown into the sea,' and doesn't doubt, it'll happen. 24As many things as you ask for in prayer, believe you've as good as received itaorist, and you will. 25When you stand praying, if you have anything against anybody, forgive him so your Father in heaven will forgive you." [26]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They wentp into Jerusalem again. While he was walking in the Temple, the Pharisees, scribes, and elders camep, 28"What right do you have to do this? Who gave you that right?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jesus said, "I'll ask you something. Answer me and I'll tell you what right I have to do this. 30Was John's baptism from heaven or humans? Answer that."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They consulted with one another, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he'll say, 'Why didn't you believe him?' 32But if we say, 'From humans'"—they were afraid of the crowd because they all certainly considered John a prophet. 33They answeredp, "We don't know."</span>
