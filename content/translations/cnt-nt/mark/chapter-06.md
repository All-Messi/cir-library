## Mark Chapter 6

### Last Visit to Nazareth

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup> </sup></strong>He left for his hometown with his disciples. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When Sabbath came, he taught in the synagogue, and many were astonished when they heard<sup>p</sup> <em>him</em>: <em>“Where’d he get that</em><em> wisdom and </em><em>those</em><em> miracles </em><em>he does</em><em> </em><em>with</em><em> his hands?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Isn’t</em><em> this the </em><em>builder</em><em>, Mary</em><em>’s son</em><em> and brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon?</em><em> </em><em>Aren’t his sisters here?”</em> They were put off by him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus told them, <em>“A prophet i</em><em>s </em><em>respected everywhere except in his home</em><em>town, among his relatives, in his own </em><em>family</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He couldn’t do any miracle there—except he did lay hands on a few sick people and healed them. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He was amazed at their disbelief. He continued to move around the villages and teach.</span>

### Mission of the Twelve


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He called<sup>p</sup> the Twelve aside and got them ready to go out in pairs with authority over unclean spirits. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He instructed them not to take anything except a rod—no bread, traveler’s bag or money in their belt, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>but to wear sandals. <em>“Don’t </em><em>take</em><em> two </em><em>shirt</em><em>s</em><em> to wear</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Stay</em><em> </em><em>at</em><em> whatever ho</em><em>us</em><em>e you </em><em>enter</em><em> till you leave the area.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> a</em><em> place doesn’t </em><em>welcome</em><em> you or listen to you, leave </em><em>and shake</em><em> the dust off your feet as a statement to them.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They went out and preached that people should repent. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They cast out demons and anointed many sick people and healed them.</span>

### Herod’s Stricken Conscience


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> King Herod heard about <em>him</em> because Jesus had become well known. People were saying John the Baptist had arisen from the dead and that was why miraculous powers were working in him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Others were saying he was Elijah or like one of the prophets. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When Herod heard about it, he said, <em>“John that I beheaded has resurrected.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because he’d married her. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>John kept telling Herod, <em>“It’s against the L</em><em>aw for you to be living with your brother’s wife.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to have him killed; but she couldn’t <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>because Herod was afraid of him. He knew he was upright and holy, and he protected him. He listened to him many times and was confused, but he liked to listen to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> A chance came when Herod threw a banquet on his birthday for his officials, military commanders, and prominent men of Galilee. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When his daughter of Herodias came in and danced, it pleased Herod and the ones reclining at table with him. The king said to the girl <em>“Ask me for whatever you want, and I’ll give it to you.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He strongly swore to her, <em>“I’ll give you whatever you ask for up to half my kingdom.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> She went out and asked her mother what she should<em> </em>ask for. <em>“The head of John the Baptist</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> She hurried back and asked, <em>“I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Herod became deeply grieved; but because of his oaths and the guests, he wasn’t willing to refuse her. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He sent the executioner to bring John’s head. He went and beheaded him in prison, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>When his disciples heard about it, they came and got his corpse and put it in a tomb.</span>

### Feeding the 5,000


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The apostles came back<sup>p</sup> to Jesus and reported what all they’d done and taught. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Come off by yourselves away from the crowds and rest awhile.”</em> So many people were coming and going they didn’t have time to eat. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They left in a boat to a place off by themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> People saw them leaving and figured out where they were going. They ran as a group from the towns and got there first. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>When he got out <em>of </em><em>the boat</em>, he saw a large crowd and felt sorry for them: they were like sheep without a shepherd. He began to teach them a lot of things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> When it was getting quite late, his disciples came to him, <em>“Nobody lives around here</em><em>,</em><em> and it’s getting late.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Dismiss</em><em> them </em><em>so they can</em><em> go into the countryside and villages to buy food.</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> But he answered, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> </em><em>feed them</em><em>.”</em> <em>“Should we go</em><em> spend </em><em>200</em><em> denarii on bread to feed them</em><em>!</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> <em>“</em><em>Go</em><em> </em><em>see </em><em>how many loaves you have</em><em>.”</em> They found five, and two fish<em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He told <em>his disciples</em> to have everybody sit down on the green grass <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>in groups of 50 and 100. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He took the five loaves and two fish, and looked up at the sky, blessed and broke the loaves, and started giving <em>them</em> to his disciples to distribute to the crowd, and divided up the two fish for everybody. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>They all ate till they were full. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> disciples </em>picked up twelve baskets of bread and fish pieces. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>5,000 men had eaten the loaves.</span>

### Jesus Walking on the Water


<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Jesus urged his disciples to get in the boat right away and go on to Bethsaida, on the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>When he’d said goodbye to everybody, he went up on the hill to pray. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>In the evening the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>He saw them straining at the oars because the wind was against them. About 4 in the morning, he went to them walking on the water as if he intended to go on by. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>When they saw him walking on the water, they thought he was a ghost and cried out terrified. <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>At once he spoke<sup>p</sup>, <em>“It’s me.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t </em><em>let me scare you</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong>He climbed up into the boat with them and the wind died down. They were astounded. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>They hadn’t got the point about the loaves. They weren’t catching on.</span>
