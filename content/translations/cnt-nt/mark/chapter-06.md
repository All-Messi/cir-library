## Mark Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> He left for his hometown with his disciples. 2When Sabbath came, he taught in the synagogue, and many were astonished when they heardp him: "Where'd he get that wisdom and those miracles he does with his hands? 3Isn't this the builder, Mary's son and brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here?" They were put off by him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus told them, "A prophet is respected everywhere except in his hometown, among his relatives, in his own family." 5He couldn't do any miracle there—except he did lay hands on a few sick people and healed them. 6He was amazed at their disbelief.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He calledp the Twelve aside and got them ready to go out in pairs with authority over unclean spirits. 8He instructed them not to take anything except a rod—no bread, traveler's bag or money in their belt, 9but to wear sandals. "Don't take two shirts to wear. 10Stay at whatever house you enter till you leave the area. 11If a place doesn't welcome you or listen to you, leave and shake the dust off your feet as a statement to them." 12They went out and preached that people should repent. 13They cast out demons and anointed many sick people and healed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> King Herod heard about him because Jesus had become well known. People were saying John the Baptist had arisen from the dead and that was why miraculous powers were working in him. 15Others were saying he was Elijah or like one of the prophets. 16When Herod heard about it, he said, "John that I beheaded has resurrected." 17Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he'd married her. 18John kept telling Herod, "It's against the Law for you to be living with your brother's wife." 19Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to have him killed; but she couldn't 20because Herod was afraid of him. He knew he was upright and holy, and he protected him. He listened to him many times and was confused, but he liked to listen to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> A chance came when Herod threw a banquet on his birthday for his officials, military commanders, and prominent men of Galilee. 22When his daughter of Herodias came in and danced, it pleased Herod and the ones reclining at table with him. The king said to the girl "Ask me for whatever you want, and I'll give it to you." 23He strongly swore to her, "I'll give you whatever you ask for up to half my kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> She went out and asked her mother what she should ask for.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> She hurried back and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Herod became deeply grieved; but because of his oaths and the guests, he wasn't willing to refuse her. 27He sent the executioner to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in prison, 28brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. 29When his disciples heard about it, they came and got his corpse and put it in a tomb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The apostles came backp to Jesus and reported what all they'd done and taught. 31He saidp, "Come off by yourselves away from the crowds and rest awhile." So many people were coming and going they didn't have time to eat. 32They left in a boat to a place off by themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> People saw them leaving and figured out where they were going. They ran as a group from the towns and got there first. 34When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd and felt sorry for them: they were like sheep without a shepherd. He began to teach them a lot of things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> When it was getting quite late, his disciples came to him, "Nobody lives around here, and it's getting late. 36Dismiss them so they can go into the countryside and villages to buy food."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> But he answered, "You feed them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He told his disciples to have everybody sit down on the green grass 40in groups of 50 and 100. 41He took the five loaves and two fish, and looked up at the sky, blessed and broke the loaves, and started giving them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd, and divided up the two fish for everybody. 42They all ate till they were full. 43The disciples picked up twelve baskets of bread and fish pieces. 445,000 men had eaten the loaves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Jesus urged his disciples to get in the boat right away and go on to Bethsaida, on the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. 46When he'd said goodbye to everybody, he went up on the hill to pray. 47In the evening the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. 48He saw them straining at the oars because the wind was against them. About 4 in the morning, he went to them walking on the water as if he intended to go on by. 49When they saw him walking on the water, they thought he was a ghost and cried out terrified. 50At once he spokep, "It's me. Don't let me scare you." 51He climbed up into the boat with them and the wind died down. They were astounded. 52They hadn't got the point about the loaves. They weren't catching on. 53When they'd crossed over to land, they tied up at Gennesaret. 54As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized him. 55They hurried around the vicinity and started bringing sick people on stretchers to wherever they heard he was. 56Whatever villages, towns, or countryside he'd go to, they'd put sick people in the marketplaces and appeal to him just to touch his clothes. As many as touched him were cured.</span>
