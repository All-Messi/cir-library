## Mark Chapter **14**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The Passover and Festival of Unleavened Bread was two days away.

### The Anointing of Jesus by Mary


<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster cruise of expensive pure nard ointment. She broke open the alabaster cruise and poured it on his head. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Some were expressing their indignation to one another, <em>“Why has </em><em>she wasted </em><em>this ointment?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>She</em><em> could’ve sold </em><em>it </em><em>for over </em><em>300</em><em> denarii and given</em><em> it</em><em> to the poor.”</em><em> </em>They started fussing at her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Jesus said, <em>“Leave her alone.</em><em> </em><em>Why are you bothering her?</em><em> </em><em>She’s done me a good turn.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> always have poor </em><em>people </em><em>with you; you can do </em><em>something good for </em><em>them any time.</em><em> </em><em>You </em><em>w</em><em>on’t always </em><em>have</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>She</em><em> did what she could:</em><em> </em><em>she anointed my body </em><em>ahead of time</em><em> for burial.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Wherever</em><em> </em><em>you</em><em> </em><em>deliver the good news</em><em> in the world, </em><em>tell what she’</em><em>s done in memory of her.</em><em>”</em><strong> </strong><strong>    </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### Preparation for the Passover Meal


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, his disciples said, <em>“Where do you want us to get things ready for eating the Passover?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He sent<sup>p</sup> two disciples and said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“On the way in</em><em>to</em><em> the city, </em><em>you’ll meet a man</em><em> carrying a clay pot of water.</em><em> </em><em>Follow him, </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> wher</em><em>e</em><em> he goes in, say to the </em><em>owner, ‘The Rabbi says, “</em><em>Where’s </em><em>the guest room</em><em> so I can eat </em><em>the Passover with my disciples?”</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> show you a big room upstairs</em><em>,</em><em> furnished and </em><em>set up</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Get things ready there.”</em><em> </em></span>

### The Passover Meal; Judas Identified as Traitor


<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He arrived<sup>p</sup> that evening with the Twelve. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>As they were reclining at table eating, he said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“O</em><em>ne of you that’s eating with me </em><em>is going to</em><em> betray me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They became sad and said one by one, <em>“It’s not me, is it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He said, <em>“It’s one of </em><em>t</em><em>he </em><em>Twelve</em><em> that</em><em>’s dipping</em><em> with me in the bowl.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>Son of Man will go like scripture says</em><em>, but woe to the </em><em>one</em><em> that betrays him!</em><em> </em><em>It would’ve been better for him if he</em><em> hadn’t </em><em>been born.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

### The Lord’s Supper Instituted


<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>During the meal Jesus took a loaf, blessed it, broke it, and handed it to them: <em>“Take it;</em><em> this is my body.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He took a cup, blessed it, handed it to them, and they all drank out of it. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He said, <em>“This is my blood of the covenant that’s shed for many.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is the last time I’ll drink </em><em>the fruit of the vine till I d</em><em>o</em><em> it in </em><em>God’s kingdom</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><em>But</em><em> after I resurrect</em><em>, I’ll go ahead of you </em><em>to</em><em> Galilee.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Peter said, <em>“Even if everybody else deserts you, I won’t.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“I tell you, </em><em>before </em><em>a</em><em> rooster </em><em>double-crows in the morning, you’re going to</em><em> deny</em><em> me</em><em> three times.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He kept insisting, <em>“Even if I have to die with you, I </em><em>won’t</em><em> deny you.”</em> That’s what they all said.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 14:27-31</p>

### The Agony in the Garden


<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>They came<sup>p</sup> to a place named Gethsemane, and he told<sup>p</sup> his disciples, <em>“Sit here while I pray.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He took<sup>p</sup> Peter, James, and John, and began to feel stress and dread. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>“I’m</em><em> really stressed.</em><em> </em><em>Stay here and keep watch.”</em> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>He went on a little way and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if possible, the time would pass him by. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>“Abba</em><em> (</em><em>Father</em><em>)</em><em>, you can do anything.</em><em> </em><em>Take this cup away from me.</em><em> </em><em>But not what I want</em><em>, but</em><em> what you want.”</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>He came<sup>p</sup> and found<sup>p</sup> them sleeping and said<sup>p</sup> to Simon, <em>“</em><em>Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’re</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> sleeping?</em><em> </em><em>Couldn’t you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> watch for one hour?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>Watch</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> and pray so you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> won’t be tempted.</em><em> </em><em>The spirit’s willing but the flesh is weak.”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>He went again and prayed the same thing. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>When he came back, he found them sleeping; they couldn’t keep their eyes open. They didn’t know what to say. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He came<sup>p</sup> the third time, <em>“Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’re</em><em> </em><em>still </em><em>sleeping and resting?</em><em> The</em><em> time</em><em> has come</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> is </em><em>being</em><em> betrayed </em><em>to</em><em> sinners.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>Get</em><em> up; let’s go</em><em>! </em><em>The one that’s betraying me is coming.” </em><strong>	</strong></span>

### The Arrest of Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>While he was still talking, Judas came<sup>p</sup> with a crowd from the chief priests, scribes, and elders, carrying<sup>pl</sup> swords and clubs. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The traitor had given them a signal, <em>“T</em><em>he one I kiss</em><em> is him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Arrest him and take him away safely.”</em> <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>He came right up to Jesus and said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Rabbi,”</em> and kissed him. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>They grabbed jesus and arrested him. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>One of those standing by drew his sword and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his ear. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>Jesus responded to them, <em>“Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’ve</em><em> come out </em>here <em>with swords and clubs to arrest me like an </em><em>insurgent</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> was with you every day in the </em><em>T</em><em>emple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me.</em><em> </em><em>But </em>this is happening<em> to fulfill the scriptures.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> disciples</em> ran away. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>A young man was following him with a linen sheet around his naked body. They grabbed at him, <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>but he left the sheet behind and fled naked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><sup><strong>53</strong></sup>They took Jesus to the high priest. The chief priests, elders, and scribes convened<sup>p</sup>. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>Peter followed him at a distance to the high priest’s courtyard and sat down with the officers to warm himself at the fire.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 14:43-54</p>

### The Trial Before Caiaphas


<span class="verse" id="v55"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The chief priest and the full Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus so they could put him to death, but they couldn’t find any. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>A number of people gave false testimony against him, but their testimonies didn’t agree with each other. <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>Some got up and gave false testimony, <strong><sup>58</sup></strong><em>“We</em><em> heard him say</em><em> he’d</em><em> tear down this </em><em>sanctuary made with hands</em><em> and build </em><em>another one in three days </em><em>without hands.”</em> <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>Their testimonies didn’t agree even on that point.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The high priest stood up and asked Jesus, <em>“Aren’t you going to answer anything these men are testifying against you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v61"><sup><strong>61</strong></sup>He didn’t answer. The high priest asked him again, “<em>Are you the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, the Son of the Blessed?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>62</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> am;</em> <em>	‘</em><strong><em>Y</em></strong><strong><em>ou’ll see the </em></strong><strong><em>Son of Man</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	sitting on the right hand of Power</em></strong><em> and</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>comi</em></strong><strong><em>ng with the clouds</em></strong><em>’”</em> <strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 110:1</strong><strong>;</span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 7:14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><sup><strong>63</strong></sup>The high priest tore his clothes, <em>“Why do we still need witnesses?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>64</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> heard the blasphemy.</em><em> </em><em>What’s you</em><em>r</em><em> verdict?”</em> They ruled for the death penalty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup><strong>65</strong></sup>Some started spitting on him, blindfolding and slapping him, <em>“Say </em>who did that<em>!”</em> The officers took him, slapping him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 14:55-65</p>

### Peter’s Denials


<span class="verse" id="v66"><sup><strong>66</strong></sup>Peter was down below in the courtyard. A servant girl of the high priest came. <strong><sup>67</sup></strong>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him closely, <em>“You were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v68"><sup><strong>68</strong></sup>But he denied it, <em>“I don’t</em><em> </em><em>know what you’re talking about,” </em>and he went out to the entryway.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v69"><sup><strong>69</strong></sup>The servant girl saw him again and started telling the ones standing around, <em>“This </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> one of them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><sup><strong>70</strong></sup>He denied it again. A little later the ones standing around said, <em>“You really </em><em><u>are</u></em><em> one of them</em><em>;</em><em> you’re a Galilean.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v71"><sup><strong>71</strong></sup>He started taking oaths and swearing, <em>“I don’t know the man you’re talking about.”</em> <strong><sup>72</sup></strong>Immediately a rooster double-crowed, and Peter remembered: <em>“Before a rooster </em><em>double-crows</em><em>, you’ll deny me three times.”</em> He broke down sobbing.</span>
