## Mark Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Passover and Festival of Unleavened Bread was two days away. The chief priests and scribes were trying to find a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death. 2They said, "Not during the festival; the people will riot."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster cruise of expensive pure nard ointment. She broke open the alabaster cruise and poured it on his head. 4Some were expressing their indignation to one another, "Why has she wasted this ointment? 5She could've sold it for over 300 denarii and given it to the poor." They started fussing at her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She's done me a good turn. 7You always have poor people with you; you can do something good for them any time. You won't always havep me. 8She did what she could: she anointed my body ahead of time for burial. 9Wherever you deliver the good news in the world, tell what she's done in memory of her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the high priests to deliver Jesus to them. 11When they heard his offer, they were elated and promised to give him silver; so he started looking for a chance to turn him over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, his disciples said, "Where do you want us to get things ready for eating the Passover?" 13He sentp two disciples and saidp, "On the way into the city, you'll meet a man carrying a clay pot of water. Follow him, 14and where he goes in, say to the owner, 'The Rabbi says, "Where's the guest room so I can eat the Passover with my disciples?"' 15He'll show you a big room upstairs, furnished and set up. Get things ready there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The disciples went into the city and found it the way Jesus had said and got things ready.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He arrivedp that evening with the Twelve. 18As they were reclining at table eating, he saidp, "One of you that's eating with me is going to betray me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They became sad and said one by one, "It's not me, is it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He said, "It's one of the Twelve that's dipping with me in the bowl. 21The Son of Man will go like scripture says, but woe to the one that betrays him! It would've been better for him if he hadn't been born."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> During the meal Jesus took a loaf, blessed it, broke it, and handed it to them: "Take it; this is my body." 23He took a cup, blessed it, handed it to them, and they all drank out of it. 24He said, "This is my blood of the covenant that's shed for many. 25This is the last time I'll drink the fruit of the vine till I do it in God's kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Jesus toldp them, "You're all going to desert me because scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But after I resurrect, I'll go ahead of you to Galilee."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Peter said, "Even if everybody else deserts you, I won't."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus saidp, "I tell you, before a rooster double-crows in the morning, you're going to deny me three times."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He kept insisting, "Even if I have to die with you, I won't deny you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They camep to a place named Gethsemane, and he toldp his disciples, "Sit here while I pray." 33He tookp Peter, James, and John, and began to feel stress and dread. 34"I'm really stressed. Stay here and keep watch." 35He went on a little way and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if possible, the time would pass him by. 36"Abba (Father), you can do anything. Take this cup away from me. But not what I want, but what you want." 37He camep and foundp them sleeping and saidp to Simon, "You'resg sleeping? Couldn't yousg watch for one hour? 38Watchpl and pray so youpl won't be tempted. The spirit's willing but the flesh is weak." 39He went again and prayed the same thing. 40When he came back, he found them sleeping; they couldn't keep their eyes open. They didn't know what to say. 41He camep the third time, "You're still sleeping and resting? The time has come. The Son of Man is being betrayed to sinners. 42Get up; let's go! The one that's betraying me is coming."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> While he was still talking, Judas camep with a crowd from the chief priests, scribes, and elders, carryingpl swords and clubs. 44The traitor had given them a signal, "The one I kiss is him. Arrest him and take him away safely." 45He came right up to Jesus and saidp, "Rabbi," and kissed him. 46They grabbed jesus and arrested him. 47One of those standing by drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his ear. 48Jesus responded to them, "You've come out here with swords and clubs to arrest me like an insurgent? 49I was with you every day in the Temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. But this is happening to fulfill the scriptures." 50The disciples ran away. 51A young man was following him with a linen sheet around his naked body. They grabbed at him, 52but he left the sheet behind and fled naked. 53They took Jesus to the high priest. The chief priests, elders, and scribes convenedp. 54Peter followed him at a distance to the high priest's courtyard and sat down with the officers to warm himself at the fire. 55The chief priest and the full Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus so they could put him to death, but they couldn't find any. 56A number of people gave false testimony against him, but their testimonies didn't agree with each other. 57Some got up and gave false testimony, 58"We heard him say he'd tear down this sanctuary made with hands and build another one in three days without hands." 59Their testimonies didn't agree even on that point. 60The high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Aren't you going to answer anything these men are testifying against you?" 61He didn't answer. 63The high priest tore his clothes, "Why do we still need witnesses? 64You've heard the blasphemy. What's your verdict?" 65Some started spitting on him, blindfolding and slapping him, "Say who did that!" The officers took him, slapping him. 66Peter was down below in the courtyard. A servant girl of the high priest came. 67When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him closely, "You were with the Nazarene, Jesus." 68But he denied it, "I don't know what you're talking about," and he went out to the entryway. 69The servant girl saw him again and started telling the ones standing around, "This is one of them." 70He denied it again. A little later the ones standing around said, "You really are one of them; you're a Galilean." 71He started taking oaths and swearing, "I don't know the man you're talking about." 72Immediately a rooster double-crowed, and Peter remembered: "Before a rooster double-crows, you'll deny me three times." He broke down sobbing.</span>
