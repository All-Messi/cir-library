## Mark Chapter 7

### Miracles at Gennesaret

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>had seen some of his disciples eat<sup>p</sup> with defiled—unwashed—hands. (<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The Pharisees and all the Jews always wash their hands vigorously before they eat—keeping the tradition of the elders. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they come in from the marketplace, they don’t eat unless they take a bath. They keep many other customs—immersing cups, pitchers, bronze kettles [and bedrolls]<sup>ms</sup>.) <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They gathered around Jesus and asked, <em>“Why don’t your disciples </em><em>follow</em><em> </em><em>the tradition of the elders instead of eating with defiled hands?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He told them, <em>“Isaiah described you hypocrites well when he wrote:</em> 	<em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘This people honors me with their lips,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>but their heart is far from me.</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <strong><em>They</em></strong><strong><em> worship me without meaning anything,</em></strong><strong><em> and</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	 </em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>each</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>human rules </em></strong><strong><em>as </em></strong><strong>God’s </strong><strong><em>doctrines</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 29:13 LXX]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He called the crowd again, <em>“Listen, all of you, and </em><em>get this</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Nothing</em><em> that goes in you can defile you.</em><em> </em><em>It’s what comes out of you that defiles you.”</em> [<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>]<sup>ms</sup></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When he went into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the illustration.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> </em><em>get it</em><em> either?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t you know that nothing </em><em>that goes into you can defile you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>t</em><em> doesn’t go in</em><em>to</em><em> your heart, but in</em><em>to</em><em> your stomach</em><em>,</em><em> and is eliminated in the </em><em>toilet </em>(a comment that <em>cleanses all foods</em><em> ceremonially</em>)?<em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> comes out of you is what defiles you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>F</em><em>rom</em><em> the inside—from your heart—come</em><em> sinful</em><em> thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>adultery</em><em>, coveting, </em><em>evil intentions</em><em>, deception, </em><em>indecency, jealousy, pride, senselessness</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Sinful</em><em> things fro</em><em>m inside you are what </em><em>defile you.”</span>

### Healing the Syrophoenician Woman’s Daughter


<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> From there he traveled to the locale around Tyre and went into a house because he didn’t want anybody to know <em>it</em>, but he couldn’t hide. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Right away, a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down to him. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>She was a Greek, a Syrophoenician. She asked him to cast out the demon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He told her, <em>“Let the </em><em>kids</em><em> </em><em>eat</em><em> first.</em><em> </em><em>It’s not right to take their food and </em><em>toss</em><em> it to the dogs</em><em> in the house</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But she answered, <em>“Lord</em><em>, even house dogs under the table eat the </em><em>kids’</em><em> crumbs.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“Because</em><em> of </em><em>that comment</em><em>, </em>you can <em>go; the demon has left your daughter.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> When she went in her house, she found the little girl lying on her bed and the demon gone.</span>

### Ministry in Decapolis; 	Feeding the 4,000


<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He left the area around Tyre and traveled through Sidon to Lake Galilee in the territory of Decapolis. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They brought<sup>p</sup> him a deaf man with a speech impediment and asked<sup>p</sup> him to lay his hand on him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers in his ears and spit and touched his tongue. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He looked up at the sky, and made a groaning sound and said<sup>p</sup>, “<em>Ephphatha</em> <em>(</em><em>Open</em><em> up)</em>.” <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>His ears opened and his tongue freed up, and he started speaking clearly. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Jesus told the people not to tell anybody, but the more he told them to keep something quiet, the more they spread it around. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They were completely astonished, <em>“He’</em><em>s done everything well.</em><em> </em><em>He even makes deaf </em><em>people </em><em>hear and mute</em><em>s</em><em> speak.”</span>
