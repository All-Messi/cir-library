## Mark Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>had seen some of his disciples eat<sup>p</sup> with defiled—unwashed—hands. (<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The Pharisees and all the Jews always wash their hands vigorously before they eat—keeping the tradition of the elders. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they come in from the marketplace, they don’t eat unless they take a bath. They keep many other customs—immersing cups, pitchers, bronze kettles [and bedrolls]<sup>ms</sup>.) <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They gathered around Jesus and asked, <em>“Why don’t your disciples </em><em>follow</em><em> </em><em>the tradition of the elders instead of eating with defiled hands?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“Isaiah described you hypocrites well when he wrote:</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘This people honors me with their lips,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>but their heart is far from me.</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><em>They</em></strong><strong><em> worship me without meaning anything,</em></strong><strong><em> and</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	 </em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>each</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>human rules </em></strong><strong><em>as </em></strong><strong>God’s </strong><strong><em>doctrines</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 29:13 LXX]</strong>. <strong><sup>8-</sup></strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> neatly set aside </em><em>divine</em><em> commandment</em><em> </em><em>to establish </em><em>human</em><em> tradition.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> case in point:</em><em> </em><em>Moses said, </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Honor</em></strong><strong><em> your father and your mother</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex 20:12; Deut</strong><strong> 5:16]</strong><em>,</em><em> and, </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Put to death w</em></strong><strong><em>hoever </em></strong><strong><em>cusses at </em></strong><em>his</em><strong><em> father or mother</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 21:17]</strong><strong>.</strong><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> say, ‘If a person </em><em>tells</em><em> </em><em>his </em><em>father or mother, “Whatever wo</em><em>uld have helped you is ‘Corban (‘</em><em>Given</em><em>’).’</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou</em><em> let him do nothing for </em><em>his parents</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> negate God’s word with</em><em> </em>your<em> tradition.</em><em> </em><em>You do a lot of things like that.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He called the crowd again, <em>“Listen, all of you, and </em><em>get this</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Nothing</em><em> that goes in you can defile you.</em><em> </em><em>It’s what comes out of you that defiles you.”</em> [<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>]<sup>ms</sup></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When he went into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the illustration.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>From there he traveled to the locale around Tyre and went into a house because he didn’t want anybody to know <em>it</em>, but he couldn’t hide. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Right away, a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down to him. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>She was a Greek, a Syrophoenician. She asked him to cast out the demon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He told her, <em>“Let the </em><em>kids</em><em> </em><em>eat</em><em> first.</em><em> </em><em>It’s not right to take their food and </em><em>toss</em><em> it to the dogs</em><em> in the house</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But she answered, <em>“Lord</em><em>, even house dogs under the table eat the </em><em>kids’</em><em> crumbs.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> When she went in her house, she found the little girl lying on her bed and the demon gone.</span>

### Ministry in Decapolis; Feeding the 4,000


<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He left the area around Tyre and traveled through Sidon to Lake Galilee in the territory of Decapolis. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They brought<sup>p</sup> him a deaf man with a speech impediment and asked<sup>p</sup> him to lay his hand on him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers in his ears and spit and touched his tongue. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He looked up at the sky, and made a groaning sound and said<sup>p</sup>, “<em>Ephphatha</em> <em>(</em><em>Open</em><em> up)</em>.” <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>His ears opened and his tongue freed up, and he started speaking clearly. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Jesus told the people not to tell anybody, but the more he told them to keep something quiet, the more they spread it around. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They were completely astonished, <em>“He’</em><em>s done everything well.</em><em> </em><em>He even makes deaf </em><em>people </em><em>hear and mute</em><em>s</em><em> speak.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Mk 7:31-37</strong></span>
