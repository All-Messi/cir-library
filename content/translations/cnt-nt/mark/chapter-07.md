## Mark Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem 2had seen some of his disciples eatp with defiled—unwashed—hands. (3The Pharisees and all the Jews always wash their hands vigorously before they eat—keeping the tradition of the elders. 4When they come in from the marketplace, they don't eat unless they take a bath. They keep many other customs—immersing cups, pitchers, bronze kettles [and bedrolls]ms.) 5They gathered around Jesus and asked, "Why don't your disciples follow the tradition of the elders instead of eating with defiled hands?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He told them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They worship me without meaning anything, and teach human rules as God's doctrines' [Is 29:13 LXX]. 8-9You neatly set aside divine commandment to establish human tradition. 10A case in point: Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother' [Ex 20:12; Deut 5:16], and, 'Put to death whoever cusses at his father or mother' [Ex 21:17]. 11But you say, 'If a person tells his father or mother, "Whatever would have helped you is 'Corban ('Given').'" 12You let him do nothing for his parents. 13You negate God's word with your tradition. You do a lot of things like that."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He called the crowd again, "Listen, all of you, and get this. 15Nothing that goes in you can defile you. It's what comes out of you that defiles you." [16]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When he went into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the illustration. 18"Don't you get it either? Don't you know that nothing that goes into you can defile you. 19It doesn't go into your heart, but into your stomach, and is eliminated in the toilet (a comment that cleanses all foods ceremonially)? 20What comes out of you is what defiles you. 21From the inside—from your heart—come sinful thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, 22adultery, coveting, evil intentions, deception, indecency, jealousy, pride, senselessness. 23Sinful things from inside you are what defile you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> From there he traveled to the locale around Tyre and went into a house because he didn't want anybody to know it, but he couldn't hide. 25Right away, a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down to him. 26She was a Greek, a Syrophoenician. She asked him to cast out the demon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He told her, "Let the kids eat first. It's not right to take their food and toss it to the dogs in the house."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But she answered, "Lord, even house dogs under the table eat the kids' crumbs."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> When she went in her house, she found the little girl lying on her bed and the demon gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He left the area around Tyre and traveled through Sidon to Lake Galilee in the territory of Decapolis. 32They broughtp him a deaf man with a speech impediment and askedp him to lay his hand on him. 33He took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers in his ears and spit and touched his tongue. 34He looked up at the sky, and made a groaning sound and saidp, "Ephphatha (Open up)." 35His ears opened and his tongue freed up, and he started speaking clearly. 36Jesus told the people not to tell anybody, but the more he told them to keep something quiet, the more they spread it around. 37They were completely astonished, "He's done everything well. He even makes deaf people hear and mutes speak."</span>
