## Mark Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time again, the large crowd didn’t have anything to eat. Jesus called<sup>p</sup> the disciples over, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> </em><em>feel for</em><em> the crowd.</em><em> </em><em>They’ve stayed with me </em><em>three </em><em>days already and don’t have any food.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> I send them home hungry, they’ll </em><em>collapse</em><em> on the way.</em><em> </em><em>Some of them have come a long way.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> His disciples answered, <em>“Where </em><em>can anyone</em><em> satisfy them </em><em>out </em><em>here in the </em><em>open </em><em>country?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“How many loaves do you have?”</em> <em>	“</em><em>Seven</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He told<sup>p</sup> the crowd to sit down. He took the seven loaves, blessed them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They had a few small fish. He blessed them and said to pass them out too. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The people ate till they were full, and the <em>disciples</em> picked up seven large baskets of pieces. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>About 4,000 were there, and he dismissed them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Directly he got in the boat with his disciples and went to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.</span>

### Visit to Magadan; 	Demand for a Sign from the Sky


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They asked him, <em>“Why do the scribes say Elijah has to come first?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When they got back to the rest of the disciples, they saw a big crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When they saw him, the whole crowd was really surprised and ran to greet him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Jesus asked, <em>“Why are you arguing with them?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They brought him; and when the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and rolled around and foamed at the mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus asked his dad, <em>“How long has this been going on?”</em> <em>“Ever since he was little.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Lots</em><em> of times it’</em><em>s thrown him into </em><em>the </em><em>fire or </em><em>the </em><em>water to destroy him.</em><em> </em><em>But if you can, help us; have sympathy for us.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They went<sup>p</sup> to Bethsaida, and people brought<sup>p</sup> Jesus a blind man and asked<sup>p</sup> him to touch him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He led him by the hand out of the village. He spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, and asked, <em>“Do you see anything?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> His dad cried out, <em>“</em><em>I believe! H</em><em>elp my unbelief!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> When Jesus saw the crowd quickly coming together, he commanded the unclean spirit, <em>“Mute and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him and don’t go into him again.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> It cried out and threw him into severe convulsions and came out. The boy looked like he was dead, so much so that many of them said he’d died. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, <em>“Who are people saying I am?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When Jesus went into a house, his disciples asked him privately<em>, “Why couldn’t </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> cast it out?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“This</em><em> kind doesn’t come out except by prayer.”</span>

### Third Prediction of His Death


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They left and began traveling around Galilee. He didn’t want anybody to know it, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>because he was trying to teach his disciples, <em>“</em><em>I’m going to be betrayed to authorities </em><em>t</em><em>hat will </em><em>put </em><em>me</em><em> to death.</em><em> </em><em>Three days later </em><em>I</em><em>’ll resurrect.”</em> <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They didn’t understand, but they were reluctant to ask him about it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 9:30-32</p>

### Discussion About Rank


<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He started explaining to them that the Son of Man had a lot to suffer; be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes; be put to death, and resurrect after three days. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>He was talking about the matter openly, and Peter pulled him aside and began to scold him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He turned around and saw his disciples and scolded Peter, <em>“Get behind me, Satan.</em><em> </em><em>Your mind</em><em>’s not</em><em> on God’s interests, but </em><em>human</em><em> interests.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> He called the crowd with his disciples, <em>“If </em><em>people</em><em> want to follow me, </em><em>they have</em><em> to set </em><em>aside their</em><em> own interests, pick up </em><em>their</em><em> cross, and follow me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> wants to save </em><em>their</em><em> life will lose it; whoever loses </em><em>their</em><em> life </em><em>more than </em><em>me and the </em><em>good news</em><em> will save it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> good does it do </em><em>anyone</em><em> to g</em><em>ain</em><em> the whole world and forfeit </em><em>teir</em><em> life?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> would </em><em>they</em><em> give in exchange for </em><em>their</em><em> life?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>Whoeve</em><em>r’</em><em>s</em><em> ashamed of me an</em><em>d my message in this adulterous, sinful time</em><em>, </em><em>the Son of Man will</em><em> be ashamed of when he comes in his Father</em><em>’s glory with his holy angels. </em><strong>9</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong><em>Some</em><em> </em>of you <em>standing here will </em><em>certainly live to</em><em> see </em><em>God’s kingdom </em><em>come with power.”</span>
