## Mark Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>At that time again, the large crowd didn’t have anything to eat. Jesus called<sup>p</sup> the disciples over, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> </em><em>feel for</em><em> the crowd.</em><em> </em><em>They’ve stayed with me </em><em>three </em><em>days already and don’t have any food.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> I send them home hungry, they’ll </em><em>collapse</em><em> on the way.</em><em> </em><em>Some of them have come a long way.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Six days later Jesus took<sup>p</sup> Peter, James, and John up on a mountain by themselves, and was transfigured in front of them. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>His clothes turned brilliant white like no laundryman can bleach them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Elijah appeared with Moses, talking to Jesus. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Peter responded<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Rabbi, it’s good to be here.</em><em> </em><em>Should we set up three tents—one </em><em>each </em><em>for you, Moses, and Elijah?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He didn’t know what to say, because they were afraid. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A cloud surrounded them, and a voice came out of it, <em>“This is my </em><em>dearly </em><em>loved Son; listen to him.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Suddenly they looked around and didn’t see anybody but Jesus.</span>

### Discussing the Vision


<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His disciples answered, <em>“Where </em><em>can anyone</em><em> satisfy them </em><em>out </em><em>here in the </em><em>open </em><em>country?”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“How many loaves do you have?”</em> <em>	“</em><em>Seven</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>He told<sup>p</sup> the crowd to sit down. He took the seven loaves, blessed them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They had a few small fish. He blessed them and said to pass them out too. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The people ate till they were full, and the <em>disciples</em> picked up seven large baskets of pieces. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span>

### ,000 were there, and he dismissed them. 10Directly he got in the boat with his disciples and went to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.	 Mk 8:1-10 Visit to Magadan; Demand for a Sign from the Sky


<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>As they were coming down the mountain, he impressed on them not to pass on to anybody what they’d seen till the Son of Man arose from the dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They kept the matter to themselves and wondered what <em>“arising from the dead”</em> meant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>They asked him, <em>“Why do the scribes say Elijah has to come first?”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Elijah</em><em> does come first and restore everything, and how </em><em>does the scripture say</em><em> that the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> has to suffer many things and be rejected?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> Elijah has in fact come, and they </em><em>treated him however they wanted to, like</em><em> </em><em>scripture says</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em><strong> </strong></span>

### Healing the Demoniac Boy


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they got back to the rest of the disciples, they saw a big crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When they saw him, the whole crowd was really surprised and ran to greet him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Jesus asked, <em>“Why are you arguing with them?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A man in the crowd answered him, <em>“Rabbi, I brought you my boy. He </em><em>has a spirit that makes him unable to talk.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Wherever</em><em> it seizes him, it throws him on the ground.</em><em> </em><em>He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth; and it makes him </em><em>rigid</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I spoke to your disciples about casting it out, but they couldn’t do it.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“Unbelieving</em><em> bunch, how long am I going to be with you?</em><em> </em><em>How long am I going to deal with you?</em><em> </em><em>Bring him to me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>They brought him; and when the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and rolled around and foamed at the mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus asked his dad, <em>“How long has this been going on?”</em> <em>“Ever since he was little.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Lots</em><em> of times it’</em><em>s thrown him into </em><em>the </em><em>fire or </em><em>the </em><em>water to destroy him.</em><em> </em><em>But if you can, help us; have sympathy for us.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They went<sup>p</sup> to Bethsaida, and people brought<sup>p</sup> Jesus a blind man and asked<sup>p</sup> him to touch him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He led him by the hand out of the village. He spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, and asked, <em>“Do you see anything?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“If you can?</em><em> </em><em>Everythin</em><em>g’</em><em>s possible </em><em>for someone that </em><em>believes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His dad cried out, <em>“</em><em>I believe! H</em><em>elp my unbelief!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Jesus saw the crowd quickly coming together, he commanded the unclean spirit, <em>“Mute and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him and don’t go into him again.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>It cried out and threw him into severe convulsions and came out. The boy looked like he was dead, so much so that many of them said he’d died. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, <em>“Who are people saying I am?”</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“John</em><em> the Baptist; others, Elijah; others, that you’re one of the prophets.”</em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“Who</em><em> do </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> say I am?”</em> Peter answered, <em>“You’re the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When Jesus went into a house, his disciples asked him privately<em>, “Why couldn’t </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> cast it out?”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“This</em><em> kind doesn’t come out except by prayer.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

### Third Prediction of His Death


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>They left and began traveling around Galilee. He didn’t want anybody to know it, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>because he was trying to teach his disciples, <em>“</em><em>I’m going to be betrayed to authorities </em><em>t</em><em>hat will </em><em>put </em><em>me</em><em> to death.</em><em> </em><em>Three days later </em><em>I</em><em>’ll resurrect.”</em> <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They didn’t understand, but they were reluctant to ask him about it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 9:30-32</p>

### Discussion About Rank


<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He started explaining to them that the Son of Man had a lot to suffer; be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes; be put to death, and resurrect after three days. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>He was talking about the matter openly, and Peter pulled him aside and began to scold him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He turned around and saw his disciples and scolded Peter, <em>“Get behind me, Satan.</em><em> </em><em>Your mind</em><em>’s not</em><em> on God’s interests, but </em><em>human</em><em> interests.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When they came home to Capernaum, he asked them, <em>“What were you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> </em><em>arguing about</em><em> on the </em><em>road</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>They kept still because they’d been arguing about who had higher rank. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>He sat down and called the Twelve over, <em>“If anybody wants to be first, he’ll </em><em>put himself</em><em> last a</em><em>s</em><em> servant of all.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong>He took a little child and stood him among them and put his arms around him, <strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>“Whoever</em><em> receives one of these children in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives the One that sent me.”</em> <strong>The Unknown Exorcist</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He called the crowd with his disciples, <em>“If </em><em>people</em><em> want to follow me, </em><em>they have</em><em> to set </em><em>aside their</em><em> own interests, pick up </em><em>their</em><em> cross, and follow me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> wants to save </em><em>their</em><em> life will lose it; whoever loses </em><em>their</em><em> life </em><em>more than </em><em>me and the </em><em>good news</em><em> will save it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> good does it do </em><em>anyone</em><em> to g</em><em>ain</em><em> the whole world and forfeit </em><em>teir</em><em> life?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> would </em><em>they</em><em> give in exchange for </em><em>their</em><em> life?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>Whoeve</em><em>r’</em><em>s</em><em> ashamed of me an</em><em>d my message in this adulterous, sinful time</em><em>, </em><em>the Son of Man will</em><em> be ashamed of when he comes in his Father</em><em>’s glory with his holy angels. </em><strong>9</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong><em>Some</em><em> </em>of you <em>standing here will </em><em>certainly live to</em><em> see </em><em>God’s kingdom </em><em>come with power.”</em><strong>	      </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 8:31-9</p>

### :1 The Transfiguration


<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>John said, <em>“Rabbi, we saw a fellow casting out demons in your name and </em><em>tried to stop him</em><em> because he wasn’t following us.”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>“<em>Don’t</em><em> </em><em>stop</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> him.</em><em> </em><em>Nobody that performs a miracle in my name</em> <em>will</em><em> turn around </em><em>right away </em><em>and say something bad about me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> is not against us is for us.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> gives you a cup o</em><em>f water in my name because you’</em><em>re f</em><em>ollowing </em><em>the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, </em><em>will certainly not</em><em> </em><em>miss out on</em><em> his reward.</em><em> </em><strong>	   </strong></span>

### The Question of Stumbling Blocks 42“Whoever makes one of these little ones stumble that believes in me, would be better off to have a large millstone put around their neck and be thrown into the sea. 43If your hand causes you problems, cut it off. It’s better to go about life deformed than to have two hands and go to hell—into the unquenchable fire. [44]ms 45If your foot causes you problems, cut it off. It’s better to go about life deformed than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. [46]ms 47If your eye causes you problems, gouge it out. It’s better to get in God’s kingdom with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, 48where the worms don’t die, and the fire doesn’t burn out. 49“Everybody will be salted with fire. 50Salt’s good, but if it loses its saltiness, how will you make it salty? Have salt in yourselves and get along with each other.”	Mk 9:42-50 Jesus in Perea; Teaching About Divorce
