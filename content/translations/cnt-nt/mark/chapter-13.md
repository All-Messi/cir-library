## Mark Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> As he was leaving the Temple, one disciple saidp, "Rabbi, look at what wonderful stones and magnificent buildings!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Jesus said, "You see these large buildings? Not one stone will be left on top of another here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the Temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 4"Tell us when that will happen and what will indicate that it's about to happen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jesus told them, "Make sure nobody deceives you. 6Many will come, saying, 'I'm the Messiah,' and deceive lots of people. 7When you hear about wars and reports about wars, don't panic. They need to happen, but that's not the end yet. 8Nation will attack nation; kingdom will attack kingdom. There'll be earthquakes and famines in many places. They're the beginning of labor pains. 9"Watch out. They'll take you to court and flog you in the synagogues. You'll stand in front of governors and kings to speak for me. 10The good news needs to reach all the countries first. 11When they arrest you and put you on trial, don't worry about what you're going to say. Say what comes to you at that time; you won't be the ones speaking; it'll be the Holy Spirit. 12Brother will betray brother to death, and father will betray child. Children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. 13People will hate you because of me. The one that endures to the end will be saved. 14"When you see 'the abomination of desolation' positioned where it shouldn't be (reader, understand), people in Judaea need to flee to the hill country. 15The one on the housetop must not go down to get what's in the house. 16The one in the field must not go home to get his cloak. 17Woe to those who are pregnant or nursing then. 18Pray that it won't happen in the wintertime. 19Those days will be the worst ever—from the beginning of God's creation till now or ever will be. 20If the LORD hadn't shortened them, nobody would survive. But, because of the Chosen, he has shortened them. 21"If anybody says, 'Here's the Messiah,' or 'There's the Messiah,' don't believe it. 22False Messiahs and false prophets will arise and give signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the Chosen. 23But you be careful. I've told you all this ahead of time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Stars will fall from the sky, and</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then people will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds [Dan 7:13-14] with great power and glory. 27He'll send out his angels to gather the Chosen from every direction, from the end of earth to the end of sky. 28"Take a lesson from a fig tree. When its branches get tender and sprout leaves, you know summer's coming. 29The same way, when you see these things happening, you know he's at the door. 30They'll take place in this generation. 31Earth and sky will pass away, but what I say won't pass away. 32"Nobody knows about that day or hour—not the angels in heaven, not the Son of Man, only the Father. 33Be careful, stay alert; you don't know when it will happenp. 34A man leaving on a trip gives each servant the authority to do his job and tells the doorkeeper to stay alert. 35Watch; you don't know when the master of the household will come back—in the evening, at midnight, at rooster crowing, or in the morning—36so if he comes unexpectedly, he won't catch you sleeping. 37What I'm saying I'm saying to all of you. Watch!"</span>
