### :1 	The Transfiguration

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Some of you standing here will certainly live to see God's kingdom come with power."</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 8:31-9</p>

### :1 The Transfiguration


<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Six days later Jesus tookp Peter, James, and John up on a mountain by themselves, and was transfigured in front of them. 3His clothes turned brilliant white like no laundryman can bleach them. 4Elijah appeared with Moses, talking to Jesus. 5Peter respondedp, "Rabbi, it's good to be here. Should we set up three tents—one each for you, Moses, and Elijah?" 6He didn't know what to say, because they were afraid. 7A cloud surrounded them, and a voice came out of it, "This is my dearly loved Son; listen to him." 8Suddenly they looked around and didn't see anybody but Jesus. Discussing the Vision</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> As they were coming down the mountain, he impressed on them not to pass on to anybody what they'd seen till the Son of Man arose from the dead. 10They kept the matter to themselves and wondered what "arising from the dead" meant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They asked him, "Why do the scribes say Elijah has to come first?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> "Elijah does come first and restore everything, and how does the scripture say that the Son of Man has to suffer many things and be rejected? 13But Elijah has in fact come, and they treated him however they wanted to, like scripture says." Healing the Demoniac Boy</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When they got back to the rest of the disciples, they saw a big crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. 15When they saw him, the whole crowd was really surprised and ran to greet him. 16Jesus asked, "Why are you arguing with them?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A man in the crowd answered him, "Rabbi, I brought you my boy. He has a spirit that makes him unable to talk. 18Wherever it seizes him, it throws him on the ground. He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth; and it makes him rigid. I spoke to your disciples about casting it out, but they couldn't do it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> "Unbelieving bunch, how long am I going to be with you? How long am I going to deal with you? Bring him to me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They brought him; and when the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and rolled around and foamed at the mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus asked his dad, "How long has this been going on?" "Ever since he was little. 22Lots of times it's thrown him into the fire or the water to destroy him. But if you can, help us; have sympathy for us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus said, "If you can? Everything's possible for someone that believes."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> His dad cried out, "I believe! Help my unbelief!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> When Jesus saw the crowd quickly coming together, he commanded the unclean spirit, "Mute and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him and don't go into him again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> It cried out and threw him into severe convulsions and came out. The boy looked like he was dead, so much so that many of them said he'd died. 27But Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When Jesus went into a house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> "This kind doesn't come out except by prayer." Third Prediction of His Death</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They left and began traveling around Galilee. He didn't want anybody to know it, 31because he was trying to teach his disciples, "I'm going to be betrayed to authorities that will put me to death. Three days later I'll resurrect." 32They didn't understand, but they were reluctant to ask him about it. Discussion About Rank</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When they came home to Capernaum, he asked them, "What were youpl arguing about on the road?" 34They kept still because they'd been arguing about who had higher rank. 35He sat down and called the Twelve over, "If anybody wants to be first, he'll put himself last as servant of all." 36He took a little child and stood him among them and put his arms around him, 37"Whoever receives one of these children in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives the One that sent me." The Unknown Exorcist</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> John said, "Rabbi, we saw a fellow casting out demons in your name and tried to stop him because he wasn't following us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> "Don't stoppl him. Nobody that performs a miracle in my name will turn around right away and say something bad about me. 40Whoever is not against us is for us. 41Whoever gives you a cup of water in my name because you're following the Messiah, will certainly not miss out on his reward. The Question of Stumbling Blocks</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> "Whoever makes one of these little ones stumble that believes in me, would be better off to have a large millstone put around their neck and be thrown into the sea. 43If your hand causes you problems, cut it off. It's better to go about life deformed than to have two hands and go to hell—into the unquenchable fire. [44]ms 45If your foot causes you problems, cut it off. It's better to go about life deformed than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. [46]ms 47If your eye causes you problems, gouge it out. It's better to get in God's kingdom with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, 48where the worms don't die, and the fire doesn't burn out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> "Everybody will be salted with fire. 50Salt's good, but if it loses its saltiness, how will you make it salty? Have salt in yourselves and get along with each other." Jesus in Perea; Teaching About Divorce</span>
