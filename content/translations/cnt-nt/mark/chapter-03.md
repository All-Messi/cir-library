## Mark Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Again he went into a synagogue. A man with a paralyzed hand was there. 2Pharisees were watching to see if he'd heal him on Sabbath so they could accuse him. 3He toldp the man, "Stand up." 4He askedp them, "Is it lawful to do good on Sabbath or to do bad, to save life or take life?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He looked around at them angry, dismayed at their lack of compassion. He toldp the fellow, "Hold out your hand." He did, and it was restored. 6The Pharisees left right away to plot with the Herodians to destroy him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jesus went with his disciples to the side of the lake. A huge crowd followed him from Galilee, Judaea, 8Jerusalem, Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon. They came because they heard about the things he was doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told his disciples to bring a boat up close so the crowd wouldn't throng him. 10He'd healed so many people that everybody with an ailment was crowding up to touch him. 11When unclean spirits would see him, they'd kneel down to him and cry out, "You're God's Son." 12He'd strictly order them not to tell who he was.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He went upp on a mountain and called the ones he wanted. 14He appointed twelve and named them apostles.  He appointed them to be with him so he could "send" them out to preach 15and have authority to cast out demons. 16The Twelve were Simon, that he named Peter; 17James and John, sons of Zebedee, that he nicknamed Boanerges (Sons of Thunder); 18Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas; James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, 19and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He camep home, and again such a crowd gatheredp that he and his disciples couldn't even eat. 21When his neighbors heard about it, they went out to rescue him, because they said he was out of his mind. 22Scribes from Jerusalem were saying he had Beelzebub—that he was casting out demons by the ruler of demons. 23He called them over and gave them an illustration: "What sense does it make to say Satan casts out Satan? 24A kingdom at cross purposes with itself can't stand. 25A family at cross purposes with itself can't stand. 26If Satan opposes himself and is at cross purposes, he can't stand. 27Nobody can go into a strong man's house and seize his property unless he ties him up first. Then he can ransack his house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I tell you, any sin can be forgiven, including blasphemy; 29but anybody that blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they're guilty of permanent sin" (30He gave that warning because they were saying he had an unclean spirit.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> His mother and brothers camep and stood outside and sent him a message, calling him. 32The crowd sitting around saidp, "Your mother and brothers are outside, wanting to talk to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He answeredp, "Who are my mother and my brothers?" 34He looked around at the ones sitting around him, "My mother and my brothers! 35Whoever does God's will, is my brother, my sister, my mother."</span>
