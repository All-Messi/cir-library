## Mark Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Again he went into a synagogue. A man with a paralyzed hand was there. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Pharisees</em> were watching to see if he’d heal him on Sabbath so they could accuse him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He told<sup>p</sup> the man, <em>“Stand up.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He asked<sup>p</sup> them, <em>“Is it </em><em>lawful to do good on Sabbath</em><em> or to do </em><em>bad</em><em>, to save life or take life?”</em><em> </em> They didn’t say anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>He looked around at them angry, dismayed at their lack of compassion. He told<sup>p</sup> the fellow, <em>“Hold out your hand.”</em> He did, and it was restored. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The Pharisees left right away to plot with the Herodians to destroy him.</span>

### Jesus and the Multitudes


<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus went with his disciples to the side of the lake. A huge crowd followed him from Galilee, Judaea, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jerusalem, Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon. They came because they heard about the things he was doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He told his disciples to bring a boat up close so the crowd wouldn’t throng him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He’d healed so many people that everybody with an ailment was crowding up to touch him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When unclean spirits would see him, they’d kneel down to him and cry out, <em>“You’re God’s Son.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He’d strictly order them not to tell who he was.</span>

### Calling the Twelve Apostles


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>He went up<sup>p</sup> on a mountain and called the ones he wanted. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He appointed twelve and named them apostles.  <em>He appointed them </em>to be with him so he could “send” them out to preach <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and have authority to cast out demons. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>T</em><em>welve were </em>Simon, that he named Peter; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>James and John, sons of Zebedee, that he nicknamed Boanerges (Sons of Thunder); <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas; James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and Judas Iscariot, who <em>later </em>betrayed him.</span>

### The Pharisees’ Charge That  Jesus Was in League with the Devil


<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He came<sup>p</sup> home, and again such a crowd gathered<sup>p</sup> that <em>he and his disciples</em> couldn’t even eat. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When his neighbors heard about it, they went out to rescue him, because they said he was out of his mind. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Scribes from Jerusalem were saying he had Beelzebub—that he was casting out demons by the ruler of demons. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He called them over and gave them an illustration: <em>“</em><em>What sense does it make to say</em><em> Satan cast</em><em>s</em><em> out Satan?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> kingdom </em><em>at cross purposes with</em><em> itself can’t stand.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> </em><em>family</em><em> </em><em>at cross purposes with</em><em> itself can’t stand.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> Satan </em><em>opposes</em><em> himself and is </em><em>at cross purposes</em><em>, he can’t stand.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Nobody</em><em> can go in</em><em>to</em><em> a strong man’s house and seize his property unless he ties</em><em> him</em><em> up </em><em>first</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Then he can ransack </em>his<em> house.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> tell yo</em><em>u, any sin</em><em> can be forgiven, including blasphemy; </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>but</em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>any</em><em>body that b</em><em>lasphemes the Holy Spirit will n</em><em>ever be forgiven; </em><em>they’re guilty of </em><em>permanent sin”</em> (<strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He gave that warning because they were saying he had an unclean spirit.)<em> </em><strong>	        </strong></span>

### Jesus’ Mother and Brothers  Interrupt His Ministry


<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>His mother and brothers came<sup>p</sup> and stood outside and sent him a message, calling him. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>The crowd sitting around said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Your mother and brothers are outside</em><em>, wanting </em><em>to talk to you.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He answered<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He looked around at the ones sitting around him, <em>“My mother and my brothers!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> does God’s will, is my brother, my sister, my mother</em><em>.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
