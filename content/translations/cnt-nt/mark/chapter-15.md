## Mark Chapter **15**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>At daylight, the chief priests held session with the elders, scribes, and full Sanhedrin. They bound Jesus and led him away to Pilate. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Pilate asked him, <em>“Are you the </em><em>‘K</em><em>ing of the Jews</em><em>’</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The chief priests accused him of all kinds of things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Pilate asked him again, <em>“You’re not saying anything?</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ook at all the</em><em> things they’re accusing you of.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus still didn’t answer. Pilate was surprised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>At each festival, Pilate would release a prisoner that they asked for. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A prisoner called Barabbas was incarcerated with insurgents that<sup>pl</sup> had committed murder in the uprising. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The crowd came forward and started asking Pilate to do as he customarily did for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Pilate answered, <em>“Do you want me to release </em><em>‘</em><em>the </em><em>K</em><em>ing of the Jews</em><em>’</em><em>?”</em> (<strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He knew the high priests had delivered him over because they envied him.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But the high priests stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Pilate answered again, <em>“What do you want me to do then with the one you call ‘the K</em><em>ing of the Jews’?”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“Crucify</em><em> him!”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“What’s</em><em> he done?”</em> They shouted louder, <em>“Crucify him!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Pilate wanted to quiet the crowd, so he released Barabbas and delivered Jesus to be flogged and crucified.</span>

### Torture by the Roman Soldiers


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>The soldiers took him into the court—The Praetorium—and got the whole cohort together. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They dressed him in purple and twisted together a crown made out of thorns and put it on him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They began to acclaim him, “<em>Hail, K</em><em>ing of the Jews!”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and were beating him on the head with a reed, spitting on him, and kneeling and bowing to him. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When they were done making fun of him, they took off the purple robe and dressed him in his own clothes, and took<sup>p</sup> him away to crucify him.</span>

### The Way to Golgotha


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>They conscripted<sup>p</sup> Simon, a Cyrenian coming in from the countryside—father of Alexander and Rufus—to carry his cross. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>They took<sup>p</sup> him to Golgotha (“The Skull”), <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he didn’t take it. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When they’d crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots for what each soldier would take.</span>

You that tear down the sanctuary and rebuild it in </em><em>three</em><em> days, </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>save</em><em> yourself</em><em>; </em><em>come down from the cross!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The chief priests along with scribes made fun of him too, <em>“He saved othe</em><em>r people; he can’t save himself! </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>Messiah</em><em>, K</em><em>ing of Israel, come down now from the </em><em>cross so we can see and believe!</em><em>”</em> Even the ones crucified with him were insulting him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>One man ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink, <em>“Let’s see if Elijah will come and take him down.”</em></span>

### Miracles Accompanying Messiah’s Death


<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The curtain in the sanctuary tore in two, top to bottom. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>When the centurion standing beside him saw the way he quit breathing, he said, <em>“This</em><em> man really was God’s Son.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>Some women watching from a distance included Mary the Magdalene; Mary, mother of James the Less and Joses; and Salome. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>When he was in Galilee, they traveled with him and helped him.

### The Burial of Jesus and Watch at the Tomb


<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When evening came, since it was Preparation, the day before Sabbath, <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>Joseph of Arimathea—a respected member of the Sanhedrin, who was waiting for God’s kingdom—gathered the courage to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus’ body. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>Pilate was surprised that he’d already died. He called the centurion to ask him if Jesus was dead already. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>When he understood from him that Jesus was dead, he let Joseph have the body. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>Joseph had bought a linen sheet; he took Jesus down and wrapped him in it. He put him in a rock-hewn tomb and rolled a stone over the entrance. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>Mary the Magdalene and Mary, mother of Joseph, watched where they laid him.</span>
