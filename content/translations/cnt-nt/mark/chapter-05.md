## Mark Chapter 5

### Healing the Gadarene Demoniacs

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> They came to the other side of the lake, to the area of the Gerasenes. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As soon as he got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit met him from the tombs. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He’d been living in the tombs, and nobody could tie him up anymore. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>People had often bound him with shackles and chains. He’d pulled the chains apart and break the shackles in pieces. Nobody was strong enough to subdue him. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Constantly day and night in the tombs and in the hills, he’d scream and cut himself with stones. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When he saw Jesus a long way off, he ran and bowed to him <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and screamed<sup>p</sup>, <em>“What</em><em> is this, Jesus, Son of God Most High! </em><em>I beg you by God not to torment me</em><em>!</em><em>”</em> (<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He said that because Jesus had told the unclean spirit to come out of him<em>.</em>)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He asked him, <em>“What’s your name?”</em> <em>“‘</em><em>Legion</em><em>’</em><em>;</em><em> there are lots of us.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He begged Jesus not to send them away from the area. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>A tremendous herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Send</em><em> us into the pigs.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He let them. They went into the herd of about 2,000, which stampeded down the steep hill into the lake and drowned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The herdsmen ran away and reported it in town and in the countryside, and people came to see what had happened. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They came<sup>p</sup> over to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there dressed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The people that had seen it described to them how it was with the demoniac and the pigs. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The people begged Jesus to leave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> As he was getting in the boat, the demoniac begged to go along; <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>but Jesus told<sup>p</sup> him, <em>“Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and </em><em>how he </em><em>was merciful to you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He went and told in the Decapolis what all Jesus had done for him, and everybody was amazed.</span>

### Raising Jairus’ Daughter; 	Healing a Woman with Chronic Hemorrhaging


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When Jesus crossed back over to the other side in the boat, a big crowd had gathered beside the lake. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>A ruler of the synagogue, named Jairus, saw him and came<sup>p</sup> and fell down<sup>p</sup> to him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He pleaded<sup>p</sup>, <em>“My </em><em>little girl</em><em> </em><em>is at the point of death</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Please c</em><em>ome and lay hands on her so she’ll </em><em>live.”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Jesus went with him. A big crowd was following him and pressing in on him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>A woman there had been hemorrhaging for twelve years. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>She’d been put through a lot by doctors and spent everything she had without any benefit—but got worse. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes. She’d said, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“If</em><em> I can just touch his clothes, I’ll be cured.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Instantly her bleeding stopped. She could tell in her body that she was healed from the scourge she’d been dealing with for so long.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> At once Jesus sensed that power had gone out of him. He turned around in the crowd, <em>“Who touched my clothes?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> His disciples said, <em>“You see the crowd pressing in on you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He kept looking around to see who did it. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The woman, afraid and trembling, knew what had happened to her. She came and fell down to him and admitted the whole thing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> <em>“Daughter</em><em>, your faith has cured you.</em><em> Have a good day</em><em> and stay healed from your ailment.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> While he was speaking, they came<sup>p</sup> from the synagogue ruler’s house, <em>“Your daughter has died; why </em><em>bother</em><em> the </em><em>Rabbi</em><em> </em><em>anymore</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> But Jesus overheard the message and told<sup>p</sup> the synagogue ruler, <em>“Don’t give up; just trust me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> He only let Peter, James, and his brother John follow him. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>When he came<sup>p</sup> to the man’s house and saw the crying and loud wailing, <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>he went in and said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Why are you making such a</em><em> scene</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>The girl’s not dead; she’s </em><em>‘asleep</em><em>.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong>They started ridiculing him. He put them all out and took her parents and the three with him into where the girl was. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He took her hand, “<em>Talitha, qum</em> <em>(</em><em>Girl, get up</em><em>)</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong>She stood up right away and started walking around. (She was twelve.) They were completely astounded. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>He gave them strict orders that nobody should know about this and told them to give her something to eat.</span>
