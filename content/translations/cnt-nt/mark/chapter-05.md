## Mark Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> They came to the other side of the lake, to the area of the Gerasenes. 2As soon as he got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit met him from the tombs. 3He'd been living in the tombs, and nobody could tie him up anymore. 4People had often bound him with shackles and chains. He'd pulled the chains apart and break the shackles in pieces. Nobody was strong enough to subdue him. 5Constantly day and night in the tombs and in the hills, he'd scream and cut himself with stones. 6When he saw Jesus a long way off, he ran and bowed to him 7and screamedp, "What is this, Jesus, Son of God Most High! I beg you by God not to torment me!" (8He said that because Jesus had told the unclean spirit to come out of him.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He asked him, "What's your name?" "'Legion'; there are lots of us." 10He begged Jesus not to send them away from the area. 11A tremendous herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside. 12"Send us into the pigs." 13He let them. They went into the herd of about 2,000, which stampeded down the steep hill into the lake and drowned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The herdsmen ran away and reported it in town and in the countryside, and people came to see what had happened. 15They camep over to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there dressed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. 16The people that had seen it described to them how it was with the demoniac and the pigs. 17The people begged Jesus to leave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> As he was getting in the boat, the demoniac begged to go along; 19but Jesus toldp him, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he was merciful to you." 20He went and told in the Decapolis what all Jesus had done for him, and everybody was amazed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When Jesus crossed back over to the other side in the boat, a big crowd had gathered beside the lake. 22A ruler of the synagogue, named Jairus, saw him and camep and fell downp to him. 23He pleadedp, "My little girl is at the point of death. Please come and lay hands on her so she'll live." 24Jesus went with him. A big crowd was following him and pressing in on him. 25A woman there had been hemorrhaging for twelve years. 26She'd been put through a lot by doctors and spent everything she had without any benefit—but got worse. 27When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes. She'd said, 28"If I can just touch his clothes, I'll be cured." 29Instantly her bleeding stopped. She could tell in her body that she was healed from the scourge she'd been dealing with for so long.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> At once Jesus sensed that power had gone out of him. He turned around in the crowd, "Who touched my clothes?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> His disciples said, "You see the crowd pressing in on you and you say, 'Who touched me?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He kept looking around to see who did it. 33The woman, afraid and trembling, knew what had happened to her. She came and fell down to him and admitted the whole thing. 34"Daughter, your faith has cured you. Have a good day and stay healed from your ailment."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> While he was speaking, they camep from the synagogue ruler's house, "Your daughter has died; why bother the Rabbi anymore?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> But Jesus overheard the message and toldp the synagogue ruler, "Don't give up; just trust me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> He only let Peter, James, and his brother John follow him. 38When he camep to the man's house and saw the crying and loud wailing, 39he went in and saidp, "Why are you making such a scene? The girl's not dead; she's 'asleep.'" 40They started ridiculing him. He put them all out and took her parents and the three with him into where the girl was. 41He took her hand, "Talitha, qum (Girl, get up)." 42She stood up right away and started walking around. (She was twelve.) They were completely astounded. 43He gave them strict orders that nobody should know about this and told them to give her something to eat.</span>
