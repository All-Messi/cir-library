## Mark Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Another time he was trying to teach by the lake, but the crowd wasp so big he got in a boat on the water and sat down. The crowd was on the shore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He started teaching them with parables. 3"Listen. A sower went out to sow. 4As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and birds came and ate it. 5Some fell on rocky ground, where there wasn't much soil. It sprouted up right away because the soil was thin. 6But when the sun climbed high, it scorched and shriveled up because it didn't have roots. 7Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it out, and it didn't produce anything. 8But other seed fell on good ground, grew up, and produced 30, 60, 100 times over. 9Whoever has ears, listen!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When he was by himself, the ones around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables. 11He told them, "You're allowed to know the unrevealed things about God's kingdom, but to people outside I'm doing things in parables 12so 13"You don't understand this parable? How will you understand any parable? 14A sower sows the message. Some deeds fall beside the path where the message is sown. 15When they hear it, Satan comes at once and takes away what was sown in them. 16Some fall on rocky soil. When they hear the message, they're glad and accept it right away. 17But they don't have root in themselves and just last a while. When trouble or persecution comes on account of the message, they stumble. 18Some seeds fall among thorns. They hear the message; 19but the cares of this age, the deception of wealth, the desire for other things enter in and choke them out, and they don't produce anything. 20Others fall on good ground; they hear the message, accept it, and produce 30, 60, 100 times as much as was sown." 21"People don't take a lamp and stick it under a basket, do they? They put it on a stand. 22Nothing is hidden that won't be revealed; nothing is secret that won't come to light. 23Whoever has ears, listen!" 24"Be careful what you listen to. The measure you measure with, you'll be measured by—and more so. 25Those who have, will receive more; those who don't have, will lose even what they do have." 26"God's kingdom is like a man that puts seed in the ground. 27He sleeps and gets up day after day, but he doesn't know how the seed sprouts and grows. 28The ground produces crops on its own—the stalk, the head, then the seed in the head. 29When the crop is ripe, he gets out his scythe to harvest it." 30"What can we compare God's kingdom to? What's it like? 31It's like a mustard seed, which is smaller than any other seed people plant. 32Yet it grows up bigger than the other garden plants and puts out branches, so birds build nests in its shade.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Only with parables like those was he delivering the message to them as they could understand. 34Privately he'd explain them to his disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> That evening he saidp, "Let's go to the other side." 36They left the crowd and took him along in the boat like he was; some other boats went along. 37A dangerous storm came upp and was sloshing waves into the boat, and it was filling up. 38He was in the back of the boat, sleeping on a cushion. They wokep him up, "Rabbi, don't you care that we're going to die?" 39Now that he was awake, he rebuked the wind, and a general calm settled in. 40He said, "Why are you so scared? Don't you trust me yet?" 41They were even more scared now, "Who is this that even the wind and waves obey?"</span>
