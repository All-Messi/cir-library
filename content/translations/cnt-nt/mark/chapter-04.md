## Mark Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Another time he was trying to teach by the lake, but the crowd was<sup>p</sup> so big he got in a boat on the water and sat down. The crowd was on the shore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He started teaching them with parables.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>When he was by himself, the ones around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“You’re allowed to know the </em><em>unrevealed </em><em>things about </em><em>God’s kingdom, but to people </em><em>outside </em><em>I’m doing things</em><em> in parables </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>so</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘Th</em></strong><strong><em>ey’ll certainly see, but not</em></strong><strong><em> perceive</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>they’ll certainly</em></strong><strong><em> hear</em></strong><strong><em>, but not</em></strong><strong><em> understand, </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	be converted, and </em></strong> <strong><em>I </em></strong><strong><em>forgive</em></strong><strong><em> them’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 6:9-10].</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Mk </strong><strong>4:1-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Only with parables like those was he delivering the message to them as they could understand. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Privately he’d explain them to his disciples.</span>

### -34 Stilling the Storm


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> That evening he said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Let’s go to the other side.”</em> <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>They left the crowd and took him along in the boat like he was; <em>some</em> other boats went along. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>A dangerous storm came up<sup>p</sup> and was sloshing waves into the boat, and it was filling up. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><u>He</u> was in the back of the boat, sleeping on a cushion. They woke<sup>p</sup> him up, <em>“Rabbi, don’t you care that we’re </em><em>going to die</em><em>?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Now that he was awake, he rebuked the wind, and a general calm settled in. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Why are you so scared?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t you trust me yet?”</em> <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>They were even more scared now, <em>“Who </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> this that even the wind and waves obey?” </em><em>	</em><strong>Mk 4:35-41</strong> <strong>Healing the Gadarene Demoniacs</strong></span>
