## Mark Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Another time he was trying to teach by the lake, but the crowd was<sup>p</sup> so big he got in a boat on the water and sat down. The crowd was on the shore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He started teaching them with parables. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>“<em>Listen</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>A sower went out to sow.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and birds came and ate it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Some</em><em> fell on rocky ground, where there wasn’t much soil</em><em>. I</em><em>t sprouted up right away because the soil was thin.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> when the sun climbed high, it scorched and shriveled up because it didn’t have roots.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Other</em><em> seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it out, and it didn’t produce anything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> othe</em><em>r seed fell on good ground, </em><em>grew up</em><em>,</em><em> and produced </em><em>30, 60, 100 times over</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> has ears</em><em>, </em><em>listen</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>When he was by himself, the ones around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“You’re allowed to know the </em><em>unrevealed </em><em>things about </em><em>God’s kingdom, but to people </em><em>outside </em><em>I’m doing things</em><em> in parables </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>so</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘Th</em></strong><strong><em>ey’ll certainly see, but not</em></strong><strong><em> perceive</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>they’ll certainly</em></strong><strong><em> hear</em></strong><strong><em>, but not</em></strong><strong><em> understand, </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	be converted, and </em></strong> <strong><em>I </em></strong><strong><em>forgive</em></strong><strong><em> them’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 6:9-10].</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Mk </strong><strong>4:1-12</strong> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>You don’t</em><em> understand this parable?</em><em> </em><em>How will you understand any parable?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> sower sows the </em><em>message</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Some </em>deeds <em>fall</em><em> beside the path where the </em><em>message</em><em> is sown.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> they hear it, Satan comes at once and takes away </em><em>what </em><em>was sown in them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Some</em><em> </em><em>fall</em><em> on rocky soil.</em><em> </em><em>When they hear the </em><em>message</em><em>, they</em><em>’re glad and</em><em> </em><em>accept</em><em> it right away.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> they don’t have root in themselves and </em><em>just </em><em>last a while.</em><em> </em><em>When trouble or persecution comes </em><em>on account of</em><em> the </em><em>message</em><em>, they stumble.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Some</em><em> </em>seeds<em> </em><em>fall</em><em> among thorns.</em><em> They</em><em> hear the </em><em>message</em><em>; </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> the cares of this age, the deception of wealth, the desire for other things enter in and choke</em><em> them</em><em> out, and </em><em>they</em><em> don’t produce anything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Others</em><em> fall on good ground;</em><em> </em><em>they</em><em> hear the </em><em>message</em><em>, </em><em>accept it, and pr</span>

### , 60, 100 times as much as was sown.” 	21“People don’t take a lamp and stick it under a basket, do they? They put it on a stand. 22Nothing is hidden that won’t be revealed; nothing is secret that won’t come to light. 23Whoever has ears, listen!” 24“Be careful what you listen to. The measure you measure with, you’ll be measured by—and more so. 25Those who have, will receive more; those who don’t have, will lose even what they do have.”	Mk 4:13-25 	26“God’s kingdom is like a man that puts seed in the ground. 27He sleeps and gets up day after day, but he doesn’t know how the seed sprouts and grows. 28The ground produces crops on its own—the stalk, the head, then the seed in the head. 29When the crop is ripe, he gets out his scythe to harvest it.” 	30“What can we compare God’s kingdom to? What’s it like? 31It’s like a mustard seed, which is smaller than any other seed people plant. 32Yet it grows up bigger than the other garden plants and puts out branches, so birds build nests in its shade.

### -34 Stilling the Storm


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>That evening he said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Let’s go to the other side.”</em> <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>They left the crowd and took him along in the boat like he was; <em>some</em> other boats went along. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>A dangerous storm came up<sup>p</sup> and was sloshing waves into the boat, and it was filling up. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><u>He</u> was in the back of the boat, sleeping on a cushion. They woke<sup>p</sup> him up, <em>“Rabbi, don’t you care that we’re </em><em>going to die</em><em>?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Now that he was awake, he rebuked the wind, and a general calm settled in. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Why are you so scared?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t you trust me yet?”</em> <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>They were even more scared now, <em>“Who </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> this that even the wind and waves obey?” </em><em>	</em></span>
