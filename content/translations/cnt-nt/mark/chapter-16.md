## Mark Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Sabbath had passed, Mary the Magdalene; Mary, mother of James; and Salome bought aromatic oils to put on his body. 2Very early on the first day of the week, they camep to the tomb as the sun was just starting to come up. 3They were saying to one another, "Who's going to roll the stone away for us from the entrance to the tomb?" 4When they looked up, they sawp the big stone had been rolled away. 5They went into the tomb and saw a young man sitting on the right wearing a white robe, and they were startled. 6He saidp, "Don't be startled. You're looking for Jesus the Nazarene that was crucified. He's not here; he resurrected. See where they laid him. 7Go tell his disciples and Peter, 'He's going on ahead of you to Galilee. You'll see him there like he said.'" 8They went out and ran from the tomb because trembling and excitement gripped them. They didn't talk to anybody because they were afraid. [[9After he'd resurrected early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, that he'd cast seven demons out of. 10She reported it to the ones that had been with him, who were mourning and crying. 11When they heard she'd seen him alive, they didn't believe it.    [Mk 16:9-11]</span>

[Mk 16:12-14]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He told them, "Go all over the world and tell everybody the good news. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever disbelieves will be condemned. 17These signs will follow the ones that believe:</span>
