## Mark Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Sabbath had passed, Mary the Magdalene; Mary, mother of James; and Salome bought aromatic oils to put on his body. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Very early on the first day of the week, they came<sup>p</sup> to the tomb as the sun was just starting to come up. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They were saying to one another, <em>“Who’s going to roll the stone away for us from the entrance to the tomb?”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they looked up, they saw<sup>p</sup> the big stone had been rolled away. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They went into the tomb and saw a young man sitting on the right wearing a white robe, and they were startled. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Don’t be </em><em>startled</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>You’re looking for Jesus the Na</em><em>zarene that was crucified. H</em><em>e’s not here</em><em>; he</em><em> resurrected.</em><em> </em><em>See where they laid him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He’s going </em><em>on </em><em>ahead of you </em><em>to</em><em> Galilee.</em><em> </em><em>You’ll see him there like he </em><em>said</em><em>.’”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They went out and ran from the tomb because trembling and excitement gripped them. They didn’t talk to anybody because they were afraid.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Mk</strong><strong> </strong><strong>16:1-8</strong> <strong>Appearance to Mary the Magdalene</strong> [[<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>After he’d resurrected early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, that he’d cast seven demons out of. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>She reported it to the ones that had been with him, who were mourning and crying. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When they heard she’d seen him alive, they didn’t believe it.<strong>    </strong><strong>[Mk 16:9-11]</strong> <strong>Appearance to Two Disciples</strong><strong>	</strong> <strong>and to the Ten</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> After that, he appeared to two of them in a different form as they were walking<sup>p</sup> into <em>the</em> countryside. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They went back <em>to Jerusalem </em>to report it to the rest, <em>but</em> they didn’t believe them either. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Later, he appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at table and chided them for their resistance to believing the ones that had seen him resurrected.	                  [<strong>Mk 16:12-14]</strong> <strong>Appearance in Jerusalem</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He told them, <em>“Go all over the world and tell everybody the good news. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever disbelieves will be condemned. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>These</em><em> signs will follow the ones that believe: </em> <em>they’ll cast out demons in my name; </em> <em>they’ll speak in new languages; </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>they’ll</em><em> pick up snakes, and </em> <em>if they drink anything deadly, it won’t hurt them; </em> <em>they’ll lay hands on sick people</em><em>,</em><em> and they’ll recover.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>[Mk 16:15-18]</strong> <strong>The Ascension</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down on God’s right hand. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> disciples </em>went out and delivered the good news everywhere, and the Lord worked with them by confirming the message with the signs that followed.]]	 [<strong>Mk 16:19-20]</strong> Translator: Virgil Warren     								      christir.org</span>
