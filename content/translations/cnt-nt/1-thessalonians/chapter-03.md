## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When we couldn't contain our concern about you anymore, we decided to stay behind by ourselves in Athens 2and send Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the good news about Christ. He could strengthen and encourage you in your faith 3so the troubles you were facing wouldn't disturb any of you. You know we Christians are destined for opposition. 4Even when we were there, we kept telling you we'd run into trouble; and that's what happened. 5That's why I couldn't contain my concern for you anymore and sent to find out about your faith. I didn't want your tempter to somehow make our labor be for nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now Timothy has come back and brought us good news about your faith and love, that you have fond memories of us and want to see us like we want to see you. 7So your faithfulness is a relief to us during our own distress. 8Now we live if you stand firm in the Lord. 9How can we thank God for the joy you bring us? 10Day and night we sincerely pray to see you and to supply what your faith may lack.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> May God our Father and Jesus our Lord direct us back to you. 12May the Lord increase your love for one another and everybody else like we abound in love for you. 13May he make your hearts blameless in holiness in front of him when our Lord Jesus comes with his saints. Amen.</span>
