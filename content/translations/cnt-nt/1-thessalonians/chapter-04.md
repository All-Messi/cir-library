## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4

### Encouragement to Please God

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Finally, we urge you by the Lord Jesus to live the way you should—like you received from us—so you improve your living even more. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You know what commandments we gave you from the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>This is the will of God who sanctifies you: <em>that</em> you abstain from sexual immorality, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>that</em> each of you know how to exercise self-control in holiness and honor (<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>not <em>living</em> in lust like Gentiles, who don’t know God), <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>that</em> you not sin and cheat on your fellow Christian in such a matter. The Lord avenges things—like we warned <em>you</em>. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He didn’t call us to impurity, but to holiness. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So whoever rejects <em>that warning</em> isn’t rejecting us, but God, who puts his Holy Spirit in us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You don’t need <em>me</em> to write <em>to you </em>about brotherly love. God himself has taught you to love one another. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Indeed you do that to the <u>believers</u> throughout Macedonia. But we urge you to step it up <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and make it your ambition to live quietly, mind your own business, and work with your hands; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>so you’ll be living right toward <u>outsiders</u> and won’t need anything.<strong></span>

### Hope for the Dead


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> We want you to know about <em>Christians</em> that have died, so you won’t mourn like people without hope. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If we believe Jesus died and resurrected, we can also believe God will bring with Jesus the ones that have died in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> We tell you from the Lord that we who are still living when he comes back won’t have any advantage over the ones that have died. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>With the shout of the archangel and the trumpet of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ will resurrect first. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Then we who’re still living will go up with them in the clouds to meet him in the air; so we’ll always be with him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Console one another with that.</span>
