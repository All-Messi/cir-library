## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You also don't need me to write about when and under what circumstances he'll return. 2You know full well that the Lord will come like a thief at night. 3When people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them like birth pains on a woman; they won't escape. 4But you aren't in the dark, and that time won't overtake you like a thief. 5You're children of light and day, not of darkness and night. 6So don't sleep like other people; stay awake and be sober. 7People sleep at night and get drunk at night, 8but you must stay awake and sober. Put on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of hope for salvation. 9God didn't destine us to his fury, but to salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 10He died for us; so whether we're asleep or awake, we'll live with him. 11Comfort one another and keep building each other up like you're doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> We ask you to acknowledge the ones that labor among you, that have responsibility for you in the Lord and instruct you. 13For their work, regard them highly with love. Be at peace with each other. 14Warn the unruly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 15See that nobody repays evil for evil; follow what's good for one another and for all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Rejoice always, 17pray constantly, 18give thanks in everything. That's God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 19Don't quench the Spirit 20or disregard prophecies. 21Examine everything, hold onto what's good, 22abstain from evil in every way, shape, and form.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> May the God that brings peace make you completely holy and keep your spirit, soul, and body complete and blameless for when our Lord Jesus Christ returns. 24The One who's calling you is faithful and will do what he's promised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Pray for us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Greet all the fellow believers with a holy kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> By the Lord, I charge you to read this letter to the whole church.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with youpl.</span>
