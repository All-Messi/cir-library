## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

### The Manner of Christ’s Coming

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You also don’t need me to write <em>about</em> when and under what circumstances <em>he’ll return</em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You know full well that the Lord will come like a thief at night. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When people are saying, <em>“Peace and safety,”</em> destruction will come on them like birth pains on a woman; they won’t escape. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But <u>you</u> aren’t in the dark, and that time won’t overtake <u>you</u> like a thief. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You’re children of light and day, not of darkness and night. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So don’t sleep like other <em>people</em>; stay awake and be sober. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>People sleep at night and get drunk at night, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>but <u>you</u> must stay awake and sober. Put on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of hope for salvation. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>God didn’t destine us to <em>his </em>fury, but to salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He died for us; so whether we’re asleep or awake, we’ll live with him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Comfort one another and keep building each other up like you’re doing.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Th 5:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> We ask you to acknowledge the ones that labor among you, that have responsibility for you in the Lord and instruct you. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For their work, regard them highly with love. Be at peace with each other. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Warn the unruly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>See that nobody repays evil for evil; follow what’s good for one another and for all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Rejoice always, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>pray constantly, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>give thanks in everything. That’s God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Don’t quench the Spirit <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>or disregard prophecies. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Examine everything, hold onto what’s good, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>abstain from evil in every way, shape, and form.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Th 5:12-22</p>

### Concluding Encouragement


<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> May the God that brings peace make you completely holy and keep your spirit, soul, and body complete and blameless for when our Lord Jesus Christ returns. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The One who’s calling you <em>is</em> faithful and will do <em>what he’s promised.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Pray for us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Greet all the fellow believers with a holy kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> By the Lord, I charge you to read <em>this</em> letter to the whole church.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with you<sup>pl</sup>.</span>
