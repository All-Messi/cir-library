## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus ChristMessiah. Grace and peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> We are always grateful to God for you and include you in our prayers. We 3remember your work of faith, your labor of love, and your enduring hope that lies in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father. 4Family of Christ loved by God, we know you're chosen 5because our good news didn't come to you just in words, but in power, in the Holy Spirit, in complete confidence, like the kind of men you know we proved to be among you on your behalf. 6You imitated us and the Lord, because you received the message with the joy of the Holy Spirit among lots of difficulties. 7As a result, you became an example for the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 8The Lord's message rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but wherever your faith in God has gone. So we don't have to say anything. 9People acknowledge how you received us, how you turned from idols to serve the true, living God; 10how you wait for his Son from heaven—that God raised from the dead, Jesus who rescues us from the fury to come.</span>
