## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2

### Paul’s History with the Thessalonians

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Our coming to you proved to be productive. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As you know, after we’d suffered and been treated disgracefully, we gathered up the courage in our God to present his good news to you during our struggles. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We didn’t pressure <em>you</em> with deception, impure motives, or treachery. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But, we spoke the way we did since God approved us and entrusted <em>us</em> with the good news. <em>We were</em>n’t trying to please people, but God, who was approving our intentions. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>God <em>is</em> witness: we never stooped<sup> </sup>to flattery or veiled greed, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>or tried to get honor from you or anybody else. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Though as Christ’s apostles, we could’ve expected you to support us, we were gentle among you like a nurse taking care of her kids. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Since you became so dear to us, we enjoyed sharing with you God’s good news and our very selves. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>You remember our labor and hardship, how we worked day and night so we wouldn’t burden <em>you </em>while we presented his good news to you. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Along with God, you can confirm how devoutly, uprightly, blamelessly we carried ourselves among you—<strong><sup>11</sup></strong>like a father with his kids. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>We urged you, encouraged you, and testified to you to live worthy of the One that was calling you to his kingdom and honor.<strong></span>

### Their Openness to the Good News


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> That’s why we’re constantly grateful to God. When you heard his message, you accepted it, not as a human message, but as it really is, God’s message that’s at work in you. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>You followed the example of the churches of God in Christ: you suffered the same things from your countrymen that they did from the Jews—<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, drove us out, and haven’t been pleasing to God. They’ve been hostile to everybody <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and tried to keep us from speaking to Gentiles about salvation, always piling up their own sins. But fury will come on them in the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> We’ve been away from you for a little while—in person, not in heart. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>We’ve really wanted to see you, but Satan prevented it time and again. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Who is our hope, our joy, the crown we’ll be proud of when the Lord Jesus comes? Aren’t <u>you</u> our joy and honor?<strong> </strong><strong></span>
