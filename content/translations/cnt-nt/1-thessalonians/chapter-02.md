## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Our coming to you proved to be productive. 2As you know, after we'd suffered and been treated disgracefully, we gathered up the courage in our God to present his good news to you during our struggles. 3We didn't pressure you with deception, impure motives, or treachery. 4But, we spoke the way we did since God approved us and entrusted us with the good news. We weren't trying to please people, but God, who was approving our intentions. 5God is witness: we never stooped to flattery or veiled greed, 6or tried to get honor from you or anybody else. 7Though as Christ's apostles, we could've expected you to support us, we were gentle among you like a nurse taking care of her kids. 8Since you became so dear to us, we enjoyed sharing with you God's good news and our very selves. 9You remember our labor and hardship, how we worked day and night so we wouldn't burden you while we presented his good news to you. 10Along with God, you can confirm how devoutly, uprightly, blamelessly we carried ourselves among you—11like a father with his kids. 12We urged you, encouraged you, and testified to you to live worthy of the One that was calling you to his kingdom and honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> That's why we're constantly grateful to God. When you heard his message, you accepted it, not as a human message, but as it really is, God's message that's at work in you. 14You followed the example of the churches of God in Christ: you suffered the same things from your countrymen that they did from the Jews—15who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, drove us out, and haven't been pleasing to God. They've been hostile to everybody 16and tried to keep us from speaking to Gentiles about salvation, always piling up their own sins. But fury will come on them in the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> We've been away from you for a little while—in person, not in heart. 18We've really wanted to see you, but Satan prevented it time and again. 19Who is our hope, our joy, the crown we'll be proud of when the Lord Jesus comes? Aren't you our joy and honor?</span>
