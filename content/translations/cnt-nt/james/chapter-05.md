## James Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Come, come, rich people. Cry out loud over the miseries heading your way. 2Your wealth has decayed; your clothes are moth-eaten; 3your gold and silver have tarnished. Their tarnish will testify against you and consume you like fire. They're the 'wealth' you've laid up for your last days! 4You haven't paid the workers that mowed your fields. Their complaints have gone up to the Lord of hosts. 5You've lived in self-indulgence and luxury. You've fattened yourselves up at the expense of people you've ruined. 6You've condemned, you've murdered the Righteous One; he doesn't resist you. 	 James 5:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So be patient till the Lord comes. A farmer patiently waits for his valuable crop till it gets its early and late rains. 8You be patient too; strengthen your hearts because the Lord's coming soon. 9Don't complain about each other or you'll be complained about; the judge is standing right outside your doors. 10Take the LORD's prophets as models of suffering and endurance. 11We consider them blessed that endured. You've heard about Job's patience, and you know the Lord's compassionate and merciful in the end.        	 James 5:7-11</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Above all, don't swear by the sky, the earth, or anything else. Just say "yes" or "no"; otherwise, you fall under condemnation.  	 James 5:12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Is anybody suffering among you? He should pray. Is anybody happy? He should sing. 14Is anybody sick? He should call the church elders. They should pray over him and anoint him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15Prayer with faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, God will forgive them. 16Admit your sins to each other and pray for each other so you'll be healed. A good person's prayer can accomplish a lot. 17Elijah was a man like us, and he prayed sincerely that it wouldn't rain, and it didn't for three and a half years. 18He prayed again and it rained, and the ground grew its crops. 	    James 5:13-18</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Fellow believers, if somebody wanders off from the truth and somebody gets him turned around, 20he can be sure that returning a sinner from error will save him from death and cover a host of sins.    	  James 5:19-20</span>
