## James Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Come, come, rich people. Cry out loud over the miseries heading your way. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Your wealth has decayed; your clothes are moth-eaten; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>your gold and silver have tarnished. Their tarnish will testify against you and consume you like fire. They’re the ‘wealth’ you’ve laid up for your last days! <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>You haven’t paid the workers that mowed your fields. Their complaints have gone up to the Lord of hosts. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You’ve lived in self-indulgence and luxury. You’ve fattened yourselves up at the expense of people you’ve ruined. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>You’ve condemned, you’ve murdered the Righteous One; he doesn’t resist you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 5:1-6</p>

### Exhortation to Endurance


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So be patient till the Lord comes. A farmer patiently waits for his valuable crop till it gets <em>its</em> early and late rains. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>You be patient too; strengthen your hearts because the Lord’s coming soon. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Don’t complain about each other or you’ll be complained about; the judge is standing right outside your doors. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Take the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em>’s prophets as models of suffering and endurance. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>We consider them blessed that endured. You’ve heard about Job’s patience, and you know the Lord’s compassionate and merciful in the end.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 5:7-11</p>

### Dispensing with Oaths


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Above all, don’t swear by the sky, the earth, or anything else. Just say “yes” or “no”; otherwise, you fall under condemnation.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 5:12</p>

### Calling the Elders


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Is anybody suffering among you? He should pray. Is anybody happy? He should sing. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Is anybody sick? He should call the church elders. They should pray over him and anoint him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Prayer with faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, God will forgive them. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Admit your sins to each other and pray for each other so you’ll be healed. A good person’s prayer can accomplish a lot. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Elijah was a man like us, and he prayed sincerely that it wouldn’t rain, and it didn’t for three and a half years. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He prayed again and it rained, and the ground grew its crops.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Returning the Stray


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Fellow believers, if somebody wanders off from the truth and somebody gets him turned around, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>he can be sure that returning a sinner from error will save him from death and cover a host of sins.</span>
