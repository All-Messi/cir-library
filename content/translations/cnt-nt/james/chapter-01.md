## James Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> James, servant of God and the Lord Jesus ChristMessiah, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Consider temptation something to be glad about. 3It challenges your faith to produce stamina, 4and stamina gives you the ability to finish what you're doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> If you need wisdom, ask God. He gives it generously to everybody without blaming them for asking. 6Trust him when you ask. If you doubt, you're like an ocean wave blown around by the wind. 7Don't suppose you'll get anything from God. 8If you can't make up your mind, you're unsettled about everything you do.     	James 1:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Disciples in humble circumstances should take pride in their high position. 10Rich disciples should take pride in their humble circumstances because their wealth will fade away like a flower in the grass. 11The sun climbs high and joins the hot wind to dry up the grass and wilt the flowers, and their beauty fades away. That's how it is with rich people: they wither away in what they're trying to do.  	James 1:9-11</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When you hold up under temptation you're blessed. When approved, you'll receive life as a crown. That's what the Lord has promised people that care about him. 13When you face temptation, don't say, "God's tempting me." Evil isn't tempting to God, and he doesn't tempt anybody. 14Your own lusts are what tempt you, lure you away, entice you. 15When lust conceives, it bears sin, and sin grows up to produce death. 	James 1:12-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Don't get misled. 17Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father that enlightens us. There's no wavering or hint of inconsistency with him. 18He took the initiative in bringing us forth by the message about the truth so we've become a kind of firstfruits among people he created.  	 James 1:16-18</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Know this: people must be willing to listen, be careful about what they say, and be slow to get mad. 20People's anger doesn't produce God's goodness. 21So get rid of filthy ways of living and the excesses that evil brings; humbly yield to the implanted message that can save you.      	James 1:19-21</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Do the word; don't just listen to it and kid yourselves. 23If you hear it and don't do it, you're like a fellow that looks in a mirror 24and forgets what he looked like. 25When you stare into the perfect "law," the law of liberty, and continue as a doer, not just a hearer, you'll be blessed in what you do.   	   James 1:22-25</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> If you consider yourself religious but don't control your tongue, you're fooling yourself; your religion is useless. 27Pure, undefiled religion with God the Father is this: looking after orphans and widows in their hardship and keeping yourselves from getting stained by the world.         	James 1:26-27</span>
