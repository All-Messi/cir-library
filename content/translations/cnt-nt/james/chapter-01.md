## James Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>James, servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings. <strong>Temptation, Wisdom, Humility</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Consider temptation something to be glad about. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>It challenges your faith to produce stamina, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and stamina gives you the ability to finish what you’re doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>If you need wisdom, ask God. He gives it generously to everybody without blaming <em>the</em><em>m </em><em>for asking</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Trust him when you ask. If you doubt, you’re like an ocean wave blown around by the wind. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Don’t suppose you’ll get anything from God. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If you can’t make up your mind, you’re unsettled about everything you do.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 1:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Disciples in humble circumstances should take pride in their high position. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Rich disciples should take pride in their humble circumstances because their wealth will fade away like a flower in the grass. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The sun climbs high and joins the hot wind to dry up the grass and wilt the flowers, and their beauty fades away. That’s how it is with rich people: they wither away in what they’re trying to do.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 1:9-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>When you hold up under temptation you’re blessed. When approved, you’ll receive life as a crown. That’s what the Lord has promised people that care about him. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When you face temptation, don’t say, <em>“God’s tempting me.”</em><em> </em>Evil isn’t tempting to God, and he doesn’t tempt anybody. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Your own lusts are what tempt you, lure you away, entice you. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When lust conceives, it bears sin, and sin grows up to produce death.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 1:12-15</p>

### Listening, Doing, Controlling the Tongue


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Don’t get misled. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father that enlightens us. There’s no wavering or hint of inconsistency with him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He took the initiative in bringing us forth by the message about the truth so we’ve become a kind of firstfruits among people he created.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 1:16-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Know <em>this</em>: people must be willing to listen, be careful about what they say, and be slow to get mad. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>People’s anger doesn’t produce God’s goodness. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>So get rid of filthy ways of living and the excesses that evil brings; humbly yield to the implanted message that can save you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 1:19-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Do the word; don’t just listen to it and kid yourselves. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>If you hear <em>it</em> and don’t do <em>it</em>, you’re like a fellow that looks in a mirror <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and forgets what he looked like. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When you stare into the perfect “law,” the law of liberty, and continue as a doer, not just a hearer, you’ll be blessed in what you do.</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 1:22-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>If you consider yourself religious but don’t control your tongue, you’re fooling yourself; your religion is useless. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Pure, undefiled religion with God the Father is this: looking after orphans and widows in their hardship and keeping yourselves from getting stained by the world.</span>
