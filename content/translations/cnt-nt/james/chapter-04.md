## James Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Where do conflicts and disagreements come from? Don’t they come from pleasures at conflict inside you? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You want and don’t have, you kill and covet and can’t get, you quarrel and fight and don’t obtain because you don’t ask. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When you do ask, you don’t receive because you ask with the wrong motive: <em>you ask </em>so you can spend it on your pleasures. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Adulterers, you know, don’t you, that friendship with the world amounts to hostility toward God? So whoever wants to be friendly with the world makes himself hostile toward God. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Do you suppose the scripture says for no reason, <em>“The Spirit he put among us yearns to receive exclusive loyalty”?</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He gives more grace, <strong><em>“God resists the proud, but </em></strong><strong><em>he gives grace to the humble</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Pro</strong><strong> 3:34 LXX]</strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So submit to God. Resist the devil, and he’ll run from you. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Come close to God, and he’ll come close to you. Clean <em>your</em> hands, you sinners; purify <em>your</em> hearts, you with divided loyalties. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Be sad, mourn, and cry. Turn your laughing into mourning, and your lightheartedness into seriousness. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Humble yourselves in front of the Lord, and he’ll lift you up.</span>

### Ban on Criticism


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Don’t gossip about each other. When you criticize your brother or sister, you’re acting like a judge. If you do that, you go from being a doer of the law to serving as a judge for the law. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>There is one lawgiver and judge that can acquit or execute. Who are you to serve as a judge over your neighbor?</span>
<p class="section-ref">James 4:11-12</p>

### Recognizing Your Dependent Place


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Come, come, now, you that say, <em>“Today or tomorrow we’ll go to such and such a city, spend</em><em> a year, carry on business, </em><em>make money.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>You don’t know what tomorrow holds. What’s your life but a vapor that appears for a while and vanishes? <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>You should say, <em>“The Lord willing, we’ll live and do this or that.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But you take pride in your bragging; that’s not right. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>If you know to do good and don’t do it, you’re sinning.</span>
