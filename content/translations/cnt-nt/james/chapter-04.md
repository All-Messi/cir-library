## James Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Where do conflicts and disagreements come from? Don't they come from pleasures at conflict inside you? 2You want and don't have, you kill and covet and can't get, you quarrel and fight and don't obtain because you don't ask. 3When you do ask, you don't receive because you ask with the wrong motive: you ask so you can spend it on your pleasures. 4Adulterers, you know, don't you, that friendship with the world amounts to hostility toward God? So whoever wants to be friendly with the world makes himself hostile toward God. 5Do you suppose the scripture says for no reason, "The Spirit he put among us yearns to receive exclusive loyalty"? 6He gives more grace, "God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble" [Pro 3:34 LXX]. 7So submit to God. Resist the devil, and he'll run from you. 8Come close to God, and he'll come close to you. Clean your hands, you sinners; purify your hearts, you with divided loyalties. 9Be sad, mourn, and cry. Turn your laughing into mourning, and your lightheartedness into seriousness. 10Humble yourselves in front of the Lord, and he'll lift you up.   	 James 4:1-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Don't gossip about each other. When you criticize your brother or sister, you're acting like a judge. If you do that, you go from being a doer of the law to serving as a judge for the law. 12There is one lawgiver and judge that can acquit or execute. Who are you to serve as a judge over your neighbor?     	 James 4:11-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Come, come, now, you that say, "Today or tomorrow we'll go to such and such a city, spend a year, carry on business, make money." 14You don't know what tomorrow holds. What's your life but a vapor that appears for a while and vanishes? 15You should say, "The Lord willing, we'll live and do this or that." 16But you take pride in your bragging; that's not right. 17If you know to do good and don't do it, you're sinning.      	James 4:13-17</span>
