## James Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Not many of you should try to be teachers; you’ll get judged more strictly. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>In lots of ways we all slip up; if we don’t slip up in what we say, we’re perfect; and we can bridle our whole body. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We put bits in horses’ mouths so they’ll obey us, and we guide their whole body. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The same thing with ships. Though they’re so big and driven by strong winds, the helmsmen control them with a very small steering paddle wherever they want them to go. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The same thing with the tongue. It’s a small part of the body, but it makes big claims.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>A little spark can set a big forest on fire! <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>People tame all kinds of animals and birds, reptiles and sea creatures; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>but nobody can tame the tongue; <em>it’s</em> an uncontrollable evil full of deadly poison. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We bless the Lord and Father with it, and <em>then</em> curse people made like him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Blessing and cursing from the same mouth! That shouldn’t be. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Brackish and sweet water don’t gush out of the same spring, do they? <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>A fig tree can’t bear olives or a vine yield figs, can it? What’s salty can’t make something sweet.</span>

### The Importance of Wisdom


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Who’s wise and understanding among you? Show it in good, humble, wise living. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If you’re jealous and selfish, don’t act proud and lie <em>to cover it up</em>. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>“Wisdom” like that doesn’t come from above; it’s earthly, unspiritual, demonic. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Where there’s jealousy and selfishness, people are unstable and exhibit all kinds of bad behavior. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, open to reason, merciful, and yielding good fruits. It doesn’t waver or show hypocrisy. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Peacemakers use peace to plant righteous fruit.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></span>
