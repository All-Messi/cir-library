## James Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Not many of you should try to be teachers; you'll get judged more strictly. 2In lots of ways we all slip up; if we don't slip up in what we say, we're perfect; and we can bridle our whole body. 3We put bits in horses' mouths so they'll obey us, and we guide their whole body. 4The same thing with ships. Though they're so big and driven by strong winds, the helmsmen control them with a very small steering paddle wherever they want them to go. 5The same thing with the tongue. It's a small part of the body, but it makes big claims.	 James 3:1-5</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A little spark can set a big forest on fire! 7People tame all kinds of animals and birds, reptiles and sea creatures; 8but nobody can tame the tongue; it's an uncontrollable evil full of deadly poison. 9We bless the Lord and Father with it, and then curse people made like him. 10Blessing and cursing from the same mouth! That shouldn't be. 11Brackish and sweet water don't gush out of the same spring, do they? 12A fig tree can't bear olives or a vine yield figs, can it? What's salty can't make something sweet.  	 James 3:6-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Who's wise and understanding among you? Show it in good, humble, wise living. 14If you're jealous and selfish, don't act proud and lie to cover it up. 15"Wisdom" like that doesn't come from above; it's earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 16Where there's jealousy and selfishness, people are unstable and exhibit all kinds of bad behavior. 17Wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, open to reason, merciful, and yielding good fruits. It doesn't waver or show hypocrisy. 18Peacemakers use peace to plant righteous fruit.  	James 3:13-18</span>
