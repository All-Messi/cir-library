## James Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Fellow Christians, don’t discriminate against people while claiming to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>If a man comes into your assembly dressed nice with a gold ring on his finger, and a poor man comes in wearing shabby clothes, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and you give preference to the one in fine clothes and say, <em>“You sit here in a nice place,”</em> and you say to the poor man, <em>“You stand over there,”</em> or <em>“Sit </em><em>by</em><em> my footstool,”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>haven’t you discriminated and made judgments based on bad motives?<strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">James 2:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Listen, hasn’t God chosen poor people to be rich in faith and inherit the kingdom he promised to people that care about him? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But you’ve looked down on poor people. Don’t rich people bully you and take you to court? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Don’t they slander the good name you wear? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But, you do well to fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, <strong><em>“Love your neighbor as yourself</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Lev </strong><strong>19:18].</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>If you discriminate, you sin, and the Law convicts you of being a sinner. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one point, has become liable to the Law <em>as such</em>. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The One that said, <strong><em>“Do not commit adultery</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Ex 20:14; Deut</strong><strong> 5:18]</strong> is the same One that said, <strong><em>“Do not murder</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Ex 20:13; Deut</strong><strong> 5:17]</strong>. If you don’t commit adultery, but commit murder, you’re still a law breaker. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Speak and do like people that are evaluated by a “law” of liberty. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Condemnation is without mercy to the one that hasn’t shown mercy. Showing mercy is better than criticizing.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Doing vs. Believing


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> What good is it to say you believe but don’t do? Believing can’t save you, can it? <strong><sup>15</sup></strong> When a brother or sister needs clothes or daily food, what good is it <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>if somebody says, <em>“</em><em>Have a good day</em><em>; keep</em><em> warm and eat well</em><em>,”</em> but doesn’t give them what they need? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>It’s the same way if belief doesn’t do anything; it’s dead by itself.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">James 2:14-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Somebody might say, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> have belief; </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> have deeds.”</em> Show me your belief without doing anything, and I’ll show you my belief by what I do. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>You believe there’s one God; that’s nice. Demons believe <em>that</em> too—and tremble. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Can’t you see that believing without doing is useless? <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Wasn’t our ancestor Abraham justified by what he did when he sacrificed his son Isaac? <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Belief combined with his deeds; his deeds completed his belief. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He fulfilled the scripture that said, <strong><em>“Abraham believed God, and God considered him righteous”</em></strong> <strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 15:6]</strong>,<strong> </strong>and he was called “God’s friend” [<strong>2 Ch 20:7; Is</strong><strong> 41:8]</strong>. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>That shows we’re justified by what we do, not simply by what we believe. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The same with Rahab the prostitute; wasn’t she justified by what she did when she received the messengers and sent them out a different way? <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>As the body is dead if it doesn’t breathe, believing is dead if it doesn’t do anything.</span>
