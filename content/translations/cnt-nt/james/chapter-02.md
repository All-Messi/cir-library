## James Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Fellow Christians, don't discriminate against people while claiming to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. 2If a man comes into your assembly dressed nice with a gold ring on his finger, and a poor man comes in wearing shabby clothes, 3and you give preference to the one in fine clothes and say, "You sit here in a nice place," and you say to the poor man, "You stand over there," or "Sit by my footstool," 4haven't you discriminated and made judgments based on bad motives? 	James 2:1-4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Listen, hasn't God chosen poor people to be rich in faith and inherit the kingdom he promised to people that care about him? 6But you've looked down on poor people. Don't rich people bully you and take you to court? 7Don't they slander the good name you wear? 8But, you do well to fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself" [Lev 19:18]. 9If you discriminate, you sin, and the Law convicts you of being a sinner. 10Whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one point, has become liable to the Law as such. 11The One that said, "Do not commit adultery" [Ex 20:14; Deut 5:18] is the same One that said, "Do not murder" [Ex 20:13; Deut 5:17]. If you don't commit adultery, but commit murder, you're still a law breaker. 12Speak and do like people that are evaluated by a "law" of liberty. 13Condemnation is without mercy to the one that hasn't shown mercy. Showing mercy is better than criticizing. 	James 2:5-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> What good is it to say you believe but don't do? Believing can't save you, can it? 15 When a brother or sister needs clothes or daily food, what good is it 16if somebody says, "Have a good day; keep warm and eat well," but doesn't give them what they need? 17It's the same way if belief doesn't do anything; it's dead by itself. 	James 2:14-17</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Somebody might say, "You have belief; I have deeds." Show me your belief without doing anything, and I'll show you my belief by what I do. 19You believe there's one God; that's nice. Demons believe that too—and tremble. 20Can't you see that believing without doing is useless? 21Wasn't our ancestor Abraham justified by what he did when he sacrificed his son Isaac? 22Belief combined with his deeds; his deeds completed his belief. 23He fulfilled the scripture that said, "Abraham believed God, and God considered him righteous" [Gen 15:6], and he was called "God's friend" [2 Ch 20:7; Is 41:8]. 24That shows we're justified by what we do, not simply by what we believe. 25The same with Rahab the prostitute; wasn't she justified by what she did when she received the messengers and sent them out a different way? 26As the body is dead if it doesn't breathe, believing is dead if it doesn't do anything.  	 James 2:18-26</span>
