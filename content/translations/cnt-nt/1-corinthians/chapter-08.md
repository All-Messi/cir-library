## 1 Corinthians Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About things offered to idols. We all have knowledge. Knowledge tends to make a person proud; love builds other people up. 2If anybody thinks he knows, he doesn't know like he should. 3If anybody loves God, God knows it. 4So, as to eating things offered to idols, we know idols aren't real and there's no God but one. 5There are lots of so-called gods and lords in the sky and on earth. 6But for us</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But not everybody knows that. Some people were used to idols before. They were used to eating food as an offering to them. Eating that kind of food grates on their conscience now. Their conscience is weak, and it bothers them. 8Food doesn't make us acceptable to God: if we don't eat, we're not worse; if we do, we're not better. 9But be careful that yourpl freedom doesn't make weak people stumble. 10If someone sees youpl that have knowledge reclining at table in an idol's temple, won't their weak conscience be inclined to eat to the idol the things offered to the idol? 11Yourpl knowledge is destroying a weak Christian Christ died for. 12When you sin that way against members of Christ's body and grate on their tender conscience, you'repl sinning against Christ. 13So if what I eat makes my fellow Christians stumble, I'll never eat meat because I don't want to make them stumble.</span>
