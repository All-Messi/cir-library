## 1 Corinthians Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>About things offered to idols. We all have knowledge. Knowledge tends to make a person proud; love builds other people up. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>If anybody thinks he knows, he doesn’t know like he should. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>If anybody loves God, God knows it. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So, as to eating things offered to idols, we know idols aren’t real and there’s no God but one. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>There are lots of so-called gods and lords in the sky and on earth. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But for us there’s one God, the Father— <u>from</u> whom everything <em>has come</em> and <u>for</u> whom we <em>live</em>—and there’s one Lord, Jesus Christ— <u>by</u> whom everything <em>has come </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em>and <u>by</u> whom we <em>live</em>.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 8:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>But not everybody knows that. Some people were used to idols before. <em>They</em> <em>were used</em> to eating food as an offering to them. Eating that kind of food grates on their conscience now. Their conscience is weak, and it bothers them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Food doesn’t make us acceptable to God: if we don’t eat, we’re not worse; if we do, we’re not better. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But be careful that your<sup>pl</sup> freedom doesn’t make weak people stumble. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>If someone sees you<sup>pl</sup> that have knowledge reclining at table in an idol’s temple, won’t their weak conscience be inclined to eat to <em>the</em> <em>idol</em> the things offered to the idol? <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Your<sup>pl</sup> knowledge is destroying a weak Christian Christ died for. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When you sin that way against members of Christ’s body and grate on their tender conscience, you’re<sup>pl</sup> sinning against Christ. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>So if what I eat makes my fellow Christians stumble, I’ll <u>never</u> eat meat because I don’t want to make them stumble.</span>
