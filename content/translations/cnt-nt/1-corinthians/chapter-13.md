## 1 Corinthians Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If I speak in the languages of humans and angels, but don't love, like a noisy gong or crashing cymbal I mean nothing. 2If I prophesy, understand all mysteries, know everything, have enough faith to move mountains, but don't love, I am nothing. 3If I give everything I own to feed the poor and deliver my body to be burned up, but don't love, I gain nothing by doing it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Love is patient and kind, not jealous or proud. 5It's considerate, not selfish or easily offended; it doesn't dwell on what's wrong. 6Love doesn't enjoy doing people in; it enjoys the truth. 7Love bears up under everything; it tends to trust; it hopes for the best. Love lasts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Love never falls out of the picture. But prophesying will pass away; languages will stop; knowledge will disappear. 9We know partially and prophecy partially. 10But, when what's final comes, what's preliminary will disappear. 11When I was a kid, I talked like one, thought like one, reasoned like one. When I grew up, I quit doing what a kid does. 12We see in a mirror blurry now, but we'll see directly then. I know partly now, but then I'll know as I'm known. 13There's faith, hope, and love now—those three; but love is the most important.</span>
