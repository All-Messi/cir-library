## 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I want you to know that our forefathers passed through the sea under the cloud. 2They were baptized to Moses in the cloud and sea. 3They ate the same spiritual food 4and drank the same spiritual drink: they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them—the ChristMessiah. 5But God wasn't pleased with most of them and struck them down in the wilderness. 6What happened with them serves as an example for us not to crave evil things like they did, 7or worship idols like some of them did, "The people sat down to gluttony and got up to revelry" [Ex 32:6]. 8We must not commit sexual sin like some of them did, and 23,000 fell in one day. 9Let's not put Christ to trial like some of them did, and snakes killed them; 10or complain like some of them did, and the destroyer destroyed them. 11Scripture recorded those events to warn us later 12so whoever thinks he's standing would be careful not to fall. 13You haven't faced anything beyond normal human experience. God's reliable; he won't let you face more than you can handle. He'll provide an escape so you can handle it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So run away from idolatry. 15I'm talking to you as intelligent people; pay attention to what I'm saying. 16Isn't the cup of blessing that we bless, a sharing in Christ's blood? Isn't the loaf we break a participation in his body? 17Since there's one loaf, the many of us are one body and share the one loaf. 18Look at physical Israel. Don't the ones that eat the sacrifices share in the altar? 19So am I saying that something offered to an idol has value or that an idol has any value? 20No, I'm saying that what people sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, not God. And I don't want you involved with demons. 21You can't drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't participate in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 22Are we trying to make the Lord jealous? We aren't stronger than he is, are we?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Not everything that's possible is beneficial. 24Don't look after your own welfare as much as others' welfare. 25Eat whatever they sell in the marketplace; don't ask any questions for conscience sake, 26because, "The earth and everything in it belong to the LORD" [Ps 24:1; 50:12; 89:11, 27]. 27If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat anything he sets in front of you without asking any questions for conscience sake. 28But if somebody says, "This is offered in sacrifice," don't eat it 29out of consideration for the other person's conscience. Why does someone else's conscience limit my freedom? 30If I eat with thanks, why am I slandered for it? 31Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it to God's honor. 32Don't do anything that hurts Jews or Gentiles or God's church. 33I aim to be pleasing to everybody in everything I do. I don't try to do what's best for me, but for everybody's benefit so I can save them.</span>
