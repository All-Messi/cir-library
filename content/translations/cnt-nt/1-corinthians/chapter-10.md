## 1 Corinthians Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>I want you to know that our forefathers passed through the sea under the cloud. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They were baptized to Moses in the cloud and sea. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They ate the same spiritual food <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and drank the same spiritual drink: they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them—the Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But God wasn’t pleased with most of them and struck them down in the wilderness. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>What happened with them serves as an example for us not to crave evil things like they did, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>or worship idols like some of them did, <strong><em>“The people sat down to </em></strong><strong><em>gluttony</em></strong><strong><em> and got up to </em></strong><strong><em>revelry</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 32:6]</strong>. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> must not</em> commit sexual sin like some of them did,</span>
<p class="section-ref">and 23</p>

### ,000 fell in one day. 9Let’s not put Christ to trial like some of them did, and snakes killed them; 10or complain like some of them did, and the destroyer destroyed them. 11Scripture recorded those events to warn us later 12so whoever thinks he’s standing would be careful not to fall. 13You haven’t faced anything beyond normal human experience. God’s reliable; he won’t let you face more than you can handle. He’ll provide an escape so you can handle it. 	 1 Cor 10:1-13


<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>I commend you for remembering me and maintaining the customs I passed on to you. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I want you to know that God is the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every husband, and a husband <em>is head</em> of a wife. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A man that prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>A woman that prays or prophesies bareheaded disgraces her head. It’s the same as shaving it. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>If a woman is bareheaded, she may as well be bald. If it’s shameful for a woman to cut her hair off, she should cover her head. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A man shouldn’t cover his head because he’s the image and delight of God. A wife is her husband’s delight. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Man didn’t come from woman, but woman from man. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Man wasn’t created for woman, but woman for man. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>So she should wear <em>a sign of</em> authority on her head because of the angels. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But, in the Lord a husband and wife exist as a combination. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>As woman <em>came </em>from man, man <em>comes</em> by woman, and everything <em>comes</em> from God. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Judge for yourselves: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God bareheaded? <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Doesn’t what’s natural teach you that long hair dishonors a man, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>but it honors a woman? Long hair serves as a covering for her. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>If someone wants to argue about it, <u>we</u> don’t have such a custom; neither do the churches of God.</span>

### The Lord’s Supper


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>So run away from idolatry. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>I’m talking to you as intelligent people; pay attention to what I’m saying. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Isn’t the cup of blessing that we bless, a sharing in Christ’s blood? Isn’t the loaf we break a participation in his body? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Since there’s one loaf, the many of us are one body and share the one loaf. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Look at physical Israel. Don’t the ones that eat the sacrifices share in the altar? <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>So am I saying that something offered to an idol has value or that an idol has any value? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>No</em>, <em>I’m saying </em>that what people sacrifice, <em>they sacrifice</em> to demons, not God. And I don’t want you involved with demons. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>You can’t drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t participate in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Are we trying to make the Lord jealous? We aren’t stronger than he is, are we?</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 10:14-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>In this <em>next</em> instruction, I’m <u>not</u> commending you, because your getting together doesn’t make things better but worse. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>To begin with, when you get together for church, I hear there are divisions among you, and I’m inclined to believe it. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Divisions even need to exist to show who are approved. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When you get together, you can’t be eating the Lord’s Supper. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Each one is bringing out his own supper, and one’s hungry while another overeats. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Don’t you have houses to eat in? Do you disrespect God’s church and embarrass people that don’t have <em>anything to eat</em>? What can I say to you? Can I compliment you? Not for that, I can’t.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 11:17-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I received from the Lord what I passed on to <em>you</em>. The night he was betrayed, he took a loaf, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>gave thanks, broke it, and said, <em>“This is my body, </em><em>which is for you. Do this in</em> <em>memory</em><em> of me</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>After the meal <em>he took</em> the cup, <em>“This cup is the New Covenant in my blood.</em><em> </em><em>As often as you drink it, do it in memory</em><em> of me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you’re expressing the Lord’s death till he comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>So whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that’s not appropriate, is guilty of his body and blood. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>That’s why you need to examine yourself and eat the bread and drink the cup that way. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>If you eat and drink without recognizing the [Lord’s]<sup>ms</sup> body, you eat and drink condemnation to yourself. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>That’s why many of you are weak and sickly, and a considerable <em>number</em> are dying. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>If we examine ourselves, we won’t be condemned. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>When we judge ourselves, the Lord disciplines us so we won’t be condemned along with the world. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>So when you get together to eat, be considerate. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>If you’re hungry, eat at home to avoid being condemned. I’ll straighten out the rest when I get there.</span>
