## 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

### Boundaries of Christian Liberty

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I want you to know that our forefathers passed through the sea under the cloud. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They were baptized to Moses in the cloud and sea. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They ate the same spiritual food <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and drank the same spiritual drink: they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them—the Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But God wasn’t pleased with most of them and struck them down in the wilderness. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>What happened with them serves as an example for us not to crave evil things like they did, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>or worship idols like some of them did, <strong><em>“The people sat down to </em></strong><strong><em>gluttony</em></strong><strong><em> and got up to </em></strong><strong><em>revelry</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 32:6]</strong>. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> must not</em> commit sexual sin like some of them did, and 23,000 fell in one day. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Let’s not put Christ to trial like some of them did, and snakes killed them; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>or complain like some of them did, and the destroyer destroyed them. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Scripture recorded those events to warn us later <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>so whoever thinks he’s standing would be careful not to fall. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>You haven’t faced anything beyond normal human experience. God’s reliable; he won’t let you face more than you can handle. He’ll provide an escape so you can handle it.<strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So run away from idolatry. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>I’m talking to you as intelligent people; pay attention to what I’m saying. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Isn’t the cup of blessing that we bless, a sharing in Christ’s blood? Isn’t the loaf we break a participation in his body? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Since there’s one loaf, the many of us are one body and share the one loaf. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Look at physical Israel. Don’t the ones that eat the sacrifices share in the altar? <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>So am I saying that something offered to an idol has value or that an idol has any value? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>No</em>, <em>I’m saying </em>that what people sacrifice, <em>they sacrifice</em> to demons, not God. And I don’t want you involved with demons. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>You can’t drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t participate in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Are we trying to make the Lord jealous? We aren’t stronger than he is, are we?</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 10:14-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I received from the Lord what I passed on to <em>you</em>. The night he was betrayed, he took a loaf, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>gave thanks, broke it, and said, <em>“This is my body, </em><em>which is for you. Do this in</em> <em>memory</em><em> of me</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>After the meal <em>he took</em> the cup, <em>“This cup is the New Covenant in my blood.</em><em> </em><em>As often as you drink it, do it in memory</em><em> of me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you’re expressing the Lord’s death till he comes.</span>
