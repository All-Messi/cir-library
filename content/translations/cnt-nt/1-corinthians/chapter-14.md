## 1 Corinthians Chapter 14

### 13:13 How Speaking in Languages Works

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong> Cor 14:20-25</strong> 	<strong>Orderly Assembly</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> If I come to you speaking in <em>other</em> languages, how will I be helping you unless I’m giving revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Even inanimate things that make sounds—like flutes or harps—if they don’t make definite tones, how will listeners recognize what the flute or harp is playing? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If a bugle makes random sounds, who’s going to arm for battle? <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>In the same way, unless you speak clearly in a language, how are people going to understand you? You’ll be talking into the air. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>There are lots of <em>language</em><em>s</em> in the world, and they all convey meaning. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>If I don’t understand what the sound means, we’re foreigners to each other. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So since you’re enthused about spiritual <em>gifts</em>, aim at helping the church <em>with them</em>. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Whoever speaks in <em>another</em> language should pray to be able to translate it. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If I’m praying in <em>another</em> language, my spirit’s praying, but my mind isn’t understanding the words I’m saying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> What, then? I’ll pray with the spirit <u>and</u> the mind. I’ll sing with the spirit <u>and</u> the mind. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Otherwise, if I’m blessing with the spirit, how can the ungifted say, <em>“Amen</em>,<em>”</em> when I give thanks? He won’t be understanding me. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>I’ll be giving thanks all right, but I won’t be helping <u>him</u>. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I thank God that I speak in <em>other </em>languages more than all of you do, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>but in church I’d rather say five words with my mind so I can teach other people than 10,000 words in <em>another</em> language.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 14:15-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Don’t think like little kids. (Be <em>innocent </em>like little kids when it comes to evil.) In your minds, be grown-ups. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Law says, 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>“‘</em></strong><strong><em>I’</em></strong><strong><em>ll speak to this people</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> 	<strong><em>in foreign language</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>with</em></strong><strong><em> the lips of </em></strong><strong><em>foreigner</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>they </em></strong><strong><em>won’t </em></strong><strong><em>listen to </em></strong><em>me </em><strong><em>even</em></strong><em> that way,’ the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says”</em> <strong>[Is 28:11; Deut</strong><strong> 28:49]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So <em>other </em>languages serve as signs for unbelievers, <em>more than</em> believers; prophecy is for believers, <em>more than</em> unbelievers. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>If the church gets together, and everybody is speaking in <em>other</em> languages, and ungifted or unbelievers come in, won’t they say you’re out of your mind? <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But if everybody’s speaking on behalf of <em>God</em> and unbelievers or laymen come in, you’ll be convicting them and calling them to account. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Their inner yearnings will become clear, and they’ll fall on their faces and worship God. They’ll declare, <em>“God </em><em><u>has</u></em><em> to be</em><em> among you.”</em><em>   </em><em>	  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> What, then? When you get together, and each has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a language, a translation, do everything to benefit <em>one another</em>. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>If people speak in <em>another</em> language, two or at most three should take turns, and one should translate. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>If there’s no translator, they need to be quiet and talk to themselves and to God. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Two or three prophets can speak, and the others think about <em>what they’re saying</em>. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>If a revelation comes to somebody else that’s sitting <em>there</em>, the first should yield the floor. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>You can all take turns prophesying so everybody can learn and be encouraged. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>The spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets; <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>God brings peace, not confusion.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 14:26-33</p>

### a  	Women’s Decorum in Church As in all the churches of the saints, 34women should remain silent in church services and practice deference like the Law says. 35If they want to find out about something, they can ask their husbands at home; it’s embarrassing for a woman to speak out in church. 36Did the word of God come from you, or did it come just to you?


<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> If you consider <em>yourself</em> a prophet or spiritual person, you need to recognize that what I’m writing to you is the Lord’s command. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>If anyone ignores <em>that</em>, ignore them. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>So, <em>go ahead and</em> earnestly desire to prophesy and let people speak in <em>other </em>languages, <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>but do everything properly and orderly.</span>
