## 1 Corinthians Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Focus on practicing love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts so you can communicate. 2A person that's speaking in another language isn't speaking to anybody but God because nobody is understanding what the Spirit is enabling him to say. 3A person that communicates, helps, encourages, comforts other people. 4Somebody that speaks in another language helps himself, but a person that communicates helps the church. 5Now I'm willing for all of you to speak in languages, but so you can communicate. If you communicate, you're doing something more important than speaking in other languages—unless you translate so you can help the church.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> If I come to you speaking in other languages, how will I be helping you unless I'm giving revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching? 7Even inanimate things that make sounds—like flutes or harps—if they don't make definite tones, how will listeners recognize what the flute or harp is playing? 8If a bugle makes random sounds, who's going to arm for battle? 9In the same way, unless you speak clearly in a language, how are people going to understand you? You'll be talking into the air. 10There are lots of languages in the world, and they all convey meaning. 11If I don't understand what the sound means, we're foreigners to each other. 12So since you're enthused about spiritual gifts, aim at helping the church with them. 13Whoever speaks in another language should pray to be able to translate it. 14If I'm praying in another language, my spirit's praying, but my mind isn't understanding the words I'm saying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> What, then? I'll pray with the spirit and the mind. I'll sing with the spirit and the mind. 16Otherwise, if I'm blessing with the spirit, how can the ungifted say, "Amen," when I give thanks? He won't be understanding me. 17I'll be giving thanks all right, but I won't be helping him. 18I thank God that I speak in other languages more than all of you do, 19but in church I'd rather say five words with my mind so I can teach other people than 10,000 words in another language.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Don't think like little kids. (Be innocent like little kids when it comes to evil.) In your minds, be grown-ups. 21The Law says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So other languages serve as signs for unbelievers, more than believers; prophecy is for believers, more than unbelievers. 23If the church gets together, and everybody is speaking in other languages, and ungifted or unbelievers come in, won't they say you're out of your mind? 24But if everybody's speaking on behalf of God and unbelievers or laymen come in, you'll be convicting them and calling them to account. 25Their inner yearnings will become clear, and they'll fall on their faces and worship God. They'll declare, "God has to be among you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> What, then? When you get together, and each has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a language, a translation, do everything to benefit one another. 27If people speak in another language, two or at most three should take turns, and one should translate. 28If there's no translator, they need to be quiet and talk to themselves and to God. 29Two or three prophets can speak, and the others think about what they're saying. 30If a revelation comes to somebody else that's sitting there, the first should yield the floor. 31You can all take turns prophesying so everybody can learn and be encouraged. 32The spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets; 33God brings peace, not confusion.	 1 Cor 14:26-33a As in all the churches of the saints, 34women should remain silent in church services and practice deference like the Law says. 35If they want to find out about something, they can ask their husbands at home; it's embarrassing for a woman to speak out in church. 36Did the word of God come from you, or did it come just to you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> If you consider yourself a prophet or spiritual person, you need to recognize that what I'm writing to you is the Lord's command. 38If anyone ignores that, ignore them. 39So, go ahead and earnestly desire to prophesy and let people speak in other languages, 40but do everything properly and orderly.  	  1 Cor 14:33b-40</span>
