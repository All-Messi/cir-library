## 1 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Members of Christ's family, I couldn't talk to you like spiritual people, but like material-minded ones, like infants in Christ. 2I gave you milk, not solid food. You couldn't eat solid food and still can't. 3You're still material minded. While jealousy and conflict exist among you, aren't you material minded and act like typical people? 4When any of you says, "I'm with Paul," "I'm with Apollos," aren't you material minded and act like typical people? 5What's Apollos? What's Paul? Ministers that led you to faith. 6I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow. 7So the one that plants or waters isn't important, but God who makes it grow. 8The one that plants and the one that waters combine their efforts, and God will pay each one for his own work. 9We're God's fellow workers; you're his field, his building.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> By God's grace, like a skilled general contractor, I've laid a foundation, and others are building on it. They need to be careful how they do that. 11Nobody can lay any other foundation than the One I've laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12If yousg build on it with gold, silver, precious stones—wood, hay, straw, 13time will tell how good your work proves to be; fire will test it and make that obvious. 14If yoursg work lasts, you'll get paid. 15If it burns up, you'll take a loss, but you'll be saved—but as through fire. 16Don't youpl know you'repl God's temple, and God's Spirit lives in youpl? 17If yousg destroy his temple, he'll destroy yousg. His temple is holy; that's what youpl are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Don't kid yourselves. If any of you think you're wise in the world, you need to become "foolish" to become wise. 19The world's wisdom amounts to foolishness as far as God's concerned. Scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So, don't anyone take pride in other people. Everything belongs to you: 22Paul, Apollos, Cephas; the world, life, death; things present, things to come. They're all yours, 23you're Christ's, and Christ is God's.</span>
