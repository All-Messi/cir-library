## 1 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Members of Christ’s family, I couldn’t talk to you like spiritual people, but like material-minded ones, like infants in Christ. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I gave you milk, not solid food. You couldn’t <em>eat </em><em>solid food</em> and still can’t. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You’re still material minded. While jealousy and conflict <em>exist</em> among you, aren’t you material minded and act like typical people? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When any of you says, <em>“</em><em><u>I</u></em><em><u>’m</u></em><em> with Paul</em><em>,</em><em>”</em> <em>“</em><em><u>I’m</u></em><em> with Apollos,”</em> aren’t you material minded and act like typical people? <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>What’s Apollos? What’s Paul? Ministers that led you to faith. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So the one that plants or waters isn’t important, but God who makes it grow. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The one that plants and the one that waters combine their efforts, and God will pay each one for his own work. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We’re God’s fellow workers; you’re his field, his building.</span>

### Christians as God’s Temple


<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>By God’s grace, like a skilled general contractor, I’ve laid a foundation, and others are building on it. They need to be careful how they do that. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Nobody can lay any other foundation than the One I’ve laid, which is Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>If you<sup>sg</sup> build on it with gold, silver, precious stones—wood, hay, straw, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>time will tell how good your work proves to be; fire will test it and make that obvious. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If your<sup>sg</sup> work lasts, you’ll get paid. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If it burns up, you’ll take a loss, but <u>you</u>’ll be saved—but as through fire. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Don’t you<sup>pl</sup> know you’re<sup>pl</sup> God’s temple, and God’s Spirit lives in you<sup>pl</sup>? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>If you<sup>sg</sup> destroy his temple, he’ll destroy <u>you</u><sup>sg.</sup> His temple is holy; that’s what you<sup>pl</sup> are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Don’t kid yourselves. If any of you think you’re wise in the world, you need to become “foolish” to become wise. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The world’s wisdom amounts to foolishness as far as God’s concerned. Scripture says, <strong><em>“He </em></strong><strong><em>traps</em></strong><strong><em> the </em></strong><strong><em>crafty</em></strong><strong><em> in the</em></strong><strong><em>ir craftiness</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[</strong><strong>Job 5:13</strong><strong>]</strong><strong><em>;</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> and, <strong><em>“The </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> knows that the </em></strong><strong><em>speculations</em></strong><strong><em> of the wise </em></strong><strong><em>are meaningless”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 94:11]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So, don’t anyone take pride in other people. Everything belongs to you: <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Paul, Apollos, Cephas; the world, life, death; things present, things to come. <em>They’re</em> all yours, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>you’re Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</span>
