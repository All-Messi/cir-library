## 1 Corinthians Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About spiritual gifts. 2You know that when you were pagans, in one way or another, idols that couldn't talk were leading you astray. 3So I tell you, nobody that speaks by God's Spirit claims, "Jesus is accursed"; and nobody can claim, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> There's a variety of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit; 5a variety of ministries, but the same Lord; 6a variety of activities, but the same God, who accomplishes everything in everyone. 7The demonstration each person has from the Spirit serves for the benefit of the rest. 8The same Spirit gives a message about wise living to one and a message about understanding to another, 9faith to one and gifts of healing to another; 10working miracles to one, prophesying to another, and distinguishing between spirits to another; speaking different languages to one and translating languages to another. 11The same Spirit does them all and distributes to each person as he sees fit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> As one body has many parts, so does Christ. 13We were baptized in one Spirit into one body—whether Jew or Greek, bond or free—and drank from one Spirit. 14The body doesn't have one part, but many. 15If a foot says, "Since I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body," is it then not part of the body? 16If an ear says, "Since I'm not an eye, I'm not part of the body," is it then not part of the body? 17If the whole body were an eye, how would it hear anything? If the whole body were hearing, where would it smell anything? 18God has placed each part in the body just the way he wants it. 19If they were all one part, where would the whole body be? 20There are many parts, but one body. 21An eye can't tell a hand, "I don't need you." The head can't tell the feet, "I don't need you." 22More notably yet, parts we consider weaker are necessary. 23Parts we consider less honorable we give more attention to; our less presentable parts become more presentable, 24and parts that are already presentable get less attention. God has put the body together in a way that gives greater honor to the part that lacks it, 25so there's no division in the body because the parts take care of each another. 26If one part suffers, they all suffer; if one receives honor, they all rejoice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> As a group you're Christ's body, and individually you're parts of it. 28In the church, God has appointed apostles first, prophets second, teachers third, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of languages. 29Not everyone is an apostle or prophet or teacher or miracle worker, are they? 30Not everyone has gifts for healing or speaks in languages or translates, do they?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Earnestly desire the more important gifts, but I'll show you something even better.</span>
