## 1 Corinthians Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About spiritual <em>gifts</em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You know that when you were pagans, in one way or another, idols that couldn’t talk were leading you astray. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So I tell you, nobody that speaks by God’s Spirit claims, <em>“Jesus is accursed”</em>; and nobody can claim, <em>“Jesus is Lord,”</em> except by the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Love is patient and kind, not jealous or proud. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>It’s considerate, not selfish or easily offended; it doesn’t dwell on what’s wrong. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Love doesn’t enjoy doing people in; it enjoys the truth. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Love bears up under everything; it tends to trust; it hopes for the best. Love lasts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> As one body has many parts, so does Christ. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>We were baptized in one Spirit into one body—whether Jew or Greek, bond or free—and drank from one Spirit. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The body doesn’t have one part, but many. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If a foot says, <em>“Since I’m not a hand, I’m not part of the body,”</em> is it then not part of the body? <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>If an ear says, <em>“Since I’m not an eye, I’m not part of the body,” </em>is it then not part of the body? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>If the whole body <em>were an</em> eye, how would it hear anything? If the whole body <em>were </em>hearing, where <em>would</em><em> </em>it smell anything? <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>God has placed each part in the body just the way he wants it. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>If they were all one part, where <em>would</em> the <em>whole</em> body <em>be</em>? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>There are many parts, but one body. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>An eye can’t tell a hand, <em>“I don’t need you</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> The head can’t tell the feet, <em>“I don’t need you.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>More notably yet, parts we consider weaker are necessary. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Parts we consider less honorable we give more attention to; our less presentable parts become more presentable, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and parts that are already presentable get less attention. God has put the body together in a way that gives greater honor to the part that lacks <em>it</em>, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>so there’s no division in the body because the parts take care of each another. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>If one part suffers, they all suffer; if one receives honor, they all rejoice.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 12:12-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> <em>As</em><em> a group</em> you’re Christ’s body, and individually <em>you’re</em> parts <em>of it</em>. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>In the church, God has appointed apostles first, prophets second, teachers third, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of languages. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Not everyone is an apostle or prophet or teacher or miracle worker, are they? <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Not everyone has gifts for healing or speaks in languages or translates, do they?</span>

### Love , the All-Purpose Virtue


<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Earnestly desire the more important gifts, but I’ll show you something <em>even</em> better. <strong>13</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>If I speak in the languages of humans and angels, but don’t love, like a noisy gong or crashing cymbal <u>I</u><em><u> mean nothing</u></em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>If I prophesy, understand all mysteries, know everything, have enough faith to move mountains, but don’t love, <u>I am nothing</u>. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>If I give everything I own to feed <em>the poor</em> and deliver my body to be burned up, but don’t love, <u>I gain nothing</u> <em>by doing it.</em></span>
