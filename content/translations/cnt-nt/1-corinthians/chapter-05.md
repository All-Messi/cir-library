## 1 Corinthians Chapter 5

### Immorality in Corinth

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Immorality is reported among you that doesn’t exist even among Gentiles—someone living with his father’s wife. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Are you proud <em>of this</em> instead of mourning <em>over it</em>—a mourning that should lead to removing him from you? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I’m absent in body but present in spirit, and already—as if present—I’ve judged him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>In the name of our Lord Jesus, assemble with my spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and deliver him to Satan to destroy the flesh but save his spirit when the Lord comes. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Your pride is not good. Don’t you understand that a little yeast spreads through the whole batch? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Get rid of the old yeast so you’re a fresh batch. You’re a fresh <em>batch</em> because Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So let’s celebrate the feast, not with old, evil yeast, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I’ve written to you not to associate with immoral people. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> </em>don’t <em>mean</em> immoral people <u>in the</u><u> world</u>—covetous people, swindlers, idolaters. You’d have to get out of the world <em>to do that</em><em>!</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Now I’m writing to you not to associate with anyone called a <u>Christian</u> that’s immoral or covetous, an idolater, slanderer, or drunk—not to eat with someone like that<em>. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>What business is it of mine to judge people outside <em>the church</em>? Isn’t it your responsibility to judge the ones in <em>the</em> <em>church</em>? <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>God will judge the rest. <strong><em>“Remove the </em></strong><strong><em>sinful person from you</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Deut 17:7; 19:19; 22:21, 24; 24:7]</strong>.<strong></span>
