## 1 Corinthians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Immorality is reported among you that doesn't exist even among Gentiles—someone living with his father's wife. 2Are you proud of this instead of mourning over it—a mourning that should lead to removing him from you? 3I'm absent in body but present in spirit, and already—as if present—I've judged him. 4In the name of our Lord Jesus, assemble with my spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 5and deliver him to Satan to destroy the flesh but save his spirit when the Lord comes. 6Your pride is not good. Don't you understand that a little yeast spreads through the whole batch? 7Get rid of the old yeast so you're a fresh batch. You're a fresh batch because Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. 8So let's celebrate the feast, not with old, evil yeast, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I've written to you not to associate with immoral people. 10I don't mean immoral people in the world—covetous people, swindlers, idolaters. You'd have to get out of the world to do that! 11Now I'm writing to you not to associate with anyone called a Christian that's immoral or covetous, an idolater, slanderer, or drunk—not to eat with someone like that. 12What business is it of mine to judge people outside the church? Isn't it your responsibility to judge the ones in the church? 13God will judge the rest. "Remove the sinful person from you" [Deut 17:7; 19:19; 22:21, 24; 24:7].</span>
