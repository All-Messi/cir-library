## 1 Corinthians Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Regarding the things you wrote about. It's okay for a man to stay single. 2But, to avoid sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. 3A husband needs to give his wife what's due her, and vice versa. 4A wife doesn't have sole rights over her own body; her husband does too. The same for a husband. 5Don't withhold yourself from one another except for a while by agreement to devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6I say that as a concession, not a commandment. 7I'd like everyone to be like me, but each person has his gift from God—one, one way; another, another way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I say to unmarried people and widows, it's good to stay like me. 9But if you don't have self-control, get married; it's better to marry than to lust. 10But the Lord, not just me, instructs a wife not to divorce her husband—11if she does divorce him, she needs to stay single or be reconciled to him—and a husband not to leave his wife. 12To the rest I say, not the Lord, if a disciple has an unbelieving wife and she's willing to keep living with him, he shouldn't leave her. 13If a wife has an unbelieving husband and he's perfectly content to keep living with her, she shouldn't leave him. 14A believing wife legitimizes an unbelieving husband and vice versa; otherwise, your children would be illegitimate. 15If an unbelieving spouse does divorce, let him or her divorce. A brother or sister isn't bound in such cases. God has called us in peace. 16How do you know, wife, that perhaps you'll save your husband; or husband, that you'll save your wife?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Keep living in the societal circumstance where God called you. That's what I tell everybody in all the churches. 18Were you called as circumcised? You don't need to get uncircumcised. Were you called as uncircumcised? You don't need to get circumcised. 19Circumcision or uncircumcision doesn't matter. Keeping God's commandments is what matters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Keep living in the circumstance where God called you. 21Were you called as a slave? It doesn't matter. (But, if you can be free, do it.) 22A person the Lord calls that's a servant is free as far as he is concerned. A person the Lord calls tthat's a freeman is the Lord's 'servant.' 23You've been purchased for a price; don't become servants to other people. 24Stay with God in the circumstance where he called you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> About virgins. I don't have any command from the Lord, but I offer my opinion as somebody he has been merciful enough to consider dependable. 26I recommend handling the matter this way in light of present difficulties: it's good for you to stay the way you are. 27Are you married? Don't get a divorce. Are you single? Don't look for somebody to marry. 28If you do get married, you haven't sinned; if a virgin gets married, she hasn't sinned. But married people will face difficulties in this life, and I want to spare you. 29I'm telling you, it won't be long till the ones that have wives will be as if they didn't, 30those crying or rejoicing as if they weren't, 31and those taking advantage of this world's opportunities as not doing it fully. The situation's changing, 32and I don't want you to have distracting concerns. An unmarried man tends to concern himself with the Lord's things—how to please him; 33a married man feels a need to concern himself with this world's things—how to be pleasing to his wife 34and is torn. Unmarried women and virgins tend to be concerned about the Lord's things—being holy in body and spirit; a married woman feels a need to concern herself with this world's things—how to be pleasing to her husband. 35I'm saying this to help you, not to hold you back—to free you for orderly, undistracted devotion to the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> If a man thinks he's being insensitive toward his virgin daughter, if she's full-grown and wants to get married, he should follow his heart. He's not sinning; do what he's inclined to do; let them marry. 37But a man that's made up his mind, stands firm in his heart, is under no pressure, has decided as far as he's concerned to keep his virgin, he's doing a good thing. 38So, the one who gives his virgin daughter in marriage does well, and the one that doesn't does better.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> A wife is married to her husband for as long as he's alive. If he dies, she's free to marry whoever she wants to—only in the Lord. 40But she'd be happier if she stayed like she is, but that's just me. I think I also have God's Spirit.</span>
