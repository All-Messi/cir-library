### Teaching About Marriage

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Regarding the things you wrote about. It’s okay for a man to stay single. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But, to avoid sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A husband needs to give his wife what’s due her, and vice versa. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A wife doesn’t have <em>sole </em>rights over her own body; her husband <em>does too</em>. The same for a husband. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Don’t withhold yourself from one another except for a while by agreement to devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I say that as a concession, not a commandment. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I’d like everyone to be like me, but each person has his gift from God—one, one way; another, another way.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 7:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I say to unmarried people and widows, it’s good to stay like me. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But if you don’t have self-control, get married; it’s better to marry than to lust. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But the Lord, not <em>just </em>me, instructs a wife not to divorce her husband—<strong><sup>11</sup></strong>if she does divorce him, she needs to stay single or be reconciled to him—and a husband not to leave his wife. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>To the rest I say, not the Lord, if a disciple has an unbelieving wife and she’s willing to keep living with him, he shouldn’t leave her. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>If a wife has an unbelieving husband and he’s perfectly content to keep living with her, she shouldn’t leave him. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>A <em>believing</em> wife legitimizes an unbelieving husband and vice versa; otherwise, your children would be illegitimate. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If an unbelieving <em>spouse</em> does divorce, let <em>him</em> <em>or her </em>divorce. A brother or sister isn’t bound in such cases. God has called us in peace. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>How do you know, wife, that perhaps you’ll save <em>your</em> husband; or husband, that you’ll save <em>your</em> wife?</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 7:8-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Keep living in the <em>societal </em>circumstance where God called you. That’s what I tell everybody in all the churches. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Were you called as circumcised? You don’t need to get uncircumcised. Were you called as uncircumcised? You don’t need to get circumcised. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Circumcision or uncircumcision doesn’t matter. Keeping God’s commandments is what matters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Keep living in the circumstance where God called you. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Were you called as a slave? It doesn’t matter. (But, if you <u>can</u> be free, do it.) <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>A person the Lord calls that’s a servant is free as far as he is concerned. A person the Lord calls tthat’s a freeman is the Lord’s ‘servant.’ <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>You’ve been purchased for a price; don’t become servants to other people. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Stay with God in the circumstance where he called you.</span>

### Advice to the Unmarried


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> About virgins. I don’t have any command from the Lord, but I offer <em>my</em> opinion as somebody he has been merciful enough to consider dependable. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>I recommend handling the matter this way in light of present difficulties: it’s good for you to stay the way you are. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Are you married? Don’t get a divorce. Are you single? Don’t look for somebody to marry. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>If you do get married, you haven’t sinned; if a virgin gets married, she hasn’t sinned. But <em>married </em>people will face difficulties in this life, and I want to spare you. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>I’m telling you, it won’t be long till the ones that have wives will be as if they didn’t, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>those crying or rejoicing as if they weren’t, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>and those taking advantage of this world’s opportunities as not doing it fully. The situation’s changing, <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>and I don’t want you to have <em>distracting </em>concerns. An unmarried man tends to concern himself with the Lord’s things—how to please him;<sup> </sup><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>a married man feels a need to concern himself with this world’s things—how to be pleasing to his wife <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>and is torn. Unmarried women and virgins tend to be concerned about the Lord’s things—being holy in body and spirit; a married woman feels a need to concern herself with this world’s things—how to be pleasing to her husband. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>I’m saying this to help you, not to hold you back—to free you for orderly, undistracted devotion to the Lord.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 7:25-35</p>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> If a man thinks he’s being insensitive toward his virgin <em>daughter</em>, if she’s full-grown and wants to get married, he should follow his heart. He’s not sinning; do what he’s inclined to do; let them marry. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>But a man that’s made up his mind, stands firm in his heart, is under no pressure, has decided as far as he’s concerned to keep his virgin, he’s doing a good thing. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>So, the one who gives his virgin <em>daughter</em> in marriage does well, and the one that doesn’t does better.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> A wife is married to her husband for as long as he’s alive. If he dies, she’s free to marry whoever she wants to—only in the Lord. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>But she’d be happier if she stayed like she is, but that’s just me. I think <u>I</u> also have God’s Spirit.</span>
