## 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When I came, I didn’t use eloquence or wisdom to present what God had not previously revealed. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I determined not to know anything among you but Jesus Christ crucified. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I was weak and apprehensive while I was with you. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I didn’t present my message with eloquent words but with powerful demonstration of the Spirit. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>I did that so your faith wouldn’t rest on human wisdom but on divine power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>We do speak a kind of wisdom among mature people, but it’s not the kind the world or its rulers offer—who are passing away. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>It’s a previously unrevealed wisdom from God, <em>a wisdom </em>predestined before creation to our honor, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>a</em><em> wisdom</em> that no rulers in the world knew. If they’d known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the glorious Lord. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Like scripture says, <strong><em>“Eye hasn’t seen, ear hasn’t heard,</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>it hasn’t entered people’s mind</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>what God’s prepared for those who love him</em><em>”</em> <strong>[Is</strong><strong> 64:4; 52:15;</strong> Sir 1:10<strong>]</strong>. <strong>      </strong><strong>	 </strong><strong>1 Cor 2:1-9</strong> <strong>Revelation, Not Philosophy</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But God has revealed <em>them</em> to <u>us</u> by the Spirit, who examines everything, including the deep things about God. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Who knows a person’s things except that person’s spirit? The same way with God: nobody knows his things except his Spirit. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>We didn’t receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God so we could know what God’s graciously given us. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>We talk about those things, not in terms that human wisdom teaches, but in <em>terms</em> the Spirit teaches, explaining spiritual matters in spiritual terms. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Material-minded people don’t welcome God’s spiritual things; they seem like foolishness to them. <em>Material-minded</em> people can’t figure out spiritual things because spiritual things are examined from a spiritual point of view. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Spiritual people have a point of view for examining everything, but nobody can examine <u>them</u>.</span>
