## 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When I came, I didn't use eloquence or wisdom to present what God had not previously revealed. 2I determined not to know anything among you but Jesus Christ crucified. 3I was weak and apprehensive while I was with you. 4I didn't present my message with eloquent words but with powerful demonstration of the Spirit. 5I did that so your faith wouldn't rest on human wisdom but on divine power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We do speak a kind of wisdom among mature people, but it's not the kind the world or its rulers offer—who are passing away. 7It's a previously unrevealed wisdom from God, a wisdom predestined before creation to our honor, 8a wisdom that no rulers in the world knew. If they'd known it, they wouldn't have crucified the glorious Lord. 9Like scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But God has revealed them to us by the Spirit, who examines everything, including the deep things about God. 11Who knows a person's things except that person's spirit? The same way with God: nobody knows his things except his Spirit. 12We didn't receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God so we could know what God's graciously given us. 13We talk about those things, not in terms that human wisdom teaches, but in terms the Spirit teaches, explaining spiritual matters in spiritual terms. 14Material-minded people don't welcome God's spiritual things; they seem like foolishness to them. Material-minded people can't figure out spiritual things because spiritual things are examined from a spiritual point of view. 15Spiritual people have a point of view for examining everything, but nobody can examine them.</span>
