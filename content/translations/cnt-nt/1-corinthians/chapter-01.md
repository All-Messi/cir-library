## 1 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of ChristMessiah Jesus by God's will, and Sosthenes our brother, 2to God's church in Corinth, made holy in Christ and called to be saints with everyone everywhere that calls on our Lord. 3Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I always thank God for you and for the grace he's given you in Jesus. 5He has enriched you in word and knowledge, 6and confirmed in you the testimony about Christ. 7So you don't lack any gift as you anxiously wait for our Lord's return. 8He'll continue to confirm you to the end so you'll be blameless then. 9You can rely on God, who called you into fellowship with his Son.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I urge you, by our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony so there's no division among you. Unite in mind and purpose. 11Chloe's family has told me about the rivalry that's going on among you. 12This is what I mean: each of you is saying, "I'm with Paul"; "I'm with Apollos"; "I'm with Cephas"; "I'm with Christ." 13Is Christ divided up? Paul wasn't crucified for you, was he? Were you baptized to Paul? 14I'm glad I didn't baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15so you couldn't say I baptized you to myself. (16I did baptize the family of Stephanas; I don't remember baptizing anyone else.) 17Christ didn't send me to perform baptisms, but to deliver good news, not with an eloquence that could detract from the power of his cross.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The preaching about the cross is foolishness to people that perish; it's God's power to the people that are saved. 19Scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Where's the "wise"? Where's the scribe? Where's the skillful reasoner of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the world's "wisdom"? 21In his wisdom, the world didn't know him by wisdom. It pleased him to save believers by the "foolishness" of what we preach. 22Jews ask for signs; Greeks look for wisdom; 23but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks. 24But, to those who are called—Jews or Greeks—Christ is God's power and wisdom. 25God's foolishness is wiser than men; his weakness is stronger than men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> You don't see many wise, powerful, noble people called. 27God has chosen what's foolish to the world to put the wise to shame, weak things to put strong things to shame, 28insignificant and disregarded things—even what's not—to cancel out what is. 29He did it so nobody could act "proud" in his presence. 30By him you're in Christ Jesus, who has become for us a wisdom, goodness, sanctification, and redemption that comes from God. 31Like scripture says, "Whoever is proud should be proud of what he has in the LORD" [Jer 9:24].</span>
