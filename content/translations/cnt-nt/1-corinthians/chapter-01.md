## 1 Corinthians Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Paul, apostle of Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> Jesus by God’s will, and Sosthenes our brother, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to God’s church in Corinth, made holy in Christ and called <em>to be</em> saints with everyone everywhere that calls on our Lord. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>1</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Cor 1:1-3</p>

### Thanksgiving


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>I always thank God for you <em>and</em> for the grace he’s given you in Jesus. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He has enriched you in word and knowledge, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and confirmed in you the testimony about Christ. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So you don’t lack any gift as you anxiously wait for our Lord’s return. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He’ll continue to confirm you to the end so you’ll be blameless then. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>You can rely on God, who called you into fellowship with his Son. 	 <strong>1</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Cor 1:4-9</p>

### Call for Unity


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>I urge you, by our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony so there’s no division among you. Unite in mind and purpose. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Chloe’s family has told me about the rivalry that’s going on among you. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>This is what I mean: each of you is saying, <em>“I’m with Paul”; “I’m with Apollos”</em>;<em> “I’m with Cephas”</em>; <em>“I’m with </em><em>Christ</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Is Christ divided up? Paul wasn’t crucified for you, was he? Were you baptized to Paul? <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I’m glad I didn’t baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>so you couldn’t say I baptized you to myself. (<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>I did baptize the family of Stephanas; I don’t remember baptizing anyone else.) <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Christ didn’t send me to perform baptisms, but to deliver good news, not with an eloquence that could detract from the power of his cross.</span>

### Christ as Our Wisdom


<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The preaching about the cross is foolishness to people that perish; it’s God’s power to the people that are saved. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Scripture says, <strong><em>“I’ll destroy the wisdom of the wise</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and set aside the insight of the insightful”</em></strong><em> </em><strong>[Is </strong><strong>29:14</strong><strong>]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Where’s the “wise”? Where’s the scribe? Where’s the skillful reasoner of this world? Hasn’t God made foolish the world’s “wisdom”? <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>In his wisdom, the world didn’t know him by wisdom. It pleased him to save believers by the “foolishness” of what we preach. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Jews ask for signs; Greeks look for wisdom; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But, to those who are called—Jews or Greeks—Christ is God’s power and wisdom. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>God’s foolishness is wiser than men; his weakness is stronger than men.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 1:18-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>You don’t see many wise, powerful, noble people called. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>God has chosen what’s foolish to the world to put the wise to shame, weak things to put strong things to shame, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>insignificant and disregarded things—even what’s not—to cancel out what is. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>He did it so nobody could act “proud” in his presence. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>By him <u>you’re</u> in Christ Jesus, who has become for us a wisdom, goodness, sanctification, and redemption that comes from God. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Like scripture says, <strong><em>“Whoever </em></strong><strong><em>is</em></strong><strong><em> proud should </em></strong><strong><em>be</em></strong><strong><em> proud of what he has</em></strong><strong><em> in the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Jer</strong><strong> 9:24].</strong><strong> </strong><strong>	 </strong><strong>1</strong></span>
