## 1 Corinthians Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About the collection for the saints. Do what I told the churches in Galatia. 2Every first day of the week, each of you lay aside in store as things go for you, so there won't be any collecting after I get there. 3When I arrive, whoever you appoint, I'll send with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 4If it's appropriate for me to go too, we'll go together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'll see you after I go through Macedonia. 6I can stay with you a while or even spend the winter so you can send me on. 7I don't want to see you this time in passing, because I hope to stay a while, Lord willing. 8I'm going to stay in Ephesus till Pentecost 9because a wide, effective door has opened up for me, although there's a lot of opposition.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> If Timothy comes, see that he's welcome. He's doing the Lord's work like I am. 11Nobody should disregard him but send him on in peace so he can come back to me. I expect him to come with the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I strongly urged Apollos to come to you with the others, but he really didn't want to come now. He'll come when he can.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Stay alert, stand firm in the faith; be courageous and strong. 14Everything you do, do with love. 15-16You know that the family of Stephanas was the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they've devoted themselves to serving the saints. I urge you to cooperate with people like them and with everybody that labors in the work. 17I was so glad Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came, because they supplied what you hadn't yet provided. 18They've refreshed me—and you. Give recognition to people like them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The churches in Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly along with the church that meets in their house. 20The disciples all send their regards; greet one another with a holy kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The salutation with my own hand—Paul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> If somebody doesn't love the Lord, let him be accursed. Lord, come!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 24My love is with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span>
