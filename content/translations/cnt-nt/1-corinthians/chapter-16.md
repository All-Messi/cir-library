## 1 Corinthians Chapter 16

### The Collection for Hebrew Christians

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About the collection for the saints. Do what I told the churches in Galatia. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Every first <em>day</em> of the week, each of you lay aside in store as things go for you, so there won’t be any collecting after I get there. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When I arrive, whoever you appoint, I’ll send with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If it’s appropriate for me to go too, we’ll go together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I’ll see you after I go through Macedonia. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I can stay with you a<em> </em>while or even spend the winter so you can send me on. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I don’t want to see you this time in passing, because I hope to stay a while, Lord willing. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I’m going to stay in Ephesus till Pentecost <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>because a wide, effective door has opened up for me, although there’s a lot of opposition.<strong></span>

### The Activities of Paul’s Fellow Workers


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> If Timothy comes, see that he’s welcome. He’s doing the Lord’s work like I am. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Nobody should disregard him but send him on in peace so he can come back to me. I expect him <em>to come</em> with the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I strongly urged Apollos to come to you with the <em>others</em>, but he really didn’t want to come now. He’ll come when he can.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Stay alert, stand firm in the faith; be courageous and strong. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Everything you do, do with love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The churches in Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly along with the church <em>that meets</em> in their house. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The disciples all send their regards; greet one another with a holy kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The salutation with my own hand—Paul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> If somebody doesn’t love the Lord, let him be accursed. Lord, come!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus <em>be</em> with you. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>My love <em>is</em> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span>
