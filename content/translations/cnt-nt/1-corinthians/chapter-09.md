## 1 Corinthians Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord? 2If I'm not an apostle to other people, I am to you. You're the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Here's my defense to the ones who are criticizing me. 4Don't I have a right to eat? 5Don't I have a right to have a wife that's a sister in the faith like Cephas, the rest of the apostles, and the Lord's brothers? 6Are Barnabas and I the only ones that don't have a right not to work? 7What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and doesn't eat its fruit? Who tends sheep and doesn't drink their milk? 8I'm not just talking about human custom, am I? Doesn't the Law of Moses say that too? 9"Don't put a muzzle on an ox while it's threshing" [Deut 25:4]. God's not concerned here about oxen, is he? 10Isn't he speaking for our benefit? He wrote it for our benefit so the one who's threshing should work in hopes of sharing in the crops. 11If we sowed spiritual things to you, is it too much to reap material things from you? 12If other people share that right, don't we even more? 	1 Cor 9:1-12a But we haven't used that right. We endure things to keep from hindering the good news of Christ in any way. 13Don't you know that the ones who perform sacred services eat from the Temple, and that the ones who wait on the altar have a share from the altar? 14In the same way the Lord has directed that the ones who deliver the good news should have a living from it. 15But I haven't taken advantage of that provision, and I'm not writing this to change what we've been doing. I'd rather die than let anyone make my pride hollow. 16If I deliver the good news, I don't have anything to take pride in. I have to do that. Woe to me if I don't! 17If I do it because I want to, I'm entrusted with a stewardship. 18Where's my reward then? That I deliver the good news for free and not make use of my rights in it.	 1 Cor 9:12b-18</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Although I'm free from everybody, I've made myself a servant to everybody so I can win more of them. 20To Jews I've become like a Jew to win Jews. To people under law I've become like somebody under law—though I'm not really—to win people under law. 21To people not under law I've become like somebody not under law—though I am under God's law, Christ's 'law'—to win people not under law. 22To the weak I've become weak to win the weak. By all means I've become all things to all people to save some. 23I do everything for the sake of the good news so I can partake of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> As you know, everybody in a race runs, but only one wins the garland. Run so you'll be the one that wins it. 25Everybody that competes in the games exercises self-discipline in everything. They do it for a crown that deteriorates; we do it for one that doesn't. 26I don't just run around; I don't just shadow box. I discipline my body and keep it under control so, after I preach to other people, I don't disqualify myself.</span>
