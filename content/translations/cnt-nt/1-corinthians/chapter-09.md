## 1 Corinthians Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren’t you my work in the Lord? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>If I’m not an apostle to other people, I am to you. You’re the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Here’s my defense to the ones who are criticizing me. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Don’t I have a right to eat? <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Don’t I have a right to have a wife <em>that’s</em> a sister <em>in the faith</em> like Cephas, the rest of the apostles, and the Lord’s brothers? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Are Barnabas and I the only ones that don’t have a right not to work? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and doesn’t eat its fruit? Who tends sheep and doesn’t drink their milk? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I’m not just talking about human custom, am I? Doesn’t the Law <em>of Moses</em> say that too? <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong><em>“Don’t</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>put a </em></strong><strong><em>muzzle </em></strong><strong><em>on </em></strong><strong><em>an ox while it’s</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>threshing</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 25:4]</strong><strong>.</strong> God’s not concerned <em>here</em> about oxen, is he? <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Isn’t he speaking for <u>our</u> benefit? He wrote it for our benefit so the one who’s threshing should work in hopes of sharing in the crops. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>If we sowed spiritual things to you, <em>is it</em> too much to reap material things from you? <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>If other people share that right, don’t we e<em>ven</em> more?</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 9:1-</p>

### 12a But we haven’t used that right. We endure things to keep from hindering the good news of Christ in any way. 13Don’t you know that the ones who perform sacred services eat from the Temple, and that the ones who wait on the altar have a share from the altar? 14In the same way the Lord has directed that the ones who deliver the good news should have a living from it. 15But I haven’t taken advantage of that provision, and I’m not writing this to change what we’ve been doing. I’d rather die than let anyone make my pride hollow. 16If I deliver the good news, I don’t have anything to take pride in. I have to do that. Woe to me if I don’t! 17If I do it because I want to, I’m entrusted with a stewardship. 18Where’s my reward then? That I deliver the good news for free and not make use of my rights in it.	 1 Cor 9:12b-18


<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Although I’m free from everybody, I’ve made myself a servant to everybody so I can win more of them. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>To Jews I’ve become like a Jew to win Jews. To people under law I’ve become like somebody under law—though I’m not <em>really</em>—to win people under law. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>To people not under law I’ve become like somebody not under law—though I am under God’s law, Christ’s ‘law’—to win people not under law. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>To the weak I’ve become weak to win the weak. By all means I’ve become all things to all <em>people</em> to save some. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>I do everything for the sake of the good news so I can partake of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>As you know, everybody in a race runs, but only one wins the garland. Run so you’ll be the one that wins it<em>. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Everybody that competes in the games exercises self-discipline in everything. <u>They</u> do it for a crown that deteriorates; <u>we</u> <em>do it</em> for one that doesn’t. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>I<em> </em>don’t <em>just </em>run around; I don’t just shadow box. I discipline my body and keep it under control so, after I preach to other people, <u>I</u> don’t disqualify myself.</span>
