## 1 Corinthians Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My fellow Christians, I want you to know the most important thing in the good news I delivered to you, that you accepted, that you stand in, 2that saves you if you hold onto it (unless you've believed for nothing): 3Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, 4was buried, was resurrected the third day according to the scriptures, 5appeared to Cephas, then the Twelve, 6then to more than 500 disciples at the same time (most of them are still alive). 7Next he appeared to James and then to all the apostles. 8Last, he appeared to me like someone born out of season. 9I'm the least of the apostles and don't deserve to be called one because I persecuted God's church. 10But by God's grace I am what I am, and his grace to me has produced results. I've worked harder than any of them—not so much me, but God's grace in me. 11So whether it's me or them, Christ's resurrection is what we proclaimed and what you believed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If we proclaimed that Christ resurrected, how can some of you say there's no such thing as resurrection? 13If that's true, Christ hasn't resurrected. 14If he didn't, then our preaching is worthless and so's your faith. 15Besides, we're false witnesses for God because we've claimed he resurrected Christ, which he didn't do if there's no such thing as resurrection. 16If dead people don't resurrect, Christ didn't. 17If he didn't resurrect, your faith is useless, you're still in your sins, 18and the dead in Christ have perished. 19If we have hope in Christ only in this life, we're the most pitiable people alive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But, Christ has resurrected, the firstfruits from the dead. 21Since death came by man, resurrection came by man. 22As in Adam people die, so in Christ people resurrect—23each in sequence: Christ the firstfruits, then the ones that belong to him when he comes back. 24Then the end will come, when he does away with all other rule, authority, and power. 25He needs to reign till he overcomes all his enemies. 26The last enemy he'll overcome is death. 27"God will subject everything to him" [Ps 8:6]. When it says "everything," obviously it doesn't include the One who did the "subjecting." 28When God subjects "everything" to the Son, the Son will be subject to God, so God will be ultimate in everything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Otherwise, what will the ones baptized on behalf of the dead be doing? If the dead don't resurrect, why be baptized on their behalf? 30Why do we face danger all the time? 31By the pride we take in you, the pride we have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I tell you, I die every day. 32If, figuratively speaking, I fought wild animals in Ephesus, what good did it do? If the dead don't resurrect,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Don't kid yourselves,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Come to your senses about goodness, and don't practice sinning. It's a shame to say it, but some of you don't know God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Somebody might ask, "How do dead people resurrect? What kind of body do they come with?" 36Foolish one! What you plant doesn't come to life unless it dies. 37What you plant isn't the body it's going to become. You plant bare wheat seed, for example. 38God gives it the body he wants it to have, and each kind of seed has its own shape. 39 People, cattle, birds, and fish all look different. 40Things in the sky differ from things on the ground in how impressive they are. Things in the sky differ from each other in brightness—41the sun's brighter than the moon; the moon's brighter than the stars; the stars differ in how bright they are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> That's how resurrection is. What's planted in decay resurrects unable to decay; 43what's planted in dishonor resurrects in honor; what's planted in weakness resurrects in power; 44what's planted as a physical body resurrects as a spiritual one. There's a physical body and a spiritual body. 45Scripture says, the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 46But, the spiritual doesn't come first; the physical comes, then the spiritual. 47The first man is from the dust of the earth; the second man is from heaven. 48Earthly people are like the earth; heavenly ones are like heaven. 49As we've been like the earth, we'll be like heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> I'm saying that because flesh and blood can't inherit God's kingdom. What perishes doesn't inherit what doesn't perish. 51I'll tell you a mystery: not everybody will die, but everybody will be changed—52in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet blast. The trumpet will blow, and the dead will resurrect imperishable, and we'll be changed. 53This perishable body must put on what's not perishable; this mortal body must put on immortality. 54When that happens, what's written will take place, 55Death, where's your victory? 56"Death's sting" is sin, and sin's power is law. 57Thank God, who gives us the "victory" through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58So stay steadfast, unmovable, always excelling in the Lord's work. You know your labor in the Lord amounts to something.</span>
