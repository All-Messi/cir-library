### :1 Women's Decorum in Worship


<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I commend you for remembering me and maintaining the customs I passed on to you. 3I want you to know that God is the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every husband, and a husband is head of a wife. 4A man that prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head. 5A woman that prays or prophesies bareheaded disgraces her head. It's the same as shaving it. 6If a woman is bareheaded, she may as well be bald. If it's shameful for a woman to cut her hair off, she should cover her head. 7A man shouldn't cover his head because he's the image and delight of God. A wife is her husband's delight. 8Man didn't come from woman, but woman from man. 9Man wasn't created for woman, but woman for man. 10So she should wear a sign of authority on her head because of the angels. 11But, in the Lord a husband and wife exist as a combination. 12As woman came from man, man comes by woman, and everything comes from God. 13Judge for yourselves: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God bareheaded? 14Doesn't what's natural teach you that long hair dishonors a man, 15but it honors a woman? Long hair serves as a covering for her. 16If someone wants to argue about it, we don't have such a custom; neither do the churches of God. The Lord's Supper</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> In this next instruction, I'm not commending you, because your getting together doesn't make things better but worse. 18To begin with, when you get together for church, I hear there are divisions among you, and I'm inclined to believe it. 19Divisions even need to exist to show who are approved. 20When you get together, you can't be eating the Lord's Supper. 21Each one is bringing out his own supper, and one's hungry while another overeats. 22Don't you have houses to eat in? Do you disrespect God's church and embarrass people that don't have anything to eat? What can I say to you? Can I compliment you? Not for that, I can't.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I received from the Lord what I passed on to you. The night he was betrayed, he took a loaf, 24gave thanks, broke it, and said, "This is my body, which is for you. Do this in memory of me." 25After the meal he took the cup, "This cup is the New Covenant in my blood. As often as you drink it, do it in memory of me." 26As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you're expressing the Lord's death till he comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that's not appropriate, is guilty of his body and blood. 28That's why you need to examine yourself and eat the bread and drink the cup that way. 29If you eat and drink without recognizing the [Lord's]ms body, you eat and drink condemnation to yourself. 30That's why many of you are weak and sickly, and a considerable number are dying. 31If we examine ourselves, we won't be condemned. 32When we judge ourselves, the Lord disciplines us so we won't be condemned along with the world. 33So when you get together to eat, be considerate. 34If you're hungry, eat at home to avoid being condemned. I'll straighten out the rest when I get there. Teaching on Spiritual Gifts</span>
