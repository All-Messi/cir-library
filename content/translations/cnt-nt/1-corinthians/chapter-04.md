## 1 Corinthians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> People should consider us ministers of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries. 2A steward must be reliable, 3but it's not important to me that you or any human court would try to evaluate me; I don't even try to evaluate myself. 4My conscience is clear, but that doesn't make me right. The Lord's the One that evaluates me. 5So, don't rush to judgment before the Lord comes. He'll bring to light what darkness hides and reveal the motives in people's hearts. Then God will do the complimenting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I've applied these matters to me and Apollos to teach you not to go beyond what scripture says, so none of you will get conceited. 7Who makes yousg superior? What do yousg have you didn't receive? If you received it, why act proud as if you didn't. 8You'repl full! You're rich! You've become kings without us! I wish you had become kings so we could reign with you. 9I think God has placed us apostles last as sentenced to death. We've become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to people. 10We're fools for Christ; you're wise in him! We're weak; you're strong! We're disrespected; you're respectable! 11To this day we're hungry, thirsty, poorly clothed, harassed, homeless, 12-13and do manual labor. We bless in return for insult and encourage in return for slander. We're patient when persecuted, and still treated like trash—like the scum of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'm not writing this to make you feel bad, but to warn you like children I care about. 15You may have countless instructors in Christ, but not lots of fathers. I became your father in Christ through the good news. 16So follow my example. 17That's why I'm sending Timothy, my dear friend, reliable child in the Lord. He'll remind you about my ways in the Lord like I teach everywhere in every church. 18Some of you proudly claim that I won't come to you. 19But I'll come soon, Lord willing, and I'll find out, not the talk of the proud, but their power. 20God's kingdom is not in talk but in power. 21What do you want me to do, come with a rod or with love and a gentle spirit?</span>
