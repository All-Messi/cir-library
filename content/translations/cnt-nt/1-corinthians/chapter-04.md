## 1 Corinthians Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>People should consider us ministers of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>A steward must be reliable, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>but it’s not important to me that you or any human court would try to evaluate me; I don’t even try to evaluate myself. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>My conscience is clear, but that doesn’t make me right. The Lord’s the One that evaluates me. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So, don’t rush to judgment before the Lord comes. He’ll bring to light what darkness hides and reveal the motives in <em>people’s</em> hearts. Then <u>God</u> will do the complimenting.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Cor 4:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>I’ve applied these matters to me and Apollos to teach you not to go beyond what scripture says, so none of you will get conceited. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Who makes you<sup>sg</sup> superior? What do you<sup>sg</sup> have you didn’t receive? If you received it, why act proud as if you didn’t. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>You’re<sup>pl</sup> full! You’re rich! You’ve become kings without us! I wish you <u>had</u> become kings so we could reign with you. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I think God has placed us apostles last as sentenced to death. We’ve become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to people. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>We’re fools for Christ; you’re wise in him! We’re weak; you’re strong! We’re disrespected; you’re respectable! <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>To this day we’re hungry, thirsty, poorly clothed, harassed, homeless, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and do manual labor. We bless in return for insult and encourage in return for slander. We’re patient when persecuted, and still treated like trash—like the scum of the earth.	 <strong>1</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>I’m not writing this to make you feel bad, but to warn you like children I care about. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>You may have countless instructors in Christ, but not lots of fathers. <u>I</u> became your father in Christ through the good news. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So follow my example. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>That’s why I’m sending Timothy, my dear friend, reliable child in the Lord. He’ll remind you about my ways in the Lord like I teach everywhere in every church. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Some of you proudly claim that I won’t come to you. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>But I’ll come soon, Lord willing, and I’ll find out, not the talk of the proud, but their power. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God’s kingdom is not in talk but in power. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>What do you want me to do, come with a rod or with love and a gentle spirit?</span>
