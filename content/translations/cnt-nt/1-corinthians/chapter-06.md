## 1 Corinthians Chapter 6

### Christians and Lawsuits

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong> Cor 6:1-11</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I can do all <em>kinds of</em> things, but they’re not all beneficial, and I won’t put myself under their control. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Food’s for the stomach, and the stomach’s for food, but God will destroy it and them. The body is not for immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But God has resurrected the Lord, and he’ll resurrect us by his power. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Don’t you know your bodies are parts of Christ? So am I going to take parts of Christ and make <em>them</em> parts of a prostitute? Goodness, no! <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Don’t you know that whoever joins himself to a prostitute is one body <em>with her </em>physically? <em>God</em> says, <strong><em>“The two will become one physical identity</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 2:24]</strong>.<em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Whoever joins himself to the Lord is one spiritual identity <em>with him</em>. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Run from sexual immorality. Every sin a person commits is aside from the body, but sexual sin is a sin against a person’s own body. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Don’t you know your<sup>pl</sup> body is a temple for God’s Holy Spirit that’s in you<sup>pl</sup>? You<sup>pl</sup> don’t own yourselves; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>you’ve been purchased. So praise God with your body.</span>
