## 1 Corinthians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>If you have something against a <em>fellow Christian</em>, do any of you<em> </em>dare go to court in front of sinners rather than saints? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You know, don’t you, that the saints will judge the world? If you’re going to judge the world, can’t you <em>judge</em> small matters? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You know, don’t you, that you’ll judge angels, much less matters of everyday life? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If you have courts that deal with everyday matters, appoint <em>as judges</em> the ones looked down on in the church. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>I’m saying this so you’ll be ashamed: don’t you have anybody among you smart enough to decide between his fellow believers? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Christians take Christians to court and do it in front of unbelievers? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>It’s a real defect in you that you bring lawsuits against each other. Wouldn’t it be better to let yourselves be wronged or defrauded? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But <u>you</u> do the wronging and defrauding, and <em>do it</em> to fellow Christians, at that. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Don’t you know that bad people won’t inherit God’s kingdom? Don’t kid yourselves: sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate <em>men</em>, homosexuals, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>thieves, covetous people, drunkards, revilers, swindlers won’t inherit his kingdom. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Some of you were like that, but you were washed, sanctified, made good in the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God. <strong>1</strong><strong> Cor 6:1-11</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I can do all <em>kinds of</em> things, but they’re not all beneficial, and I won’t put myself under their control. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Food’s for the stomach, and the stomach’s for food, but God will destroy it and them. The body is not for immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But God has resurrected the Lord, and he’ll resurrect us by his power. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Don’t you know your bodies are parts of Christ? So am I going to take parts of Christ and make <em>them</em> parts of a prostitute? Goodness, no! <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Don’t you know that whoever joins himself to a prostitute is one body <em>with her </em>physically? <em>God</em> says, <strong><em>“The two will become one physical identity</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 2:24]</strong>.<em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Whoever joins himself to the Lord is one spiritual identity <em>with him</em>. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Run from sexual immorality. Every sin a person commits is aside from the body, but sexual sin is a sin against a person’s own body. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Don’t you know your<sup>pl</sup> body is a temple for God’s Holy Spirit that’s in you<sup>pl</sup>? You<sup>pl</sup> don’t own yourselves; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>you’ve been purchased. So praise God with your body.</span>
