## 1 Corinthians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If you have something against a fellow Christian, do any of you dare go to court in front of sinners rather than saints? 2You know, don't you, that the saints will judge the world? If you're going to judge the world, can't you judge small matters? 3You know, don't you, that you'll judge angels, much less matters of everyday life? 4If you have courts that deal with everyday matters, appoint as judges the ones looked down on in the church. 5I'm saying this so you'll be ashamed: don't you have anybody among you smart enough to decide between his fellow believers? 6Christians take Christians to court and do it in front of unbelievers? 7It's a real defect in you that you bring lawsuits against each other. Wouldn't it be better to let yourselves be wronged or defrauded? 8But you do the wronging and defrauding, and do it to fellow Christians, at that. 9Don't you know that bad people won't inherit God's kingdom? Don't kid yourselves: sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate men, homosexuals, 10thieves, covetous people, drunkards, revilers, swindlers won't inherit his kingdom. 11Some of you were like that, but you were washed, sanctified, made good in the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I can do all kinds of things, but they're not all beneficial, and I won't put myself under their control. 13Food's for the stomach, and the stomach's for food, but God will destroy it and them. The body is not for immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body. 14But God has resurrected the Lord, and he'll resurrect us by his power. 15Don't you know your bodies are parts of Christ? So am I going to take parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute? Goodness, no! 16Don't you know that whoever joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her physically? God says, "The two will become one physical identity" [Gen 2:24]. 17Whoever joins himself to the Lord is one spiritual identity with him. 18Run from sexual immorality. Every sin a person commits is aside from the body, but sexual sin is a sin against a person's own body. 19Don't you know yourpl body is a temple for God's Holy Spirit that's in youpl? Youpl don't own yourselves; 20you've been purchased. So praise God with your body.</span>
