## 2 John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong> Jn 1:5-10</strong> 	<strong>Christ Our Advocate</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I was so happy to find yoursg children living in the truth the Father commanded us. 5Now I urge you, lady—not as some new commandment but what we've had all along: love one another 6and so be living his way. 7Many deceivers have gone out who don't agree that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. They're deceivers and antichrist. 8Watch that you not lose what you've gained, but receive a full reward. 9Anybody that goes out on his own and doesn't stay in Christ's teaching doesn't have God. The one that stays in his teaching has both the Father and the Son. 10If a person doesn't bring that teaching, don't invite him into your house or greet him. 11Whoever greets him shares in his evil work.</span>
