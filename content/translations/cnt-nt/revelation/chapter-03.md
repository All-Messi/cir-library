## Revelation Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Write this to the evangelist for the church in Sardis: 'This is what he says who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: "I know what you're doing, that you're alive in name only. 2Wake up and strengthen what's left that's about to die. I haven't found your deeds perfect in front of my God. 3So remember what you've received, keep it, and repent. If you don't wake up, I'll come like a thief at night when you don't expect it. 4You have a few in Sardis that haven't gotten their clothes dirty. They'll live with me in white because they're worthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Those who are victorious I'll dress in white clothes, I won't remove from the Book of Life, and I'll acknowledge in front of my Father and his angels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Whoever has an ear, listen to what the Spirit's telling the churches."'" 8"I know what you're doing. I've opened a door for you that nobody can shut. Because you have a little strength, you've kept my word and haven't denied me. 9The ones that claim to be Jews but belong to Satan's synagogue, I'll make bow down to you and recognize that I love you. 10Because you've kept my word and persevered, I'll protect you from the testing that's coming on the world. 11I'm coming soon; hold onto what you have so nobody takes your crown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Those who are victorious I'll make pillars in the Temple of my God, and they'll never leave it. I'll write my new name on them, the name of my God, and the name of his city, the New Jerusalem that's coming down out of heaven from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Whoever has an ear, listen to what the Spirit's telling the churches.'" 'This is what the faithful and true witness says, the ruler of God's creation: 15"I know what you're doing—that you're not hot or cold. I'd rather you were one or the other. 16Since you're lukewarm, I'll spew you out of my mouth. 17You say, 'I'm rich; I've made money and don't need anything.' You don't realize that you're miserable, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked. 18I advise you to buy gold from me refined by fire so you'll be rich, white clothes to cover your nakedness, and eye salve so you can see. 19I reprove and discipline the ones I care about; so be earnest and repent. 20I'm knocking at the door. If anybody hears me and opens it, I'll come in and we'll eat together. 21"Those who are victorious will sit with me on my throne like I overcame and sat with my Father on his throne.</span>
