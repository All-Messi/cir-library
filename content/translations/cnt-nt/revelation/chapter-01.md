<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The relevation God gave to Jesus CjhristMessiah to show his servants about what must happen soon. He sent it through his angel to his servant John, 2who has passed on everything he saw about God's message and Jesus Christ's revelation. 3Blessed is the one who reads and the ones that hear the prophecyfem and keep what's written in itfem. It's coming soon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> John, to the seven churches in Asia. Grace and peace from him who is and was and is to come, from the seven spirits in front of his throne, 5-6and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, firstborn from the dead, ruler over the kings of the world. Glory and dominion forevermore to him who loved us, released us from our sins with his blood, and made us into a kingdom of priests to his God and Father. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He'll come with the clouds; 8"I'm Alpha and Omega," the Lord God Almighty says, who is and was and is to come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'm John, yourpl brother, who shares your hardships, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus.  I was exiled on the island Patmos for preaching God's message and for my testimony about Jesus. 10I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day when I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet, 11"Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I turned around to see who was talking to me, and I saw seven gold lampstands. 13Among them was One that looked like a man in a long robe with a wide gold sash across his chest. 14His hair was white like wool, and his eyes flamed like fire. 15His feet looked like refined, polished brass; and his voice sounded like crashing waves. 16He held seven stars in his right hand and had a sharp double-edged sword coming out of his mouth. His face shined like the sun at its brightest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When I saw him, I fell down like a dead man. He put his right hand on me, "Don't be afraid. I'm the First and Last, 18the Living One that died and came back to life forevermore. I have the keys to death and the grave. 19Write down what you've seen, what is and will be. 20The seven stars in my right hand are the evangelists for the seven churches; the lampstands are the churches."</span>
