<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The relevation God gave to Jesus Cjhrist<sup>Messiah</sup> to show his servants about what must happen soon.

It’s coming soon.</span>

### Salutation


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>John, to the seven churches in Asia. Grace and peace from him who is and was and is to come, from the seven spirits in front of his throne, <strong><sup>5-</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, firstborn from the dead, ruler over the kings of the world. Glory and dominion forevermore to him who loved us, released us from our sins with his blood, and made us into a kingdom of priests to his God and Father. Amen.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 1:4-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He’ll come with the clouds; everyone will see him, including those who pierced him. Every tribe on earth will mourn because of him. Yes. Amen <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“I’m</em><em> Alpha and Omega,”</em> the Lord God Almighty says, who is and was and is to come.</span>

### Vision of Christ


<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I’m John, your<sup>pl </sup>brother, who shares your hardships, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus.  I was exiled on the island Patmos for preaching God’s message and for my testimony about Jesus. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I was in the spirit on the Lord’s Day when I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Write</em><em> </em><em>on a scroll what you see and s</em><em>end it to the </em><em>seven</em><em> churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”</em><em>                       </em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	        </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>I turned around to see who was talking to me, and I saw seven gold lampstands. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Among them was One that looked like a man in a long robe with a wide gold sash across his chest. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>His hair was white like wool, and his eyes flamed like fire. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>His feet looked like refined, polished brass; and his voice sounded like crashing waves. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He held seven stars in his right hand and had a sharp double-edged sword coming out of his mouth. His face shined like the sun at its brightest.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 1:9-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When I saw him, I fell down like a dead man. He put his right hand on me, <em>“D</em><em>on’t be afraid.</em><em> </em><em>I’m </em><em>the First and Last</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>the</em><em> Living One that died and came back to life </em><em>forever</em><em>more</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I have </em><em>the keys </em><em>to death and the grave</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Write</em><em> down </em><em>what</em><em> you’ve seen, what is</em><em> and will be.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>seven</em><em> stars in my r</em><em>ight hand are the evangelists for</em><em> the </em><em>seven</em><em> churches; the lampstands are the churches.</em><em>”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
