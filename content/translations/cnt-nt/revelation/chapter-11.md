## Revelation Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I received a measuring rod like a staff. "Measure God's sanctuary, the altar, and the worshipers. 2Don't measure the court outside the sanctuary because the Gentiles have received it, and they'll trample the Holy City underfoot for 42 months. 3I'll authorize my two witnesses to prophecy for those 1260 days in burlap and ashes." 4They're two olive trees, two lampstands in front of the Lord of the earth. 5If anybody tries to injure them, fire will come out of their mouths and burn them up. 6During the time they prophesy, they'll have authority to keep it from raining, to turn water into blood, to strike the earth with any plague as often as they like. 7When they've finished speaking for God, the beast from the abyss will attack them, conquer, and kill them. 8Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also was crucified. 9People from tribes, languages, and nations will look at their corpses for 3½ days and won't let them be buried. 10They'll celebrate and send gifts to each other because those two prophets had tormented them. 11After 3½ days, breath from God will return, and they'll stand up and terrify everyone that sees them. 12I heard a loud voice from heaven tell them, "Come up here"; and they went up in a cloud while their enemies watched. 13Then a severe earthquake made a tenth of the city fall; 7,000 people died in the earthquake. Fear overwhelmed the rest, and they praised the God of heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The second woe is over. The third's coming soon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and loud voices from heaven said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The 24 elders on their thrones in front of God fell on their faces and worshiped him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The nations raged, and your anger came.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> God's sanctuary in heaven opened, and the Ark of the Covenant became visible there. There came lightning flashes, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a severe hailstorm.</span>
