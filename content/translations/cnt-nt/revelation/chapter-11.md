## Revelation Chapter 11

### The Two Witnesses

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I received a measuring rod like a staff. <em>“Measure God’s sanctuary, the altar, and the worshipers.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> measure the court </em><em>outside</em><em> the sanctuary because the </em><em>Gentiles</em><em> have received it, and they’ll trample the Holy City underfoot for 42 months.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> authorize my two witnesses to prophecy for </em>those <em>1260 days in </em><em>burlap</em><em> and ashes.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’re two olive trees, two lampstands in front of the Lord of the earth. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>If anybody tries to injure them, fire will come out of their mouths and burn them up. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>During the time they prophesy, they’ll have authority to keep it from raining, to turn water into blood, to strike the earth with any plague as often as they like. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When they’ve finished speaking <em>for God</em>, the beast from the abyss will attack them, conquer, and kill them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also was crucified. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>People from tribes, languages, and nations will look at their corpses for 3½ days and won’t let them be buried. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They’ll celebrate and send gifts to each other because those two prophets had tormented them. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>After 3½ days, breath from God will return, and they’ll stand up and terrify everyone that sees them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I heard a loud voice from heaven tell them, <em>“Come up here”</em>; and they went up in a cloud while their enemies watched. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Then a severe earthquake made a tenth of the city fall; 7,000 people died in the earthquake. Fear overwhelmed the rest, and they praised the God of heaven.</span>

### The Seventh Trumpet/The Third Woe


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and loud voices from heaven said, “<em>The kingdom of this world has become </em> the kingdom<em> of our </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> and his </em><em>Christ</em><em><sup>Messiah</sup></em><em>, </em> <em>and he’ll reign foreve</em><em>rmore</em><em>.”</em><em>                                         </em><em>	</em><em>	     </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The 24 elders on their thrones in front of God fell on their faces and worshiped him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“</em><em>Thank</em><em> you, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God Almighty, who is and was,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	b</em><em>ecause you’</em><em>ve </em><em>assumed</em><em> power and </em><em>begun</em><em> to reign.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>The</em><em> nations raged, and your anger came.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em> </em><em>The time came </em><em>for judging</em><em> the dead,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>the time </em><em>for rewarding </em><em>your servants the prophets and </em><em>saints</em><em>— </em> <em>those who respect you from least to </em><em>greatest;</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>the time </em><em>for destroying </em><em>those who </em><em>destroy the </em><em>world</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> God’s sanctuary in heaven opened, and the Ark of the Covenant became visible there. There came lightning flashes, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a severe hailstorm.</span>
