It told them to make an image to the beast that had the sword wound and came back to life. 15It was allowed to make the image of the first beast breathe so it could even speak, and it was allowed to execute people that refused to worship the image. 16It made everybody—great or small, rich or poor, servant or free—receive a stamp on the forehead or right hand. 17They couldn't buy or sell without the stamp of the beast or the number of its name. 18ere is insight; let the discerJHere Here's a hint for a discerning person to calculate its number.
