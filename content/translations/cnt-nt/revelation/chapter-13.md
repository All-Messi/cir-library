## Revelation Chapter 13

### The Beast from the Sea

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The dragon stood on the sand on the seashore. I watched as a beast came up out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, ten diadems, and blasphemous names on its heads. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>It looked like a leopard with bear’s feet and a lion’s mouth. The dragon gave it power, dominion, and great authority. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>One of its heads looked like it had been mortally wounded and its mortal wound had healed. The whole earth marveled at the beast <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and worshiped the dragon that gave it authority. They also worshiped the beast, <em>“Who’s like it</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Who can wage war with it?”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 13:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The beast was allowed to speak great blasphemous things and have authority <em>to do it </em>for 42 months. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>It blasphemed God, his tabernacle, and those who live in heaven. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>It was allowed to fight the saints and defeat them, and to control every tribe, people group, language, and nation. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>People worshiped it<em> </em>whose names weren’t in the Lamb’s Book of Life, <em>the Lamb </em>that was slain from the founding of the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Whoever has an ear, listen:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> snyone that’s <em>destined </em>for captivity will go into captivity; anyone that murders with a sword will be killed with a sword. That’s why the saints stay confident.</span>

### The Beast from the Land


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I watched another beast come up out of the land. It had two horns like a lamb and talked like a dragon. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>It exercised all the authority the first beast had, and made people worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had healed. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>It performed great signs, even making fire come down from the sky. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>It deceived people with the signs it was allowed to do in front of the <em>first </em>beast. It told them to make an image to the beast that had the sword wound and came back to life. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>It was allowed to make the image of the <em>first </em>beast breathe so it could even speak, and it was allowed to execute people that refused to worship the image. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>It made everybody—great or small, rich or poor, servant or free—receive a stamp on the forehead or right hand. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They couldn’t buy or sell without the stamp of the beast or the number of its name. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>ere is insight; let the discerJHere Here’s a hint for a discerning person to calculate its number. It’s the number in use among people: 666.<strong> </strong></span>
