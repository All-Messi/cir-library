## Revelation Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, I watched a different angel come down from the sky with great authority, and his glory lit up the world. 2He shouted,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> All the nations have gotten drunk on the wine of her immoral fury.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I heard another voice from the sky,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Her sins have piled up to the sky;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pay her back like she paid;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As much as she glorified herself and lived sensuously,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The kings that committed immoral acts and lived sensuously with her will cry and mourn when they see the smoke from her burning. 10They'll stand a long way off in fear of her torment,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The merchants will cry and mourn over it because nobody's buying their merchandise anymore: 12gold, silver, precious stones, pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, red; different kinds of scented wood, articles made out of ivory and expensive wood, bronze, iron, marble; 13cinnamon, spice, incense, perfume, frankincense; wine, olive oil, fine wheat flour, wheat; cattle, sheep, horses, four-wheeled chariots, slaves (human lives).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Merchants who got rich from those things will stand a long way off, crying and mourning, in fear of her torment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> In a moment such wealth has disappeared!" Shipmasters and sailors, who make their living on the sea, will stand a long way off 18and cry as they watch the smoke from her burning. "What other city is like this great city?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They'll throw dust on their heads, shout, cry, and weep,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Rejoice over it, heaven, saints, apostles, and prophets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> A strong angel picked up a stone the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters</span>
