## Revelation Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I saw the Lamb standing on Mt. Zion with the 144,000 that had his and his Father's name written on their foreheads. 2I heard a noise from heaven like crashing waves and loud thunder—like harpists playing harps. 3They sang a new song in front of the throne, the four living beings, and the elders. Nobody could learn the song except the 144,000 that had been purchased out of the earth. 4They hadn't defiled themselves with women; they were virgins, who followed the Lamb wherever he went. They'd been purchased from among people as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. 5They'd never lied; they were blameless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I saw another angel flying in the sky who had the everlasting good news to present to every nation, tribe, language, and people group. 7He shouted, "Fear God and honor him! His time for judging has come. Worship the One that made sky, earth, sea, and springs."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A second angel followed, "Fallen, fallen, 'Babylon' the Great that made the nations drink the wine of her immoral passion."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A third angel followed them, shouting, "Those who have worshiped the beast and its image and received a stamp on their forehead or right hand, 10will drink the wine of God's displeasure full strength. They'll be tormented with fire and sulfur in front of the holy angels and the Lamb. The smoke from their torment will go up forevermore. 11There'll be no rest day or night for those who've worshiped the beast and its image and received the stamp of its name. 12That's why the saints stay confident in Christ."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I heard a voice from the sky, "Write this, 'People that die in the Lord from now on are fortunate.' 'Yes,' the Spirit says, 'so they can rest from their labors, because the account of their deeds stays on their record.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I saw what looked like a man sitting on a white cloud. He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp scythe in his hand. 15Another angel came out of the sanctuary in heaven and called out to him, "Use your scythe to reap; it's time to harvest; earth's harvest is ready." 16The one on the cloud swung his scythe over the earth and harvested it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Another angel came out of the sanctuary, holding a sharp hook-blade. 18Another angel came out of the altar with authority over fire and shouted to the one with the hook-blade, "Use your blade to gather the clusters from the vine (the world); the grapes are ripe." 19The angel used it to harvest the vine, and he put the grapes in the large winepress of God's anger. 20The wine was pressed out outside the city, and the blood from the winepress came up to the horses' bridles for some 180 miles.</span>
