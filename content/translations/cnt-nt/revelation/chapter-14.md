### ,000 that had his and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 2I heard a noise from heaven like crashing waves and loud thunder—like harpists playing harps. 3They sang a new song in front of the throne, the four living beings, and the elders. Nobody could learn the song except the 144,000 that had been purchased out of the earth. 4They hadn’t defiled themselves with women; they were virgins, who followed the Lamb wherever he went. They’d been purchased from among people as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. 5They’d never lied; they were blameless.   	 Rev 14:1-5 The Messages from Three Angels


<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I saw another angel flying in the sky who had the everlasting good news to present to every nation, tribe, language, and people group. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He shouted, <em>“Fear God and honor him! </em><em>His time for judging has come.</em><em> </em><em>Worship the One </em><em>that</em><em> made sky, earth, sea, and springs.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>A second angel followed, <em>“Fallen, fallen, </em><em>‘</em><em>Babylon</em><em>’</em><em> </em><em>the Great </em><em>that made t</em><em>he nations drink the wine of her immoral</em><em> </em><em>passion</em><em>.”</em><em>                                           </em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	        </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>A third angel followed them, shouting, <em>“</em><em>Those who have</em><em> worshiped the beast and its image </em><em>and</em><em> received </em><em>a stamp</em><em> on </em><em>their</em><em> forehead or right hand, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>wi</em><em>ll</em><em> drink the wine of God’s </em><em>displeasure</em><em> full strength.</em><em> They</em><em>’ll be tormented </em><em>with fire and sulf</em><em>ur </em><em>in front of</em><em> the holy angels and the Lamb.</em><em> </em><em>The</em><em> smoke from their torment will go up forevermore. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>There’ll</em><em> be </em><em>no rest day or night for </em><em>those who’ve </em><em>worshiped the beast and its image and received the stamp of its name.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>That’s</em><em> why</em><em> the saints </em><em>stay</em><em> confident</em><em> in Christ</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>I heard a voice from the sky, <em>“Write</em><em> </em>this<em>, ‘</em><em>People that </em><em>die in the Lord from now on</em><em> are fortunate</em><em>.’</em><em> </em><em>‘Yes,’ </em>the Spirit says, <em>‘so they can rest from their labors, because </em>the account of <em>their deeds </em><em>stays</em><em> </em><em>on their record</em><em>.’”</em><em>  </em><em>	</em></span>

### Harvesting the Earth


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I saw what looked like a man sitting on a white cloud. He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp scythe in his hand. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Another angel came out of the sanctuary in heaven and called out to him, <em>“Use your scythe to reap</em><em>;</em><em> it’s time </em><em>to</em><em> harvest; earth’s harvest is ready.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The one on the cloud swung his scythe over the earth and harvested it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Another angel came out of the sanctuary, holding a sharp hook-blade. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Another angel came out of the altar with authority over fire and shouted to the one with the hook-blade, <em>“Use your blade to gather the clusters from the vine (</em><em>the </em><em>world</em><em>)</em><em>; </em><em>the grapes are ripe.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The angel used it to harvest the vine, and he put the grapes in the large winepress of God’s anger. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The wine was pressed out outside the city, and the blood from the winepress came up to the horses’ bridles for</span>
