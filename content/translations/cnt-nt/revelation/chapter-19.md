## Revelation Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, I heard what sounded like a great crowd in heaven, <em>“Hallelujah!</em> <em>	</em><em>	Salvation, glory, and pow</em><em>er to our G</em><em>od</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>because</em><em> his judgments are true and </em><em>just</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	h</em><em>e</em><em>’s</em><em> judged the great </em><em>prostitute</em> <em>	that corrupted the earth with her </em><em>immorality</em><em>;</em> <em>h</em><em>e</em><em>’</em><em>s avenged the </em><em>murder</em><em> of his servants </em><em>at</em><em> her hand.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 19:1-2</p>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A second time they shouted, <em>“Hallelujah!</em><em>” </em> and her smoke rose up forevermore. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The 24 elders and the 4 living beings knelt down and worshiped God Almighty, who sits on the throne, <em>“Amen!</em><em> </em><em>Hallelujah!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> A voice came from the throne, <em>“Praise our God, </em><em>all his servants,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>everybody that </em><em>fear</em><em>s him from least</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> grea</em><em>tes</em><em>t.”</em><em>                                </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I heard a great crowd like crashing waves and loud thunder, <em>“Hallelujah!</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God Almighty </em><em>has taken up his reign</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>Let’s</em><em> rejoice</em><em>,</em><em> be </em><em>happy, </em><em>and give him glory,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>because the marriage of the Lamb has come, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>and his bride has </em><em>gotten herself ready</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> She was allowed to dress in bright clean linen, the righteous acts of the saints.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 19:3-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The angel said to me, <em>“Write</em><em> </em>this down<em>:</em><em> </em><em>‘</em><em>People are fortunate who are</em><em> invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb.</em><em> That is God’s true message</em><em>.’”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I fell down in front of him in worship him, but he said, <em>“Don’t do that.</em><em> </em><em>I’m a fellow servant with you and your brothers that have the message about Jesus.</em><em> </em><em>Worship God.</em><em> </em><em>The message about Jesus is the </em><em>purpose</em><em> of prophecy.”</em><em>                                                            </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I watched heaven open up. There was a white horse with a Rider called Faithful and True. He judged rightly and waged war justly. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>His eyes were like flames; he wore several diadems and had a name that nobody understood but him. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He wore a robe soaked in blood; his name was The Word of God. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The armies in heaven, wearing clean white linen, followed him on white horses. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>From his mouth came a sharp sword for striking the nations. He shepherded them with an iron rod and trod the winepress of the fierce anger of God Almighty. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>On the thigh of his robe, it said <em>King of kings,</em><em> Lord of lords.</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 19:9-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I saw an angel standing in the sun. He shouted to the vultures in the sky, <em>“F</em><em>lock to </em><em>God’s</em><em> great feast</em><em>! </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>E</em><em>at</em><em> the flesh of kings, commanders</em><em> [chiliarchs]*</em><em>, powerful men, horses, and </em><em>riders!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I watched the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gather to battle the Rider on the horse and his armies. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He and his forces captured the beast and the false prophet that performed signs in front of it, <em>signs </em>it used to deceive people that had the stamp of the beast and worshiped its image. They threw them both alive into the burning sulfur lake. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Rider on the horse killed the rest with the sword from his mouth, and the vultures gorged on their flesh.</span>
