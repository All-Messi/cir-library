## Revelation Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, I heard what sounded like a great crowd in heaven,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A second time they shouted, and her smoke rose up forevermore. 4The 24 elders and the 4 living beings knelt down and worshiped God Almighty, who sits on the throne,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> A voice came from the throne,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I heard a great crowd like crashing waves and loud thunder,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Let's rejoice, be happy, and give him glory,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> She was allowed to dress in bright clean linen, the righteous acts of the saints.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The angel said to me, "Write this down: 'People are fortunate who are invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb. That is God's true message.'" 10I fell down in front of him in worship him, but he said, "Don't do that. I'm a fellow servant with you and your brothers that have the message about Jesus. Worship God. The message about Jesus is the purpose of prophecy."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I watched heaven open up. There was a white horse with a Rider called Faithful and True. He judged rightly and waged war justly. 12His eyes were like flames; he wore several diadems and had a name that nobody understood but him. 13He wore a robe soaked in blood; his name was The Word of God. 14The armies in heaven, wearing clean white linen, followed him on white horses. 15From his mouth came a sharp sword for striking the nations. He shepherded them with an iron rod and trod the winepress of the fierce anger of God Almighty. 16On the thigh of his robe, it said King of kings, Lord of lords.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I saw an angel standing in the sun. He shouted to the vultures in the sky, "Flock to God's great feast! 18Eat the flesh of kings, commanders [chiliarchs]*, powerful men, horses, and riders!" 19I watched the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gather to battle the Rider on the horse and his armies. 20He and his forces captured the beast and the false prophet that performed signs in front of it, signs it used to deceive people that had the stamp of the beast and worshiped its image. They threw them both alive into the burning sulfur lake. 21The Rider on the horse killed the rest with the sword from his mouth, and the vultures gorged on their flesh.</span>
