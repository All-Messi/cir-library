## Revelation Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>An important sign appeared in the sky, a woman dressed in the sun with the moon under her feet and twelve crowns on her head. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She was pregnant and cried out in labor, straining to give birth. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Another sign appeared in the sky, a big red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven diadems on its heads. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Its tail dragged down a third of the stars and threw them onto earth. It stood in front of the woman, <em>ready</em> to devour her child. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>She had a Son that would rule the nations with an iron rod. He was snatched up to God and his throne, and <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>the woman ran into the desert. God had prepared a place there for people to sustain</span>

### days. 	Rev 12:1-6


<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>War broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels battling the dragon and his angels. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The dragon wasn’t powerful enough, and he and his angels no longer had a place in heaven. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The great dragon was thrown out, the old serpent, the devil, Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He and his angels were thrown down to earth. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I heard a loud voice in heaven, <em>“Now salvation and power</em><em> </em><em>has come,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>the kingdom of our God,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>the authority of his </em><em>Christ</em><em><sup>Messiah</sup></em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	b</em><em>ecause our brothers</em><em>’ accuser</em><em> has been </em><em>thrown</em><em> out</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>who accused them </em><em>in front of</em><em> our God day and night.</em><em>      </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> </em><em>triumphed over </em>their accuser<em> </em> <em>by</em><em> the blood of the Lamb and </em><em>by </em><em>his </em><em>message;</em> <em>t</em><em>hey didn’t love their life </em><em>so much that they</em><em> </em><em>shrank from </em><em>death.</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> celebrate, heaven, and you that tabernacle there.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em> </em><em>Woe</em><em> to land and sea</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because the devil has c</em><em>ome down to you </em><em>furious;</em> <em>	</em><em>he knows</em><em> he doesn’t have much time left.</em><em>” </em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>When the dragon saw he’d been thrown down to earth, he persecuted the woman that had given birth to the male <em>child</em>. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>She received the two wings of a giant eagle so she could fly into the wilderness away from the dragon and be sustained</span>

### ½ times. 15The dragon spewed a river out of its mouth to sweep the woman away in a flood, 16but the earth helped her and opened its mouth and drank up the river. 17The dragon raged over the woman and went away to fight her other offspring that keep God’s commands and have the message about Jesus.
