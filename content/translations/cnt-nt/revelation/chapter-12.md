## Revelation Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> An important sign appeared in the sky, a woman dressed in the sun with the moon under her feet and twelve crowns on her head. 2She was pregnant and cried out in labor, straining to give birth. 3Another sign appeared in the sky, a big red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven diadems on its heads. 4Its tail dragged down a third of the stars and threw them onto earth. It stood in front of the woman, ready to devour her child. 5She had a Son that would rule the nations with an iron rod. He was snatched up to God and his throne, and 6the woman ran into the desert. God had prepared a place there for people to sustain her 1260 days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> War broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels battling the dragon and his angels. 8The dragon wasn't powerful enough, and he and his angels no longer had a place in heaven. 9The great dragon was thrown out, the old serpent, the devil, Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He and his angels were thrown down to earth. 10I heard a loud voice in heaven,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They triumphed over their accuser</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So celebrate, heaven, and you that tabernacle there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When the dragon saw he'd been thrown down to earth, he persecuted the woman that had given birth to the male child. 14She received the two wings of a giant eagle so she could fly into the wilderness away from the dragon and be sustained for 3½ times. 15The dragon spewed a river out of its mouth to sweep the woman away in a flood, 16but the earth helped her and opened its mouth and drank up the river. 17The dragon raged over the woman and went away to fight her other offspring that keep God's commands and have the message about Jesus.</span>
