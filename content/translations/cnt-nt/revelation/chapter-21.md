## Revelation Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I saw a new earth and sky. The first earth and sky had passed away, and there wasn’t any ocean anymore. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I watched the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, come down out of heaven from God, ready like a bride adorned for her husband. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A loud voice came from the throne, <em>“God’s tabernacle is with </em><em>his people</em><em>; he’ll live with them, and they’ll </em><em>belong to him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> </em><em>wipe away every tear, and there won’t be any</em><em> </em><em>pain, </em><em>weeping, crying, </em><em>or death</em><em> anymore.</em><em> </em><em>Former things will pass away.”</em><em>	 </em><strong>Rev 21:1-4</strong><em>                           </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The One on the throne said, <em>“I’m making everything new.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Write</em><em> this down because </em><em>it’s</em><em> </em><em>true and reliable</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>It’s done.</em><em> </em><em>I’m Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll let whoever’s thirsty drink from the spring of living water free of charge.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Th</em><em>ose</em><em> who</em><em> </em><em>overcome</em><em> will inherit these things.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll be </em><em>their</em><em> God, and </em><em>they</em><em>’ll be my </em><em>children</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> the unfaithful</em><em> and</em><em> corrupt, </em><em>the </em><em>cowards, murderers, </em><em>sorcerers, idolaters, </em><em>liars, and</em><em> immoral will bu</em><em>rn in the lake of sulf</em><em>ur, which is the second death.”</em><em>                                                       </em><em>	</em><strong>Rev 21:5-8</strong> <strong>The New</strong><strong> Jerusalem</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>One of the angels with the seven bowls of final plagues came to me, <em>“Come</em><em> with me</em><em>; I’ll show you the Lamb’s bride.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He took me in spirit to a big, tall mountain and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>shining with God’s glory. Its brilliance was like a very valuable stone, like crystal-clear jasper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> It had a broad, high wall and twelve gates, with an angel at each gate and the names of Israel’s twelve tribes inscribed on them. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>There were three gates each on the east, north, south, and west. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The wall consisted of twelve foundations with the names of the Lamb’s twelve apostles on them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 21:9-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The <em>angel</em> that was talking to me had a gold rod for measuring the city, its gates, and wall. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The city was shaped like a cube 1380 miles long, wide, and high; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>its wall measured 216 feet high, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>made out of jasper; the city was pure gold like clear glass. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The foundation stones were beautiful precious stones. In order, they were jasper, sapphire, agate, emerald, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>sardonyx, carnelian*, chrysolite* <em>[yellow topaz]</em>, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase* <em>[green quartz]</em>, hyacinth, and amethyst. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Each gate was a single pearl, and the streets were pure gold like transparent glass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I didn’t see a sanctuary in it because God Almighty and the Lamb were its sanctuary. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The city didn’t need the sun or moon because God’s glory gave it light, and the Lamb was its lamp. <strong><sup>24, </sup></strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The nations lived by its light, and kings brought their glory and the honor of their nations into it. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Its gates never shut because there wasn’t any night there. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Nothing profane or anyone detestable or false could go in, only the ones written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.</span>
