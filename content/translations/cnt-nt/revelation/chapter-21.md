## Revelation Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I saw a new earth and sky. The first earth and sky had passed away, and there wasn't any ocean anymore. 2I watched the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, come down out of heaven from God, ready like a bride adorned for her husband. 3A loud voice came from the throne, "God's tabernacle is with his people; he'll live with them, and they'll belong to him. 4He'll wipe away every tear, and there won't be any pain, weeping, crying, or death anymore. Former things will pass away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The One on the throne said, "I'm making everything new. 6Write this down because it's true and reliable. It's done. I'm Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end. I'll let whoever's thirsty drink from the spring of living water free of charge. 7Those who overcome will inherit these things. I'll be their God, and they'll be my children. 8But the unfaithful and corrupt, the cowards, murderers, sorcerers, idolaters, liars, and immoral will burn in the lake of sulfur, which is the second death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> One of the angels with the seven bowls of final plagues came to me, "Come with me; I'll show you the Lamb's bride." 10He took me in spirit to a big, tall mountain and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 11shining with God's glory. Its brilliance was like a very valuable stone, like crystal-clear jasper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> It had a broad, high wall and twelve gates, with an angel at each gate and the names of Israel's twelve tribes inscribed on them. 13There were three gates each on the east, north, south, and west. 14The wall consisted of twelve foundations with the names of the Lamb's twelve apostles on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The angel that was talking to me had a gold rod for measuring the city, its gates, and wall. 16The city was shaped like a cube 1380 miles long, wide, and high; 17its wall measured 216 feet high, 18made out of jasper; the city was pure gold like clear glass. 19The foundation stones were beautiful precious stones. In order, they were jasper, sapphire, agate, emerald, 20sardonyx, carnelian*, chrysolite* [yellow topaz], beryl, topaz, chrysoprase* [green quartz], hyacinth, and amethyst. 21Each gate was a single pearl, and the streets were pure gold like transparent glass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I didn't see a sanctuary in it because God Almighty and the Lamb were its sanctuary. 23The city didn't need the sun or moon because God's glory gave it light, and the Lamb was its lamp. 24, 26The nations lived by its light, and kings brought their glory and the honor of their nations into it. 25Its gates never shut because there wasn't any night there. 27Nothing profane or anyone detestable or false could go in, only the ones written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</span>
