## Revelation Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>“Write</em><em> this to the evangelist for</em><em> the church in Ephesus:</em> <em>	‘This is what he says who </em><em>holds the seven stars in his right hand </em><em>and </em><em>walks among the seven gold lampstands</em><em>:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> know what you’re doing</em><em>—your labor and endurance. I know you can’t put up with sinful people. You’ve tested those who called themselves apostles and </em><em>weren’t, and</em><em> found them false. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> endured for me without wearing out.                             </em><em>	     </em><em>	</em><em>	          </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><em>But</em><em> you’ve slacked off </em><em>from </em><em>the level of love you had at first.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> remember where you’</em><em>ve </em><em>come down</em><em> from, repent, and do what you were </em><em>doing at</em><em> first.</em><em> </em><em>Otherwise, I’ll come and </em><em>take</em><em> your lampstand</em><em> away</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>To</em><em> your credit, like me, you hate what the Nicolaitans do.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><em>Whoever</em><em> has an ear, listen to what the Spirit’s telling the churches. </em><em>Those who are victorious I’ll let eat from the tree of life in Paradise.”’”    </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 2:1-7</p>

### The Letter to Smyrna 	8“Write this to the evangelist for the church in Smyrna: 		‘This is what the First and Last says, who died and came back to life: 9“I know your hardship and poverty (but you’re rich) and the slander of those who call themselves Jews but belong to Satan’s synagogue. 10Don’t be afraid of what you’re going to suffer. The devil will throw some of you in jail to test you. You’ll have hardship for ten days.  Be faithful till death, and I’ll give you life as a crown.


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup><em>Whoever</em><em> has an ear, listen to what the Spirit’s telling the churches</em><em>. </em><em>Those who are victorious won’t suffer the second death.”’”  </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 2:8-11</p>

### The Letter to Pergamum 	12“Write this to the evangelist for the church in Pergamum: 		‘This is what he says who has the sharp two-edged sword: 13“I know you live where Satan’s throne is. You’ve held fast to me and haven’t denied faith in me, even when Antipas my faithful witness was executed among you, where Satan lives.


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><em>But</em><em> I do have some things against you.</em><em> </em><em>You have </em><em>people</em><em> </em><em>that are</em><em> </em><em>following</em><em> the teaching of Balaam, who </em><em>showed</em><em> Balak </em><em>how </em><em>to </em><em>make</em><em> the Israelites</em><em> stumble—by</em><em> eat</em><em>ing</em><em> things sacrif</em><em>iced to idols</em><em> and</em><em> doing</em><em> </em><em>immoral things</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> also have </em><em>people</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> hold to </em><em>what the</em><em> Nicolaitans</em><em> teach</em><em>.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> repent; otherwise</em><em>,</em><em> I’ll come quickly and fight them with the sword </em><em>that’s </em><em>in my mouth.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><em>Whoever</em><em> has an ear, listen to what the Spirit’s telling the churches. </em><em>Those who are victorious I’ll supply with hidden manna and give them a white stone inscribed with a new name that nobody knows but him.”’”    </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 2:12-17</p>

### The Letter to Thyatira 	18“Write this to the evangelist for the church in Thyatira: 	‘This is what the Son of God says, who has eyes like flames and feet like refined, polished brass: 19“I know what you’re doing—your love, faith, service, and endurance, and that your last works are greater than the first.


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>But</em><em>, I have against you that you’ve allowed Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach my servants to </em><em>do immoral</em><em> </em><em>things</em><em> and eat things offered to idols. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> gave her time to repent, but she didn’t want to.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><strong><sup>-23</sup></strong><em>Unless they repent of her </em><em>deeds,</em><em> I’ll throw them and her in</em><em>to a bed with a</em><em> </em><em>terminal plague. I’ll certainly kill her offspring, and all the churches will know that I examine minds and hearts</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll </em><em>give to each according to </em><em>what they’ve done</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> rest of you in Thyatira—</em><em>who</em><em> don’t have</em><em> that teaching, who don’t know </em><em>‘the deep things of Satan,’</em><em> as they call them</em><em>—I won’t burden with anything </em><em>else. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>J</em><em>ust</em><em> hold on</em><em> to what you have till I come.  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><em>Those</em><em> who are victorious and keep my deeds to the end, I’ll give authority over the nations. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> shepherd them with an iron rod and shatter them like clay pots. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> I received from my </em><em>Father,</em><em> I’ll give them the morning star. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup><em>Whoever</em><em> has an ear, listen to what the Spirit’s telling the churches.”’” </em> <em>                                            </em><em>	  </em></span>
