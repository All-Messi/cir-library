## Revelation Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Write this to the evangelist for the church in Ephesus: 'This is what he says who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold lampstands: 2"I know what you're doing—your labor and endurance. I know you can't put up with sinful people. You've tested those who called themselves apostles and weren't, and found them false. 3You've endured for me without wearing out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But you've slacked off from the level of love you had at first.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So remember where you've come down from, repent, and do what you were doing at first. Otherwise, I'll come and take your lampstand away. 6To your credit, like me, you hate what the Nicolaitans do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Whoever has an ear, listen to what the Spirit's telling the churches. Those who are victorious I'll let eat from the tree of life in Paradise."'" 'This is what the First and Last says, who died and came back to life: 9"I know your hardship and poverty (but you're rich) and the slander of those who call themselves Jews but belong to Satan's synagogue. 10Don't be afraid of what you're going to suffer. The devil will throw some of you in jail to test you. You'll have hardship for ten days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Whoever has an ear, listen to what the Spirit's telling the churches. Those who are victorious won't suffer the second death."'" 'This is what he says who has the sharp two-edged sword: 13"I know you live where Satan's throne is. You've held fast to me and haven't denied faith in me, even when Antipas my faithful witness was executed among you, where Satan lives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But I do have some things against you. You have people that are following the teaching of Balaam, who showed Balak how to make the Israelites stumble—by eating things sacrificed to idols and doing immoral things. 15You also have people that hold to what the Nicolaitans teach.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So repent; otherwise, I'll come quickly and fight them with the sword that's in my mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Whoever has an ear, listen to what the Spirit's telling the churches. Those who are victorious I'll supply with hidden manna and give them a white stone inscribed with a new name that nobody knows but him."'" 'This is what the Son of God says, who has eyes like flames and feet like refined, polished brass: 19"I know what you're doing—your love, faith, service, and endurance, and that your last works are greater than the first.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But, I have against you that you've allowed Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach my servants to do immoral things and eat things offered to idols. 21I gave her time to repent, but she didn't want to. 22-23Unless they repent of her deeds, I'll throw them and her into a bed with a terminal plague. I'll certainly kill her offspring, and all the churches will know that I examine minds and hearts. I'll give to each according to what they've done. 24The rest of you in Thyatira—who don't have that teaching, who don't know 'the deep things of Satan,' as they call them—I won't burden with anything else. 25Just hold on to what you have till I come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Those who are victorious and keep my deeds to the end, I'll give authority over the nations. 27He'll shepherd them with an iron rod and shatter them like clay pots. 28As I received from my Father, I'll give them the morning star.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Whoever has an ear, listen to what the Spirit's telling the churches."'"</span>
