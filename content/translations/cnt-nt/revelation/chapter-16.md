## Revelation Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary, telling the seven angels, <em>“Pour out the </em><em>seven</em><em> bowls of God’s </em><em>anger</em><em> on the earth.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The first poured out his bowl on the <u>land</u>. A foul, painful boil festered up on the ones that had the stamp of the beast and worshiped its image.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The second poured out his bowl on the <u>ocean</u>. It became like dead men’s blood. Everything in the ocean died.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 16:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The third poured out his bowl on <u>rivers and springs</u>. They became blood. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>I heard that angel say, <em>“You’</em><em>re just, Holy One, who are and were, </em> <em>for</em><em> </em><em>decreeing tho</em><em>se judgments.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>Because</em><em> they poured out the blood of saints and prophets,</em> <em>	y</em><em>ou’ve given them blood to drink.</em> <em>	That’s what they deserve</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I heard the altar say, <em>“Yes, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God </em><em>Almighty;</em> <em>	</em><em>y</em><em>our judgments are true and just.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em><strong>Rev 16:4-7</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the <u>sun</u>, and it scorched people <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>with searing heat. They blasphemed God, who authorized those plagues; and they didn’t repent or praise him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the <u>throne of the beast</u>. Its kingdom grew dark, and people gnawed their tongues in agony. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They blasphemed God in their agony and sores, but they didn’t repent.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 16:8-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the big <u>Euphrates River</u>. It dried up so the kings in the East could cross it. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I saw three unclean spirits <em>leap </em>like frogs out of the mouths of the dragon, beast, and false prophet. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They were demons that performed signs, and they went to gather the kings of the world for war at the great day of God Almighty. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“I’m</em><em> coming like a thief at night.</em><em> </em><em>Blessed </em><em>are</em><em> </em><em>those who</em><em> stay awake </em><em>and dressed</em><em> so </em><em>they</em><em> won’t be walking </em><em>around </em><em>naked</em><em>,</em><em> and people see </em><em>their</em><em> shame.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He gathered them to a place called in Hebrew The Mound of Megiddo <em>[Harmagedon]</em>*<em>.   </em><em>	</em><strong>Rev 16:12-16</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The seventh <em>angel </em>poured out his bowl on the <u>air</u>. A voice shouted out of the sanctuary from the throne, <em>“It’s finished!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>There came lightning flashes, peals of thunder, and the most severe earthquake in history. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The great city <em>‘Babylon’ </em>split into three parts, and the cities in the nations crumbled. God remembered to give ‘Babylon’ the Great his wine cup of fierce fury. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The islands sank, and the mountains collapsed. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Enormous hailstones, weighing over 90 pounds, fell on people. They blasphemed God because the hailstone plague was so severe. <strong>Rev 16:17-21</strong></span>
