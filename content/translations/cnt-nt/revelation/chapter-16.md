## Revelation Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary, telling the seven angels, "Pour out the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The first poured out his bowl on the land. A foul, painful boil festered up on the ones that had the stamp of the beast and worshiped its image.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The second poured out his bowl on the ocean. It became like dead men's blood. Everything in the ocean died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The third poured out his bowl on rivers and springs. They became blood. 5I heard that angel say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Because they poured out the blood of saints and prophets,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I heard the altar say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it scorched people 9with searing heat. They blasphemed God, who authorized those plagues; and they didn't repent or praise him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast. Its kingdom grew dark, and people gnawed their tongues in agony. 11They blasphemed God in their agony and sores, but they didn't repent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the big Euphrates River. It dried up so the kings in the East could cross it. 13I saw three unclean spirits leap like frogs out of the mouths of the dragon, beast, and false prophet. 14They were demons that performed signs, and they went to gather the kings of the world for war at the great day of God Almighty. 15"I'm coming like a thief at night. Blessed are those who stay awake and dressed so they won't be walking around naked, and people see their shame." 16He gathered them to a place called in Hebrew The Mound of Megiddo [Harmagedon]*.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The seventh angel poured out his bowl on the air. A voice shouted out of the sanctuary from the throne, "It's finished!" 18There came lightning flashes, peals of thunder, and the most severe earthquake in history. 19The great city 'Babylon' split into three parts, and the cities in the nations crumbled. God remembered to give 'Babylon' the Great his wine cup of fierce fury. 20The islands sank, and the mountains collapsed. 21Enormous hailstones, weighing over 90 pounds, fell on people. They blasphemed God because the hailstone plague was so severe.</span>
