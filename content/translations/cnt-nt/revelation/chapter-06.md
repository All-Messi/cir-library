## Revelation Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When I saw the Lamb break the first seal, I heard one living being say like thunder, <em>“Come.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>A white horse <em>came out</em>; its rider had a bow. He received a crown and went out to conquer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When <em>the Lamb</em> broke the second seal, the second living being said, <em>“Come.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A fiery red horse came out. Its rider was allowed to take peace away from the earth so people would kill each other. He received a large sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When <em>the Lamb</em> broke the third seal, the third living being said, <em>“Come.”</em> A black horse <em>came out</em>. Its rider was holding a balance scales. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I heard a voice from among the four living beings, <em>“A quart of wheat for a day’s </em><em>pay</em><em>;</em><em> three quarts of barley for a day’s </em><em>pay</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Use oil and wine sparingly.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When <em>the Lamb</em> broke the fourth seal, the fourth living being said, <em>“Come.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>A pale green horse <em>came out</em>. Its rider was named Death; Grave followed him. They received control over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, death, and wild animals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When <em>the Lamb</em> broke the fifth seal, under the altar I saw the souls of people that had been martyred for the message of God that they had. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They cried out, <em>“How long, Master, holy and true, before you avenge our blood on</em><em> the people</em><em> living on earth?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He gave each one a white robe and told them to rest a little longer till their fellow martyrs fulfill their course. <strong>Rev 6:9-11</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When I saw <em>the Lamb</em> break the sixth seal, there was a major earthquake. The sun got as dark as burlap made of hair, and the whole moon looked like blood. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Stars fell to earth like unripe figs in a strong wind. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The sky separated like a scroll being unrolled, and every mountain and island quaked. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The kings on earth, the elite, the commanders of 1,000 <em>[chiliarchs]</em>, the rich, the powerful, servants and freemen hid in caves and mountain rocks. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They said to the mountains and rocks, <em>“</em><em>Bring an avalanche over</em><em> us and hide us from the One on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> time</em><em> </em><em>for </em><em>their </em><em>great </em><em>fury has come.</em><em> </em><em>Who can s</em><em>urvive</em><em> it?”</em> <em>             </em><em>	</em><strong>Rev 6:12-17</strong> <strong>Sealing the 144,000</strong></span>
