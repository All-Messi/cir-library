## Revelation Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When I saw the Lamb break the first seal, I heard one living being say like thunder, "Come." 2A white horse came out; its rider had a bow. He received a crown and went out to conquer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When the Lamb broke the second seal, the second living being said, "Come." 4A fiery red horse came out. Its rider was allowed to take peace away from the earth so people would kill each other. He received a large sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When the Lamb broke the third seal, the third living being said, "Come." A black horse came out. Its rider was holding a balance scales. 6I heard a voice from among the four living beings, "A quart of wheat for a day's pay; three quarts of barley for a day's pay. Use oil and wine sparingly."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, the fourth living being said, "Come." 8A pale green horse came out. Its rider was named Death; Grave followed him. They received control over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, death, and wild animals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, under the altar I saw the souls of people that had been martyred for the message of God that they had. 10They cried out, "How long, Master, holy and true, before you avenge our blood on the people living on earth?" 11He gave each one a white robe and told them to rest a little longer till their fellow martyrs fulfill their course.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, there was a major earthquake. The sun got as dark as burlap made of hair, and the whole moon looked like blood. 13Stars fell to earth like unripe figs in a strong wind. 14The sky separated like a scroll being unrolled, and every mountain and island quaked. 15The kings on earth, the elite, the commanders of 1,000 [chiliarchs], the rich, the powerful, servants and freemen hid in caves and mountain rocks. 16They said to the mountains and rocks, "Bring an avalanche over us and hide us from the One on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb. 17The time for their great fury has come. Who can survive it?"</span>
