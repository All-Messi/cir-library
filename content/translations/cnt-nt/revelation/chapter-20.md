Their number will be like the sand on the seashore. 9They’ll come up on the plain of the earth and surround the camp of the saints and the dearly loved city; fire will come from the sky and consume them. 10The devil will be thrown into the burning lake of sulfur, where the beast and false prophet have been. They’ll be tormented day and night forevermore. 	Rev 20:7-10 The Great White-Throne Judgment


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>I saw a large white throne and the One that was sitting on it. Earth and sky fled from him; they were no longer there. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I saw the dead, from least to greatest, standing in front of the throne, and the books were opened. Another book was opened, <em>the Book</em> of Life; and the dead were judged by their deeds written in the books. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The sea, death, and the grave gave up their dead. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Death and the grave were thrown into the burning lake, which is the second death. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Anybody that wasn’t in the Book of Life was thrown into the burning lake.</span>
