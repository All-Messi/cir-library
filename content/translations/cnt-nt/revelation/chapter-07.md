They were keeping the four winds from blowing on the land, sea, and trees. 2I watched another angel come down from the east with the seal of the living God. He shouted to the four angels that could harm the land and sea, 3"Don't harm the land, sea, or trees till we seal our God's servants on their foreheads!" 4I heard the number that were sealed: 144,000—from every tribe of Israel; 12,000 each 5from Judah, Reuben, Gad, 6Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, 7Simeon, Levi, Issachar, 8Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin.</span>
