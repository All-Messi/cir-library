## Revelation Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the world. They were keeping the four winds from blowing on the land, sea, and trees. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I watched another angel come down from the east with the seal of the living God. He shouted to the four angels that could harm the land and sea, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Don’t</em><em> harm the land, sea, </em><em>or</em><em> trees till we seal </em><em>our God’s</em><em> servant</em><em>s on their foreheads!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I heard the number that were sealed: 144,000—from every tribe of Israel; 12,000 each <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>from Judah, Reuben, Gad, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Simeon, Levi, Issachar, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin.</span>

### The Great Host in White Robes


<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>After that, I saw a tremendous host nobody could count, from every nation, tribe, people group, and language, standing in front of the throne and the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and holding palm branches. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They shouted, <em>“Salvation to our God who sits</em><em> </em><em>on the throne</em><em>,</em><em> </em> <em>and to the Lamb!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> All the angels around the throne, the elders, and the living beings fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>One of the elders asked me, <em>“Who are th</em><em>e ones</em><em> in white robes?</em><em> </em><em>Where’d they come from?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I said, <em>“</em><em>Sir</em><em>, you know.”</em> He said, <em>“They ca</em><em>me through the great </em><em>ordeal</em><em> and washed their robes to make them white in the blood of the Lamb.</em></span>
