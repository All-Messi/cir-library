## Revelation Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I saw another great, amazing sign: seven angels that had the seven last plagues. With them God will finish his anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I saw what looked like a glass sea mixed with fire. Those who were victorious over the beast, its image, and the number of its name, stood on the glass sea, holding harps God gave them 3and singing the Song of Moses, God's servant, and the Song of the Lamb:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who won't respect you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> After that, I saw in heaven the open sanctuary in the tabernacle of testimony. 6Seven angels with the seven last plagues came out of the sanctuary dressed in clean, bright linen with gold sashes across their chests. 7One of the four living beings gave the seven angels gold bowls full of the eternal God's anger. 8Smoke from God's glory and power filled the sanctuary. Nobody could go into it till the seven plagues were over.</span>
