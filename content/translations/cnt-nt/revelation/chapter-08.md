## Revelation Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, heaven was silent for about a half hour. 2I saw seven angels standing in front of God, receiving seven trumpets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Another angel came and stood by the altar, holding a gold censer. He received a large amount incense to add to the prayers of the saints on the gold altar in front of the throne. 4The smoke from the incense rose up from the angel's hand with the saints' prayers. 5The angel filled the censer with fire from the altar and threw it onto the earth. There came peals of thunder, lightning flashes, and an earthquake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The seven angels with the seven trumpets raised them to blow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The first blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown onto the earth. A third of the earth, a third of the trees, and all the green grass burned up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The second angel blew his trumpet. Something like a burning mountain was thrown into the ocean and turned a third of it to blood, 9killed a third of marine life, and destroyed a third of the ships that were on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The third angel blew his trumpet. A big star, burning like a torch, fell on a third of the springs and rivers. 11It's name was Wormwood. A third of the water turned bitter, and many people died from the brackish water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun, moon, and stars was struck. A third of the stars went out; the sun didn't shine for a third of the day, and the moon didn't shine for a third of the night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I saw and heard an eagle flying in the sky, shouting, "Woe, woe, woe to people on earth because of the last three trumpet blasts!"</span>
