## Revelation Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When <em>the Lamb</em> broke the seventh seal, heaven was silent for about a half hour. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I saw seven angels standing in front of God, receiving seven trumpets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Another angel came and stood by the altar, holding a gold censer. He received a large amount incense to add to the prayers of the saints on the gold altar in front of the throne. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The smoke from the incense rose up from the angel’s hand with the saints’ prayers. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The angel filled the censer with fire from the altar and threw it onto the earth. There came peals of thunder, lightning flashes, and an earthquake.</span>

### Blowing the 7 Trumpets


<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The seven angels with the seven trumpets raised them to blow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The first blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown onto the earth. A third of the earth, a third of the trees, and all the green grass burned up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The second angel blew his trumpet. Something like a burning mountain was thrown into the ocean and turned a third of it to blood, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>killed a third of marine life, and destroyed a third of the ships <em>that were on it</em>.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 8:6-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The third angel blew his trumpet. A big star, burning like a torch, fell on a third of the springs and rivers. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>It’s name was Wormwood. A third of the water turned bitter, and many people died from the brackish water.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 8:10-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun, moon, and stars was struck. A third of the stars went out; the sun didn’t shine for a third of the day, and the moon didn’t shine for a third of the night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I saw and heard an eagle flying in the sky, shouting, <em>“Woe, woe, woe to people</em><em> on earth because of the last </em><em>three trumpet blasts!”  </em><em>	 </em><strong>Rev 8:12-13</strong> <strong>The Fifth Trumpet/The First Woe</strong></span>
