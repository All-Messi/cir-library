## Revelation Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One on the throne. It had writing inside and out, and seven seals on it. 2A strong angel shouted, "Who's worthy to break the seven seals and unroll the scroll?" 3Nobody in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could unroll it—or even look at it. 4I started to cry because nobody could unroll it. 5One of the elders said, "Don't cry. The Lion from the tribe of Judah, David's descendant, has overcome death. He can break the seven seals and unroll it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Among the throne, elders, and four living beings, I saw a Lamb standing as if it had been slain. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits God sent into the whole world. 7He came and took the scroll from the One on the throne. 8Then the four living beings and 24 elders knelt in front of the Lamb. Each one had a harp and a gold bowl of incense, which is the saints' prayers. 9They sang a new song,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You made them into a kingdom of priests for our God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I saw countless thousands of angels around the throne, created beings, and elders, shouting,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Everyone created in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The four living beings said, "Amen," and the elders knelt down in worship.</span>
