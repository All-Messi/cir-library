## Revelation Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One on the throne. It had writing inside and out, and seven seals on it. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>A strong angel shouted, <em>“Who’s worthy to break the </em><em>seven</em><em> seals and </em><em>unroll</em><em> the</em><em> scroll</em><em>?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Nobody in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could unroll it—or <em>even </em>look at it. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I started to cry because nobody could unroll it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>One of the elders said, <em>“Don’t cry.</em><em> </em><em>The Lion from the tribe of Judah, David</em><em>’s descendant</em><em>, has overcome </em>death. He<em> can</em><em> break the </em><em>seven</em><em> seals and </em><em>unroll</em><em> it.”</em><strong>     </strong><strong></span>

### Worshipping the Lamb


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Among the throne, elders, and four living beings, I saw a Lamb standing as if it had been slain. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits God sent into the whole world. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He came and took the scroll from the One on the throne. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then the four living beings and 24 elders knelt in front of the Lamb. Each one had a harp and a gold bowl of incense, which is the saints’ prayers. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They sang a new song, <em>“You’re worthy to take the </em><em>scroll </em><em>and break its seals</em> <em>	</em><em> </em><em>because you were </em><em>killed.</em><em> </em> <em>W</em><em>ith your blood</em><em> you</em><em> purchased for God</em> <em>	</em><em>	people </em><em>out of</em><em> every trib</em><em>e, language, people group, and nation. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> made</em><em> them into a kingdom of priests </em><em>for our God,</em> <em>	and they’ll rule on earth.”</em><em>  </em><em>	</em><strong>Rev 5:6-10</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I saw countless thousands of angels around the throne, created beings, and elders, shouting,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Everyone created in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea said, <em>“To the One on the throne and to the Lamb,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	blessing, honor, glory, and </em><em>power</em><em> forever</em><em>more</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The four living beings said, <em>“Amen,”</em> and the elders knelt down in worship.</span>
