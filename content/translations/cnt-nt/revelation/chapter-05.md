## Revelation Chapter **5**

### elders knelt in front of the Lamb. Each one had a harp and a gold bowl of incense, which is the saints’ prayers. 9They sang a new song, “You’re worthy to take the scroll and break its seals 	 because you were killed.  With your blood you purchased for God 		people out of every tribe, language, people group, and nation.


<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> made</em><em> them into a kingdom of priests </em><em>for our God,</em> <em>	and they’ll rule on earth.”</em><em>  </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Rev 5:6-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I saw countless thousands of angels around the throne, created beings, and elders, shouting, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“The</em><em> Lamb that was </em><em>killed deserves</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	to receive </em><em>authority</em><em>, wealth, wisdom,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	stren</em><em>gth, honor, glory, and blessing!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Everyone created in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea said, <em>“To the One on the throne and to the Lamb,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	blessing, honor, glory, and </em><em>power</em><em> forever</em><em>more</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>The four living beings said, <em>“Amen,”</em> and the elders knelt down in worship.</span>
