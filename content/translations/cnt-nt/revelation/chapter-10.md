## Revelation Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I watched another powerful angel come down from the sky, dressed in a cloud with a rainbow above his head. His face shined like the sun, and his legs were like pillars of fire. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He was holding a little, open scroll in his right hand. With his right foot on the sea and his left one on land, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>he shouted like a roaring lion. When he shouted, seven thunders pealed. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they did, I was about to write, but a voice from the sky said, <em>“Seal up what the </em><em>seven</em><em> thunders said; don’t write </em><em>it</em><em> down.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The angel that was standing on land and sea, lifted his right hand toward the sky <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and swore by the One who lives forevermore—who created earth, sky, sea, and everything in them—that there wouldn’t be any more delay. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When it’s time for the seventh angel to blow his trumpet, God’s unrevealed plan will come to completion like he’d told his servants the prophets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The voice from the sky spoke to me again, <em>“Go take the little</em><em>,</em><em> open </em><em>scroll</em><em> </em><em>that’s </em><em>in the hand of the angel </em><em>that’s </em><em>standing on </em><em>land</em><em> and</em><em> sea</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I went and asked him for it. He said, <em>“Eat it</em><em>; it’ll make your stomach </em><em>sour</em><em>, but it’ll leave a sweet taste in your mouth.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I took it and ate it. It tasted sweet like honey; but when I swallowed it, it made my stomach sour. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They told me, <em>“You </em><em>have to prophesy some more to many people</em><em> group</em><em>s, nations, languages, and kings.</em><em>”                                                 </em><em>	       </em><strong>Rev 10:8-11</strong><em>              </em> <strong>The Two Witnesses</strong></span>
