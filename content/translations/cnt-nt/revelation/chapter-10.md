## Revelation Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I watched another powerful angel come down from the sky, dressed in a cloud with a rainbow above his head. His face shined like the sun, and his legs were like pillars of fire. 2He was holding a little, open scroll in his right hand. With his right foot on the sea and his left one on land, 3he shouted like a roaring lion. When he shouted, seven thunders pealed. 4When they did, I was about to write, but a voice from the sky said, "Seal up what the seven thunders said; don't write it down." 5The angel that was standing on land and sea, lifted his right hand toward the sky 6and swore by the One who lives forevermore—who created earth, sky, sea, and everything in them—that there wouldn't be any more delay. 7When it's time for the seventh angel to blow his trumpet, God's unrevealed plan will come to completion like he'd told his servants the prophets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The voice from the sky spoke to me again, "Go take the little, open scroll that's in the hand of the angel that's standing on land and sea." 9I went and asked him for it. He said, "Eat it; it'll make your stomach sour, but it'll leave a sweet taste in your mouth." 10I took it and ate it. It tasted sweet like honey; but when I swallowed it, it made my stomach sour. 11They told me, "You have to prophesy some more to many people groups, nations, languages, and kings."</span>
