## Revelation Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The angel showed me a crystal-clear river of life flowing from the throne of God and the Lamb. 2Between the city street and the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit and growing leaves that heal the nations. 3There won't be any more curse. The throne of God and the Lamb will be in that city, and his servants will worship him. 4They'll see his face and have his name on their foreheads. 5There won't be any night; they won't need a lamp or the sun because God will give them light, and they'll reign forevermore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The angel said, "What you've seen and heard is true and trustworthy. The LORD God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show his servants what needs to happen soon. 7'I'm coming soon. Blessed are those who keep the prophecy that's in this book.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I, John, heard and saw those things. When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship the angel that was showing them to me. 9But he said, "Don't do that. I'm a fellow servant with your brothers the prophets and the people that keep the message in this book. Worship God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let the unrighteous stay unrighteous; 12"I'm coming soon. I'll bring with me the reward for each person according to what they've done. 13I'm Alpha and Omega, the First and Last, the beginning and end."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Blessed are those who wash their robes so they'll have a right to the tree of life and a right to go into the city through its gates. 15Outside are dogs, sorcerers, immoral people, murderers, idolaters, and everybody that enjoys telling and doing something false. 16"I, Jesus, sent my angel to tell youpl these things for the churches. I'm the root and offspring of David, the bright morning star."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." Let the one that hears it say, "Come." Let the thirsty come and drink the water of life free of charge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I say to everybody that hears the prophecy in this book: if you add to it, God will add to you the plagues in this book. 19If you take anything away from it, he will take away your part from the tree of life and the Holy City in this book.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The One that's telling you these things says, "Yes, I'm coming soon."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all. 	Rev.</span>
