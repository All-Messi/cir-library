### Gratitude for the Thessalonians


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>We’re always obliged to thank God for you because your faith is growing so much and your love for one another keeps increasing. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>As a result, among the churches, we say how proud we are of you because of your faith despite the persecution and hardships you’re dealing with. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Those</em><em> hardships</em> show that in God’s just judgment you’re worthy of his kingdom you’re suffering for. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He will be just when he pays back trouble to the ones that are giving you trouble, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and in paying back relief to you that face trouble along with us. That vengeance will come when the Lord Jesus returns from heaven with his powerful angels <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>in flaming fire. He’ll take revenge on people that don’t know God or obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They’ll undergo permanent destruction away from his presence and glorious power. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That’ll</em><em> be </em>the day when he comes, and you saints can praise him and be amazed at him because you believed our testimony. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So we always pray for you, too, that our God will count you worthy of <em>his</em> calling and powerfully fulfill every good intention and faithful work. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>That way you’ll praise the Lord Jesus, and he’ll praise you in proportion to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
