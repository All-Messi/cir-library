## 2 Thessalonians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristMessiah. 2Grace and peace from God [our]ms Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> We're always obliged to thank God for you because your faith is growing so much and your love for one another keeps increasing. 4As a result, among the churches, we say how proud we are of you because of your faith despite the persecution and hardships you're dealing with. 5Those hardships show that in God's just judgment you're worthy of his kingdom you're suffering for. 6He will be just when he pays back trouble to the ones that are giving you trouble, 7and in paying back relief to you that face trouble along with us. That vengeance will come when the Lord Jesus returns from heaven with his powerful angels 8in flaming fire. He'll take revenge on people that don't know God or obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. 9They'll undergo permanent destruction away from his presence and glorious power. 10That'll be the day when he comes, and you saints can praise him and be amazed at him because you believed our testimony. 11So we always pray for you, too, that our God will count you worthy of his calling and powerfully fulfill every good intention and faithful work. 12That way you'll praise the Lord Jesus, and he'll praise you in proportion to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
