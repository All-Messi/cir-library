## 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now, about our Lord’s return and our gathering to him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Don’t let a spirit, a message, a letter claiming to be from us disturb you if it says it’s time for the Lord to return. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He won’t return till apostasy occurs and “the lawless one” appears. That “one destined for destruction” <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>will oppose <em>God</em> and exalt himself above everything that’s called deity or is worshiped. He’ll seat himself in God’s Temple and claim to be deity. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You remember me telling you that, don’t you, while I was there? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>You know what’s holding <em>him</em> back for now—till he’s revealed in his time. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>That secret lawlessness is already at work, but the one that’s holding <em>him</em> back now <em>will continue to do so</em> till he’s gone. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then “the lawless one” will appear, the one the Lord will kill with his breath and destroy at his return. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The <em>lawless one’s</em> coming will be like Satan’s working: with power, signs, false wonders, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and every sinful deception, all aimed at people that perish, people that haven’t welcomed a love for the truth so they’d be saved. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So God will send them a deluding influence to cause them to believe a lie. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Then</em> the truth will judge disbelievers who delight in doing wrong.</span>

### God’s Choice of the Thessalonians


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <u>We</u>’re always obliged to thank God for you, family of Christ the Lord loves, because God chose you to be the firstfruits of salvation by believing the truth and by the holiness the Spirit brings. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He called you to that <em>truth</em> by the good news we delivered, which is for obtaining the honor our Lord Jesus Christ has. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>So, stand firm; hold onto the traditions we taught you by word and letter. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father—who loved us and gave <em>us</em> eternal comfort and good hope in grace—<strong><sup>17</sup></strong>comfort you and strengthen <em>you</em> in every good thing you do and say.</span>
