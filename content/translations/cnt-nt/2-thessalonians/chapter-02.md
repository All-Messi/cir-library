## 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now, about our Lord's return and our gathering to him. 2Don't let a spirit, a message, a letter claiming to be from us disturb you if it says it's time for the Lord to return. 3He won't return till apostasy occurs and "the lawless one" appears. That "one destined for destruction" 4will oppose God and exalt himself above everything that's called deity or is worshiped. He'll seat himself in God's Temple and claim to be deity. 5You remember me telling you that, don't you, while I was there? 6You know what's holding him back for now—till he's revealed in his time. 7That secret lawlessness is already at work, but the one that's holding him back now will continue to do so till he's gone. 8Then "the lawless one" will appear, the one the Lord will kill with his breath and destroy at his return. 9The lawless one's coming will be like Satan's working: with power, signs, false wonders, 10and every sinful deception, all aimed at people that perish, people that haven't welcomed a love for the truth so they'd be saved. 11So God will send them a deluding influence to cause them to believe a lie. 12Then the truth will judge disbelievers who delight in doing wrong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> We're always obliged to thank God for you, family of Christ the Lord loves, because God chose you to be the firstfruits of salvation by believing the truth and by the holiness the Spirit brings. 14He called you to that truth by the good news we delivered, which is for obtaining the honor our Lord Jesus Christ has. 15So, stand firm; hold onto the traditions we taught you by word and letter. 16Now may our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father—who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope in grace—17comfort you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say.</span>
