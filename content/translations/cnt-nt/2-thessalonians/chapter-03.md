## 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Finally, pray for us that the Lord's message can make progress and be honored like it has with you. 2Pray for God to deliver us from harmful, evil people, because not everybody believes. 3But, the Lord is faithful; he'll strengthen you and keep you from the evil one. 4We're confident in the Lord that you're doing and will do what we tell you. 5May the Lord direct you to God's love and the endurance that Christ gives you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now, in the name of [our]ms Lord Jesus Christ, stay away from anyone that lives irresponsibly, rather than by the traditions you received from us. 7You know you need to follow our example. We weren't idle among you 8and didn't eat other people's food without paying for it. We worked day and night so we wouldn't burden any of you. 9It's not that we didn't have the right to receive support, but we set ourselves up as an example for you to imitate. 10Besides, when we were with you, we told you that if somebody won't work, they shouldn't eat. 11We hear that some are living irresponsibly, not doing anything but being busybodies. 12By the Lord Jesus Christ we direct and urge people like that to work quietly and eat their own food. 13Don't get discouraged with doing good. 14If any don't obey what we've said in this letter, don't associate with them so they'll be ashamed. 15Don't consider them enemies; warn them like members of Christ's family.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Now may the Lord that brings peace give you peace in every situation. The Lord be with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The salutation with my own hand—an identifying mark in every letter I write. This is what my handwriting looks like.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span>
