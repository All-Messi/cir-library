## 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3

### Request for Prayer

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Finally, pray for us that the Lord’s message can make progress and be honored like <em>it has</em> with you. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Pray for God to deliver us from harmful, evil people, because not everybody believes. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But, the Lord is faithful; he’ll strengthen you and keep <em>you</em> from the evil one. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>We’re confident in the Lord that you’re doing and will do what we tell you. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>May the Lord direct you to God’s love and the endurance that Christ gives you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Th 3:1-5</p>

### Warnings About Idleness


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now, in the name of [our]<sup>ms</sup> Lord Jesus Christ, stay away from anyone that lives irresponsibly, rather than by the traditions you received from us. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>You know you need to follow our example. We weren’t idle among you <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and didn’t eat other people’s food without paying for it. We worked day and night so we wouldn’t burden any of you. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>It’s not that we didn’t have the right <em>to receive support</em>, but we set ourselves up as an example for you to imitate. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Besides, when we were with you, we told you that if somebody won’t work, they shouldn’t eat. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>We hear that some are living irresponsibly, not doing anything but being busybodies. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>By the Lord Jesus Christ we direct and urge people like that to work quietly and eat their own food. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Don’t get discouraged with doing good. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If any don’t obey what we’ve said in <em>this</em> letter, don’t associate with them so they’ll be ashamed. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Don’t consider <em>them</em> enemies; warn <em>them</em> like members of Christ’s family.</span>

### Farewell


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Now may the Lord that brings peace give you peace in every situation. The Lord <em>be</em> with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The salutation with my own hand—an identifying mark in every letter <em>I write</em>. This is what my handwriting looks like.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with you.</span>
