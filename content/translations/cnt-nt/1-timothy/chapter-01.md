## 1 Timothy Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of ChristMessiah Jesus by the authority of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope, 2to Timothy my loyal son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I left for Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to teach false doctrine 4or pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. Those things lead to speculation rather than God's plan, which operates by faith. 5The goal of instruction is love from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and sincere faith. 6Some have turned away from these to empty talk and got lost. 7They want to teach the Law, but they don't know what they're talking about so confidently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> We know the Law is good if you use it 'lawfully.' 9It's not there so much for good people, as for lawless, disorderly, godless, sinful, unholy, profane people. It's for murderers, for people that kill their fathers and mothers, 10for immoral people, male homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and anything else that contradicts sound doctrine 11as set forth in the glorious good news from our blessed God—the good news he entrusted me with.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'm grateful to Christ Jesus who has strengthened me and considered me worth trusting though I'd been a blasphemer, persecutor, insolent person. 13I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in disbelief. 14The Lord's grace overflowed with the faith and love that's in Christ Jesus. 15There's a reliable statement that deserves full acceptance: "Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners and I'm the worst." 16I received mercy so Christ Jesus could use me to demonstrate his extreme patience. The "worst sinner" provided an example to people that would later trust in Christ for eternal life. 17Now to the eternal King and only God, immortal, invisible be honor and glory forevermore! Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'm entrusting that instruction to you, Timothy my son. I'm doing it because of the prophecies about you early on so that on the basis of them you can fight the good fight 19with faith and a clear conscience. Some have refused to listen to their conscience and have shipwrecked as far as faith is concerned. 20Hymeneas and Alexander are two examples; I've delivered them to Satan to teach them not to blaspheme.</span>
