## 1 Timothy Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> Jesus by the authority of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to Timothy <em>my</em> loyal son in the faith. Grace, mercy, <em>and</em> peace from God <em>the</em> Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 1:1-2</p>

### Warning Against False Teachers


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I left for Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to teach false doctrine <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>or pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. Those things lead to speculation rather than God’s plan, which operates by faith. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The goal of instruction is love from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and sincere faith. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Some have turned away from these to empty talk and got lost. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They want to teach the Law, but they don’t know what they’re talking about so confidently.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 1:3-7</p>

### Using the Law Lawfully


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> We know the Law is good if you use it ‘lawfully.’ <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>It’s not there <em>so much </em>for good people, as for lawless, disorderly, godless, sinful, unholy, profane <em>people</em>. It’s for murderers, for people that kill <em>their </em>fathers and mothers, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>for immoral people, male homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and anything else that contradicts sound doctrine <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>as set forth in the glorious good news from our blessed God—the good news he entrusted me with.</span>

### Paul’s Gratitude for Salvation


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I’m grateful to Christ Jesus who has strengthened me and considered me worth trusting though I’d been a blasphemer, persecutor, insolent person. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in disbelief. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The Lord’s grace overflowed with the faith and love that’s in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>There’s a reliable statement that deserves full acceptance: <em>“</em><em>Christ</em><em> Jesus came to the world to save sinners and I’m the worst.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>I received mercy so Christ Jesus could use me to demonstrate <em>his </em>extreme patience. The “worst sinner” provided an example to people that would later trust in <em>Christ</em> for eternal life. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Now to the eternal King and only God, immortal, invisible <em>be</em> honor and glory forevermore! Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I’m entrusting that instruction to you, Timothy <em>my</em> son. I’m doing it because of the prophecies about you early on so that on the basis of them you can fight the good fight <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>with faith and a clear conscience. Some have refused to listen to <em>their conscience</em> and have shipwrecked as far as faith is concerned. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Hymeneas and Alexander are <em>two examples</em>; I’ve delivered them to Satan to teach them not to blaspheme.</span>
