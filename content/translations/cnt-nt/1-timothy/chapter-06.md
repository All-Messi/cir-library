## 1 Timothy Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Servants should fully respect their masters so God and <em>his</em> doctrine aren’t slandered. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Servants with believing masters must not disregard them because they’re equals; they need to serve them even more because the ones that are benefiting from their good service are faithful and loved.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 6:1-</p>

### 2a Consequences of False Teaching Teachsg and encourage everyone to do these things. 3If anybody teaches something that doesn’t agree with sound words from our Lord Jesus Christ and with godly teaching, 4he’s conceited and lacks understanding. He has an unhealthy desire to debate and arguments about words. Things like that produce jealousy, division, slander, suspicion, 5constant arguing by people depraved in mind and deprived of truth. They think godliness is a way to gain wealth, 6but godliness with contentment is a great gain. 7We didn’t bring anything into the world, and we can’t take anything out. 8Let’s be content with food and clothes. 9People that want to get rich encounter temptation, which traps them in foolish, harmful desires and drags them down to ruin. 10The love for money is the root of all kinds of evil. Some that strain after wealth have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.   	 1 Tim 6:3-10 Keeping Morals and Priorities Straight


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>But, man of God, run away from wealth; pursue goodness, faith, love, perseverance, gentleness. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life God called you to, the good acknowledgement you made in front of many witnesses. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I charge [you]<sup>ms</sup> in front of God, who gives life to everything, and Christ Jesus, who acknowledged who he was in front of Pontius Pilate: <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>be spotless and without blame; keep the commandment until the Lord Jesus Christ comes. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>At the right time he’ll be revealed by the blessed and only Master, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>who alone has immortality, who lives in light so bright you can’t approach, that no one has seen or can see: to him <em>be </em>honor and eternal dominion! Amen.</span>

### Words to the Wealthy


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Instruct people that are wealthy now not to be proud or to have <em>their</em> hope based on the uncertainty of wealth. <em>Tell them to put their hope</em> in God, who supplies us richly with everything we enjoy. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Instruct</em><em> them</em> to be rich in good deeds, <em>to be </em>generous, willing to share, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>treasuring up for themselves a firm foundation for the future, so they can experience what’s truly life indeed.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 6:17-19</p>

### Maintaining the True Knowledge


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Timothy, guard what’s been entrusted to you. Avoid profane, empty talk, and the opposing notions that come from knowledge falsely so-called. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Some have professed that knowledge and strayed away from the truth. Grace <em>be</em> with you.</span>
