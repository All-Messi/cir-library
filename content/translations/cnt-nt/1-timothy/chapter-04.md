## 1 Timothy Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Spirit says that later on people will abandon the faith. They'll pay attention to deceiving spirits and demons' doctrines, and indulge 2in the hypocrisy of liars that have a seared conscience. 3They'll forbid marriage and require abstinence from food that God created for faithful people to receive with gratitude. 4Everything he created is good, and nothing should be rejected if people that know the truth receive it gratefully. 5God's word and our prayers sanctify everything he created.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> If you point this out to the disciples, you'll be serving Christ Jesus well, and you'll be fed by the message about faith and the good teaching you've been following. 7Stay away from profane, silly myths. Exercise yourself for godliness. 8Bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness profits a lot because it promises life now and later. 9The saying is reliable and deserves full acceptance: 10"We labor and struggle because we've placed our hope in the living God, everybody's Savior, specifically believers." 11Teach and command that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Don't let anybody disregard you because you're young. Set an example for the faithful in what you say and do—in love, faith, purity. 13Till I get there, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to encouragement, to teaching. 14Don't neglect your spiritual gift that you received by prophecy and the laying on of hands by the eldership. 15Cultivate it; immerse yourself in it so everybody will see your progress. 16Pay close attention to how you live and to your teaching work. Stay true to the truth so you'll save yourself and your listeners.</span>
