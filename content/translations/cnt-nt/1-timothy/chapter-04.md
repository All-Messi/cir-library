## 1 Timothy Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The Spirit says that later on people will abandon the faith. They’ll pay attention to deceiving spirits and demons’ doctrines, and indulge <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>in the hypocrisy of liars that have a seared conscience. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em> forbid marriage and require abstinence from food that God created for faithful people to receive with gratitude. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Everything he created is good, and nothing should be rejected if people that know the truth receive it gratefully. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>God’s word and <em>our </em>prayers sanctify everything he created.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 4:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>If you point this out to the disciples, you’ll be serving Christ Jesus well, and you’ll be fed by the message about faith and the good teaching you’ve been following. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Stay away from profane, silly myths. Exercise yourself for godliness. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness profits a lot because it promises life now and later. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The saying is reliable and deserves full acceptance: <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“We</em><em> labor and struggle because we’ve placed our hope in the living God, </em><em>everybody’s </em><em>Savior, specifically believers.</em>” <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Teach and command that.</span>

### Timothy’s Interim Ministry


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Don’t let anybody disregard you because you’re young. Set an example for the faithful in what you say and do—in love, faith, purity. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Till I get there, give attention to the <em>public</em> reading <em>of scripture</em>, to encouragement, to teaching. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Don’t neglect your spiritual gift that you received by prophecy and the laying on of hands by the eldership. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Cultivate it; immerse yourself in it so everybody will see your progress. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Pay close attention to how you live and to your teaching work. Stay true to the truth so you’ll save yourself and your listeners.</span>
