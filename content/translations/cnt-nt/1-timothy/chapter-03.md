## 1 Timothy Chapter 3

### Caracteristics of  Elders

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> It’s a reliable statement: <em>“If any</em><em>one aspires to be</em><em>ing</em><em> an overseer, he</em><em>’s aspiring</em><em> to do a good thing.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He needs to be above criticism, faithful to his wife, moderate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> must </em>not<em> be</em> pushy or addicted to wine. <em>He should be </em>gentle, not combative or greedy for money. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>An</em><em> overseer needs to </em>manage his family well; his children <em>need to be</em> obedient and well-behaved. (<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>If someone doesn’t know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> should</em>n’t<em> be </em>a new convert; he can get proud and fall into the devil’s condemnation. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He needs <em>to have </em>a good reputation among people that aren’t Christians so he won’t fall into disgrace and the devil’s trap.</span>

### Characteristics of Deacons


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Deacons, too, need to have good character, not be two-faced, addicted to a lot of wine, or greedy for dishonest gain, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>men</em><em> who</em> maintain the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They should be examined first, then serve as deacons if they’re blameless. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Their</em> wives need to have good character too, not be inclined to malicious gossip, <em>but</em> temperate, faithful in every respect. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Deacons need to be faithful to their wives, managing <em>their </em>children and family well. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Deacons that serve well gain good standing and added boldness in the faith that’s in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I’m writing to you in hopes of coming soon. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But if I’m delayed, <em>this way</em> you’ll know how to conduct yourself in God’s house, the church of the living God, the foundation and pillar of the truth. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Everybody agrees that the mystery of godliness is great: <em>“He was revealed in</em><em> flesh,</em> <em>	vindicated in</em><em> spirit,</em> <em>	seen by angels,</em> <em>	</em><em>presented among</em><em> nations,</em> <em>	</em><em>believed on</em><em> </em><em>in the world, and</em> <em>	taken up in</em><em> glory.”</span>
