## 1 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So I encourage prayers and thanksgiving for everybody—2kings and other people in authority—that we can lead a peaceful, quiet, godly life. 3That's good and acceptable to God our Savior. 4He wants everyone to learn the truth and be saved. 5There's one God and one Mediator between him and us, the man Christ Jesus, 6who gave himself as a ransom for many, as a testimony given at the right time. 7That's why he appointed me to be a herald and apostle, to teach Gentiles about faith and truth. That's the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> So I want believers everywhere to pray, holding up holy hands without anger or argument. 9I want women to dress modestly and decently, not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, expensive clothes. 10They should 'dress' in good deeds, which is appropriate for women that profess godliness. 11They should learn in quietness and deference. 12I don't let a woman teach or exercise authority over a man; she should remain quiet. 13For Adam was formed first, then Eve; 14and Adam wasn't deceived; the woman was deceived and fell into transgression. 15But she'll be saved through her child-rearing role, if her children continue in faith, love, sanctification, and decency.</span>
