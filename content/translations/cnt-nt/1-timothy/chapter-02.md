## 1 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So I encourage prayers and thanksgiving for everybody—<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>kings and <em>other </em>people in authority—that we can lead a peaceful, quiet, godly life. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>That’s good and acceptable to God our Savior. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He wants everyone to learn the truth and be saved. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>There’s</em> one God and one Mediator between him and us, <em>the</em> man Christ Jesus, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>who gave himself as a ransom for many, <em>as a</em> testimony given at the right time. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>That’s why he appointed me to be a herald and apostle, to teach Gentiles about faith and truth. That’s the truth.</span>

### Men’s and Women’s Decorum


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> So I want believers everywhere to pray, holding up holy hands without anger or argument. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> want</em> women to dress modestly and decently, not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, expensive clothes. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> should ‘dress’ </em>in good deeds, which is appropriate for women that profess godliness. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They should learn in quietness and deference. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I don’t let a woman teach or exercise authority over a man; she should remain quiet. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For Adam was formed first, then Eve; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and Adam wasn’t deceived; the woman was deceived and fell into transgression. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But she’ll be saved through <em>her </em>child-rearing <em>role</em>, if <em>her children</em> continue in faith, love, sanctification, and decency.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
