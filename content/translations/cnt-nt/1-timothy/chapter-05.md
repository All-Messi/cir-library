## 1 Timothy Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Don’t reprimand an elder; urge <em>him</em> like a father. Encourage younger men like brothers; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters, in purity.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 5:1-2</p>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Honor widows that don’t have anybody to depend on. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn to practice godliness toward their own family and repay parents; that’s acceptable with God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> A widow that’s by herself has put her hope in God and continues in prayers and thanksgiving day and night. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But one that lives in self-interest is dead while she’s alive. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Tell <em>widows</em> to be above criticism.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> If people don’t take care of their own, especially <em>their </em>family, they’ve denied the faith; they’re worse than disbelievers.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 5:3-8</p>

### Guidelines for Welfare Recipients


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don’t enroll a widow younger than 60, who was faithful to her husband, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>with a reputation for doing good, who have raised children, shown hospitality, washed the saints’ feet, helped people in distress, followed every good deed. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Don’t enroll younger widows. While they’re liable to physical interests, they’ll want to remarry, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>incurring criticism for setting aside their previous pledge <em>to Christ</em>. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>At the same time, they can get in the habit of not doing anything, going around the neighborhood talking about things they shouldn’t. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So I prefer younger <em>widows</em> to remarry, have children, manage the family—so they don’t give critics a chance to find fault. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Some have already wandered off after Satan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> If a believer<sup>fem</sup> has widows, she should take care of them so the church won’t be burdened, and it can help widows that don’t have anybody <em>to take care of them</em>.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 5:9-16</p>

### Commandments About Leaders


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Consider elders that do their work well to be worthy of double honor, especially the ones that teach. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The scripture says, <strong><em>“Don’t </em></strong><strong><em>put</em></strong><strong><em><sup>sg</sup></em></strong><strong><em> a muzzle on an ox </em></strong><strong><em>while i</em></strong><strong><em>t’s threshing”</em></strong> <strong>[Deut </strong><strong>25:4]</strong>, and, <em>“A </em><em>worker’s</em><em> worth his wages</em><em>”</em><em> </em>[<strong>Mt 10:10; Lk 10:7</strong>]. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Don’t accept an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Publicly reprimand people that keep sinning, so the rest will take heed as well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> In front of God, Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, I solemnly charge you to keep these directives without showing favoritism to anyone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Be careful about laying hands on somebody too soon. Don’t take part in other people’s sins so you’ll keep yourself untainted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Don’t <em>just </em>drink water; use a little wine for your frequent bouts with an upset stomach.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Some people’s sins are obvious as they lead them into condemnation. <em>Other people’s sins</em> become obvious <em>later</em>. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>It works the same way with good things. The ones that aren’t <em>obvious</em> will become obvious someday<em>.</span>
