## 1 Timothy Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Don’t reprimand an elder; urge <em>him</em> like a father. Encourage younger men like brothers; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters, in purity.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Tim 5:1-2</p>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Honor widows that don’t have anybody to depend on. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn to practice godliness toward their own family and repay parents; that’s acceptable with God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>A widow that’s by herself has put her hope in God and continues in prayers and thanksgiving day and night. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But one that lives in self-interest is dead while she’s alive. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Tell <em>widows</em> to be above criticism.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>If people don’t take care of their own, especially <em>their </em>family, they’ve denied the faith; they’re worse than disbelievers.<strong> </strong><strong>  </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong></span>

### Guidelines for Welfare Recipients


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Don’t enroll a widow younger</span>
<p class="section-ref">than 60</p>

### , who was faithful to her husband, 10with a reputation for doing good, who have raised children, shown hospitality, washed the saints’ feet, helped people in distress, followed every good deed. 11Don’t enroll younger widows. While they’re liable to physical interests, they’ll want to remarry, 12incurring criticism for setting aside their previous pledge to Christ. 13At the same time, they can get in the habit of not doing anything, going around the neighborhood talking about things they shouldn’t. 14So I prefer younger widows to remarry, have children, manage the family—so they don’t give critics a chance to find fault. 15Some have already wandered off after Satan.


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>If a believer<sup>fem</sup> has widows, she should take care of them so the church won’t be burdened, and it can help widows that don’t have anybody <em>to take care of them</em>.</span>

### Commandments About Leaders


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Consider elders that do their work well to be worthy of double honor, especially the ones that teach. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The scripture says, <strong><em>“Don’t </em></strong><strong><em>put</em></strong><strong><em><sup>sg</sup></em></strong><strong><em> a muzzle on an ox </em></strong><strong><em>while i</em></strong><strong><em>t’s threshing”</em></strong> <strong>[Deut </strong><strong>25:4]</strong>, and, <em>“A </em><em>worker’s</em><em> worth his wages</em><em>”</em><em> </em>[</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 10:10</p>

### ; Lk 10:7]. 1


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Don’t accept an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Publicly reprimand people that keep sinning, so the rest will take heed as well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>In front of God, Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, I solemnly charge you to keep these directives without showing favoritism to anyone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Be careful about laying hands on somebody too soon. Don’t take part in other people’s sins so you’ll keep yourself untainted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Don’t <em>just </em>drink water; use a little wine for your frequent bouts with an upset stomach.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Some people’s sins are obvious as they lead them into condemnation. <em>Other people’s sins</em> become obvious <em>later</em>. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>It works the same way with good things. The ones that aren’t <em>obvious</em> will become obvious someday<em>.   </em><em>	 </em></span>
