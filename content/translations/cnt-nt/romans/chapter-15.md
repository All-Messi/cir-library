## Romans Chapter **15**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>We that are strong need to bear with people’s weaknesses, instead of pleasing ourselves. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Let’s make every effort to be pleasing to our neighbors for <em>their</em> good, so we can build them up. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Christ didn’t please himself; like the scripture says, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>The insults from</em></strong><strong><em> th</em></strong><strong><em>e ones that insulted you </em></strong> <strong><em>have fallen on me</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps. </strong><strong>69:9b</strong><strong>]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>What was written earlier was written to instruct us so that by patience and the scriptures’ encouragement we could have hope. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>May God, who is patient and encouraging, influence you to take the attitude toward one another that Jesus Christ takes <em>toward us</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>That way with united voice you can praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rom 15:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So accept one another like Christ accepted you to God’s honor. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I tell you, the Christ has become a minister for the Circumcision for God’s truth, for confirming <em>his</em> promises to the ancestors, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and for the Gentiles to praise God for <em>his</em> mercy—like the scripture says, <strong><em>“I’ll </em></strong><strong><em>acknowledge</em></strong><strong><em> you among the </em></strong><strong><em>Gentiles;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>I’ll sing praises to you</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 18:49]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Again it says, <strong><em>“Ge</em></strong><strong><em>ntiles, rejoice with his people</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 32:43</strong><strong>]</strong>;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>and, <strong><em>“Praise the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>, every </em></strong><strong><em>nation</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	p</em></strong><strong><em>raise him, all peoples</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 117:1]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Again Isaiah says, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>A root will come</em></strong><strong><em> out of Jesse,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>O</em></strong><strong><em>ne who</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>rises</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>up</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>to </em></strong><strong><em>govern</em></strong><strong><em> the Gentiles.</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	They’ll put their hope in him</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 11:10]</strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Now may the God who gives “hope,” fill you with joy and peace in your faith so you’ll have high “hopes” by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rom 15:7-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>My siblings <em>in Christ</em>, I’m confident that you’re good and knowledgeable, and able to admonish one another. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>On some things I’ve written to you boldly to remind you. Because of the grace God gave me, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>I minister God’s good news to the Gentiles as a priest for Christ Jesus. I do it so they can become an acceptable offering that’s sanctified by the Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>In Christ Jesus I have something to take pride in, as far as God’s things are concerned. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I won’t take it on myself to say anything but what Christ has accomplished through me in the Gentiles’ obedience by word and deed. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> he accomplished through me came</em> by the power of signs and wonders <em>that I did</em> by the power of God’s Spirit. So, from Jerusalem to Illyricum I’ve presented the good news about Christ. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>I’ve aimed to preach where people have not known Christ. I didn’t want to build on somebody else’s foundation, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>but like the scripture says, <strong><em>“People</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>that haven’</em></strong><strong><em>t received </em></strong><strong><em>the </em></strong><strong><em>news about him</em></strong><strong><em>, will </em></strong><strong><em>see</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	those who haven’t heard will understand</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 52:15]</strong>.<strong>  </strong><strong>	 </strong></span>

### :14-21 Paul’s Plans 22-23Over the years I’ve wanted to come to you, but I’ve been prevented from doing it. Now I don’t have anywhere left in these regions. 24When I go to Spain, I hope to see you, and to have you send me forward after I’ve refreshed myself with your company for a while. 25At present I’m headed to Jerusalem to serve the saints. 26Macedonia and Achaia wanted to take up a collection for the poor saints in Jerusalem. 27They’ve wanted to do that because they owe them. If the Gentiles have benefited from their spiritual things, they do well to minister to them from physical things. 28When I’ve finished that project and safely delivered the collection, I’ll go through you to Spain. 29When I come, I know I’ll have Christ’s full blessing.  	Rom 15:22-29


<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Now I urge you by our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of the Spirit, to pray sincerely with me that God will deliver me from the ones who disobey in Judaea, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>that the saints will accept my ministry in Jerusalem, <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>and that with joy I’ll come <em>to you</em> by God’s will and refresh myself with you for a while. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Now the God that brings peace <em>be</em> with you all. Amen.</span>
