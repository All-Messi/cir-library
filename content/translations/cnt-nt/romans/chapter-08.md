## Romans Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So there's no condemnation in Christ Jesus. 2The life-producing spirit that operates in him has freed you from law that produces sin and death. 3What the Law couldn't do because it operated through weak flesh, God did by sending his Son in the form of sin-oriented flesh to deal with sin in the flesh and put it in its place. 4So the goodness the Law called for, you can fulfill by living according to the spirit instead of the flesh. 5People that live in a flesh-oriented way focus on material things; people that live in a spirit-oriented way focus on things that are not material. 6The fleshly mentality leads to a dead end; the spiritual mentality leads to life and peace. 7So the flesh-oriented mentality opposes God because it doesn't—and can't—be in submission to his Law. 8People that live in a flesh-oriented way can't be pleasing God. 9But, we're not flesh-oriented, but spirit-oriented if God's Spirit lives in us. If we don't have Christ's spirit, we don't belong to him. 10If Christ is in us, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of goodness. 11If the Spirit of the one that resurrected Jesus is living in us, the One that resurrected Christ will make our mortal bodies alive by the Spirit that is living in us. Living Above the Flesh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So, we're not obliged to live in a flesh-oriented way. 13We'll die if we live that way. But, we'll live if by spirit we put to death the misdeeds of flesh. 14As many as God's spirit leads, are God's children. 15We didn't receive again a sense of bondage resulting in fear, but a sense of sonship that calls out 'Father!' 16The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we're God's children. 17If we're children, then we're heirs, God's heirs, fellow heirs with Christ—if we suffer with him so we can be glorified with him. Longing for the Eternal</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I don't consider the sufferings of this time worth comparing to the glory that'll be revealed. 19Creation's deep longing waits for that revelation to God's children. 20Creation's been subjected to worthlessness, not willingly, but by the One who subjected it in hopes 21of freeing it from bondage to decay and delivering it to the glorious freedom of God's children. 22Up till now the whole creation has been groaning in birth pains. 23We, too, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, long to be adopted as children, and to have our bodies redeemed. 24Hope has saved us but hope that we can see isn't hope. 25We hope for what we don't see, and patiently long for it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And, the Spirit helps our weaknesses. We don't know what to pray for, but he intercedes for us with sighs we can't say. 27The One who examines hearts understands what our spirits mean and intercedes for the saints in a way that harmonizes with God's will. 28We know everything works out for good for those who love God and are called in a way that fits with his purpose. 29The ones he foreknew he predestined to conform to the image of his Son so he'd be the oldest of many brothers. 30The ones he predestined he called, justified, and glorified. Trials Don't Show Separation from God</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> What's that tell us? If God's for us, who's against us? 32If he didn't spare his own Son, but offered him up for us all, how will he not graciously give us everything we need? 33Who's going to level accusation against God's chosen people? He justifies; who condemns? 34Jesus Christ is the One that died and, beyond that, resurrected to God's right hand to intercede for us. 35What's going to separate us from the love Christ has for us? Trouble, distress, persecution famine, nakedness, danger, or sword? 36As the scripture says, "We're killed all day long for your sake; we're considered sheep for slaughter" [Ps 44:22].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> In all these things, we more than conquer through the One who loved us. 38I'm confident that death or life, angels or rulers, present or future things, powers, 39height or depth, or any other created thing, can't separate us from the love God has for us in Christ Jesus our Lord. God's Choice of Israel</span>
