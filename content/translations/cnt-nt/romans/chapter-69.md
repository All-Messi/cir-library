## Romans Chapter 69

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> What was written earlier was written to instruct us so that by patience and the scriptures' encouragement we could have hope. 5May God, who is patient and encouraging, influence you to take the attitude toward one another that Jesus Christ takes toward us. 6That way with united voice you can praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So accept one another like Christ accepted you to God's honor. 8I tell you, the Christ has become a minister for the Circumcision for God's truth, for confirming his promises to the ancestors, 9and for the Gentiles to praise God for his mercy—like the scripture says, "I'll acknowledge you among the Gentiles; I'll sing praises to you" [Ps 18:49].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> b].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Again it says, "Gentiles, rejoice with his people" [Deut 32:43];</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> and, "Praise the LORD, every nation; praise him, all peoples" [Ps 117:1].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Again Isaiah says, "A root will come out of Jesse, One who rises up to govern the Gentiles. They'll put their hope in him" [Is 11:10].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Now may the God who gives "hope," fill you with joy and peace in your faith so you'll have high "hopes" by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> My siblings in Christ, I'm confident that you're good and knowledgeable, and able to admonish one another. 15On some things I've written to you boldly to remind you. Because of the grace God gave me, 16I minister God's good news to the Gentiles as a priest for Christ Jesus. I do it so they can become an acceptable offering that's sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 17In Christ Jesus I have something to take pride in, as far as God's things are concerned. 18I won't take it on myself to say anything but what Christ has accomplished through me in the Gentiles' obedience by word and deed. 19What he accomplished through me came by the power of signs and wonders that I did by the power of God's Spirit. So, from Jerusalem to Illyricum I've presented the good news about Christ. 20I've aimed to preach where people have not known Christ. I didn't want to build on somebody else's foundation, 21but like the scripture says, "People that haven't received the news about him, will see; those who haven't heard will understand" [Is 52:15]. Paul's Plans 22-23Over the years I've wanted to come to you, but I've been prevented from doing it. Now I don't have anywhere left in these regions. 24When I go to Spain, I hope to see you, and to have you send me forward after I've refreshed myself with your company for a while. 25At present I'm headed to Jerusalem to serve the saints. 26Macedonia and Achaia wanted to take up a collection for the poor saints in Jerusalem. 27They've wanted to do that because they owe them. If the Gentiles have benefited from their spiritual things, they do well to minister to them from physical things. 28When I've finished that project and safely delivered the collection, I'll go through you to Spain. 29When I come, I know I'll have Christ's full blessing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Now I urge you by our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of the Spirit, to pray sincerely with me that God will deliver me from the ones who disobey in Judaea, 31that the saints will accept my ministry in Jerusalem, 32and that with joy I'll come to you by God's will and refresh myself with you for a while. 33Now the God that brings peace be with you all. Amen. Extensive Greetings</span>
