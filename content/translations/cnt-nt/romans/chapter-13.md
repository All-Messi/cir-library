## Romans Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Every person needs to submit to higher authorities, because there’s no authority except by God’s <em>approval</em>. God has established the authorities that exist. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So if a person resists them, he’s resisting what God has established, and he’ll be condemned for it. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Rulers don’t bring fear for good behavior, but for bad. You shouldn’t be afraid of authority. Do what’s right, and you’ll be praised for it. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’re God’s ministers to you for good. If you do what’s wrong, be afraid; they don’t carry a sword for nothing. They punish people for doing bad things. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So you need to submit, not only to avoid punishment, but for conscience sake. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For the same reason, pay <em>your</em> taxes, because they’re God’s ministers, who dedicate themselves to those very things. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Pay everybody what’s due to them—taxes, customs, respect, honor.</span>

### Call for Renewed Goodness


<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Don’t owe people anything except to love them. The one that loves another fulfills the Law. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong><em>“Do</em></strong><strong><em> not commit adultery, </em></strong><strong><em>murder, steal</em></strong><strong><em>, covet</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex 20:13-15, 17; Deut</strong><strong> 5:17-19, 21]</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>or any other commandment is summed up in <strong><em>“Love your neighbor as yourself</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Lev</strong><strong> 19:18]</strong>.<em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Love doesn’t do anything bad to a “neighbor;” so it fulfills the Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>Do</em> that because you know it’s time to get up from sleeping. Your salvation’s nearer now than when you came to believe. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Nighttime is far gone and daytime’s coming; so lay aside what people do in the dark and pick up the tools used in daylight. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Live respectably in the daylight, not with carousing and indecency, rivalry and jealousy. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don’t cater to physical drives.</span>
