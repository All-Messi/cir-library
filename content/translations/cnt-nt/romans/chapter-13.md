## Romans Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Every person needs to submit to higher authorities, because there's no authority except by God's approval. God has established the authorities that exist. 2So if a person resists them, he's resisting what God has established, and he'll be condemned for it. 3Rulers don't bring fear for good behavior, but for bad. You shouldn't be afraid of authority. Do what's right, and you'll be praised for it. 4They're God's ministers to you for good. If you do what's wrong, be afraid; they don't carry a sword for nothing. They punish people for doing bad things. 5So you need to submit, not only to avoid punishment, but for conscience sake. 6For the same reason, pay your taxes, because they're God's ministers, who dedicate themselves to those very things. 7Pay everybody what's due to them—taxes, customs, respect, honor. Call for Renewed Goodness</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don't owe people anything except to love them. The one that loves another fulfills the Law. 9"Do not commit adultery, murder, steal, covet" [Ex 20:13-15, 17; Deut 5:17-19, 21] or any other commandment is summed up in "Love your neighbor as yourself" [Lev 19:18]. 10Love doesn't do anything bad to a "neighbor;" so it fulfills the Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Do that because you know it's time to get up from sleeping. Your salvation's nearer now than when you came to believe. 12Nighttime is far gone and daytime's coming; so lay aside what people do in the dark and pick up the tools used in daylight. 13Live respectably in the daylight, not with carousing and indecency, rivalry and jealousy. 14Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don't cater to physical drives. Cautiously Accepting Weak Brothers</span>
