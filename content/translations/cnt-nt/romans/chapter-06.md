## Romans Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So should we say, <em>“Let’s keep sinning so </em><em>there’ll be more grace</em><em>”</em>? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Goodness, no! How can we who died to sin keep living in it? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Don’t you know that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus, were baptized into his death? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Baptism buried us with him into death. As the Father gloriously raised Christ from the dead, we too can live in a new life. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>If we’ve participated in what’s like his death, we’ll participate in what’s like his resurrection. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Know this: our old self was crucified with him to destroy the sinful body so we wouldn’t serve sin anymore. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Whoever dies is justified from sin. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If we’ve died with Christ, we believe we’ll live with him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We know that since Christ arose from the dead, he won’t die again, and death doesn’t have control over him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The death he died, he died to sin once and for all; the life he lives now, he keeps living to God. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>We consider ourselves dead to sin too, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</span>

### “Enslaved” to Righteousness


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So don’t let sin prevail in your mortal body by yielding its drives. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Don’t keep offering your members as tools for unrighteousness. Offer yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and offer your members to him as tools for righteousness. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Sin won’t be controlling you because you’re under grace, not law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> What then? Should we sin because we’re under grace instead of law? Goodness, no! <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Don’t you know that whatever you yield to, you’re ‘slaves’ to—<em>‘</em><em>servants’</em> to sin, <em>which leads</em> to death or ‘servants’ to obedience, <em>which leads</em> to righteousness? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Thank God, though you used to be servants to sin, you’ve obeyed from the heart the type of teaching you received. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>You’ve been freed from sin and put ‘in servitude’ to righteousness (<strong><sup>19</sup></strong>an illustration to help you understand). As you ‘put yourselves in servitude’ to unrighteousness and increasing lawlessness, now ‘put yourselves in servitude’ to righteousness and holiness. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When you were servants to sin, you were ‘free’ from righteousness. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>So, what things were you producing then that you’re ashamed of now? Their outcome <em>was</em> <u>death</u>. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Now that you’re free from sin and ‘in servitude’ to God, you’re producing holiness, whose outcome <em>is</em> eternal <u>life</u>. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The wages of sin <em>is</em> death, but the gracious gift of God <em>is</em> life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
