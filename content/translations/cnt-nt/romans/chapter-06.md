## Romans Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So should we say, "Let's keep sinning so there'll be more grace"? 2Goodness, no! How can we who died to sin keep living in it? 3Don't you know that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus, were baptized into his death? 4Baptism buried us with him into death. As the Father gloriously raised Christ from the dead, we too can live in a new life. 5If we've participated in what's like his death, we'll participate in what's like his resurrection. 6Know this: our old self was crucified with him to destroy the sinful body so we wouldn't serve sin anymore. 7Whoever dies is justified from sin. 8If we've died with Christ, we believe we'll live with him. 9We know that since Christ arose from the dead, he won't die again, and death doesn't have control over him. 10The death he died, he died to sin once and for all; the life he lives now, he keeps living to God. 11We consider ourselves dead to sin too, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So don't let sin prevail in your mortal body by yielding its drives. 13Don't keep offering your members as tools for unrighteousness. Offer yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and offer your members to him as tools for righteousness. 14Sin won't be controlling you because you're under grace, not law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> What then? Should we sin because we're under grace instead of law? Goodness, no! 16Don't you know that whatever you yield to, you're 'slaves' to—'servants' to sin, which leads to death or 'servants' to obedience, which leads to righteousness? 17Thank God, though you used to be servants to sin, you've obeyed from the heart the type of teaching you received. 18You've been freed from sin and put 'in servitude' to righteousness (19an illustration to help you understand). As you 'put yourselves in servitude' to unrighteousness and increasing lawlessness, now 'put yourselves in servitude' to righteousness and holiness. 20When you were servants to sin, you were 'free' from righteousness. 21So, what things were you producing then that you're ashamed of now? Their outcome was death. 22Now that you're free from sin and 'in servitude' to God, you're producing holiness, whose outcome is eternal life. 23The wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
