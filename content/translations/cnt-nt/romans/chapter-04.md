## Romans Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>What can we say, then, our ancestor Abraham discovered? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>If what he did, justified him, he had something to feel good about, but not toward God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>What does the scripture say? <strong><em>“Abraham </em></strong><strong><em><u>trusted</u></em></strong><strong><em> God, and God </em></strong><strong><em><u>considered</u></em></strong><strong><em> him righteous</em></strong><strong><em>” </em></strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 15:6]</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>because of it.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>In the case of people that are <u>producing</u> <em>righteousness</em>, the consequence—<em>being considered righteous</em>—doesn’t come from God or his <u>grace</u>; he would <u>owe</u> it to them <em>to consider them righteous</em>. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But for those who are <u>not producing </u><em><u>righteousness</u></em> but are <u>trusting the One that</u> <u>considers the ungodly as righteous</u>, their trusting God <em>to do that</em> is considered righteousness. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>David speaks about the “good fortune” of people <em>God</em> considers righteous aside from law, <sup>	</sup><sup>	</sup><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><em>“‘Fortunate</em></strong><strong><em>’ are the ones</em></strong><strong><em> whose unlawful deeds God forgives,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	whose sins he covers.</em></strong> <strong><em><sup>	</sup></em></strong><strong><em><sup>	</sup></em></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Fortunate’</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>are the people whose sin the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	d</em></strong><strong><em>oesn’t hold against them</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 32:1-2]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Is the “good fortune” <em>only</em> on the circumcised, or <em>is it </em>on the uncircumcised too? We’ve said, <strong><em>“God considered Abrah</em></strong><strong><em>am righteous because he trusted</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 15:6]</strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When did God consider him righteous? When he was circumcised or uncircumcised? When he was <u>un</u>circumcised. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He received the circumcision sign as a seal for the righteousness he’d received by trusting when he was <u>un</u>circumcised. <em>And he received it as a seal </em>that he would be the father of everybody that, without being circumcised, trust that God will consider them righteous <em>like he did Abraham</em>. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>His</em><em> circumcision was</em> also <em>a seal</em> that he would be the father of the uncircumcised who walk in his footsteps while <u>he</u> was uncircumcised.</span>

### The Promise to Abraham


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The promise to Abraham and his descendants—that he’d inherit the world—didn’t come by law, but by righteousness conditioned on trusting. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If law can cause people to be heirs, trust is null and promise is void. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Law brings <em>God’s </em>displeasure, but where there’s no law there’s no violation of it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So righteousness comes by <u>trust</u> so it can come by <u>grace</u> and make the <u>promise</u> sure for all of <em>Abraham’s </em>seed, whether they’re under law or under the trust he had who is “father” of us all: <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>the scripture says, <strong><em>“I’ve appointed you to be the father of many nations”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 17:5]</strong>.<strong> </strong>He trusted God, who makes the dead live and speaks of things that aren’t <em>yet</em> as if they <em>already </em>are. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Hoping against hope, he trusted that he would become <em>“the father of many nations</em>,<em>”</em> like God said, <strong><em>“That’s how your seed will be</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 15:5]</strong><em>.</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He wasn’t weak in trust but considered his own body as good as dead—he was</span>

He praised God, 21confident that what he’d promised, he could do. 22So, “God considered him righteous” [Gen 15:6]. 23Now that wasn’t written just about him, 24but about us too. God will consider us “righteous” who trust in the One that resurrected our Lord Jesus—25who was delivered up for our trespasses and resurrected for our justification. 	 Rom 4:13-25 Extreme Grace
