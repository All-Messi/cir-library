## Romans Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant in the church in Cenchrea. 2Welcome her in the Lord in a way appropriate to saints. Help her with whatever she needs. She's helped lots of people, including me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus. 4They've risked their necks to save my life. Not only am I grateful to them; so are all the Gentile churches. 5Greet the church that meets in their house. Hello to Epaenetus, my dear friend, the first convert to Christ in Asia; 6and to Mary, who has worked hard for youpl. 7Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kin and fellow prisoners. They're well-known among the apostles and have been Christians longer than I have. 8Give our regards to Ampliatus, my friend in the Lord; 9to Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ; and to my close friend Stachys. 10Greet Apellesmas, approved in Christ, those in the family of Aristobulus, 11and Herodion, my compatriot. Greet the family of Narcissus, who are in the Lord; 12as well as Tryphaena and Tryphosa, laborers in the Lord. Greet 13Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 14Say hello to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the disciples that are with him; 15as well as Philologus and Julia; Nereus and his sister Olympas; and the saints that are with them. 16Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send their greetings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I urge you to keep an eye on people that cause division and upset people's faith by teaching things contrary to what you've learned; stay away from them. 18People like that aren't serving Christ our Lord; they're serving their own appetites. With smooth talk and flattery, they deceive unsuspecting people. 19Everybody's heard about your obedience; so I'm happy over you and want you to be wise about what's good and innocent about what's bad. 20The God that brings peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Timothy, my fellow worker, says hello, as does Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen. (22I, Tertius, the one writing out this letter, greets you in the Lord.) 23Gaius, host to me and the whole church, sends regards. Erastus, the city treasurer, greets you as does Quartus the brother. [24]ms 25Now to the One who can give you security by the good news I'm delivering about Jesus Christ, according to the mystery</span>
