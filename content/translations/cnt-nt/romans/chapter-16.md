## Romans Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant in the church in Cenchrea. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Welcome her in the Lord in a way appropriate to saints. Help her with whatever she needs. She’s helped lots of people, including me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’ve risked their necks to save my life. Not only am <u>I</u> grateful to them; so are all the Gentile churches. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Greet the church that meets in their house. Hello to Epaenetus, my dear friend, the first convert to Christ in Asia; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and to Mary, who has worked hard for you<sup>pl</sup>. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kin and fellow prisoners. They’re well-known among the apostles and have been Christians longer than I have. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Give our regards to Ampliatus, my friend in the Lord; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>to Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ; and to my close friend Stachys. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Greet Apelles<sup>m</sup><sup>a</sup><sup>s</sup>, approved in Christ, those <em>in the </em><em>family</em> of Aristobulus, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and Herodion, my compatriot. Greet the <em>family</em> of Narcissus, who are in the Lord; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>as well as Tryphaena and Tryphosa, laborers in the Lord. Greet <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Say hello to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the disciples that are with him; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>as well as Philologus and Julia; Nereus and his sister Olympas; and the saints that are with them. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send their greetings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>I urge you to keep an eye on people that cause division and upset people’s faith by teaching things contrary to what you’ve learned; stay away from them. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>People like that aren’t serving Christ our Lord; <em>they’re serving</em> their own appetites. With smooth talk and flattery, they deceive unsuspecting people. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Everybody’s heard about your obedience; so I’m happy over you and want you to be wise about what’s good and innocent about what’s bad. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The God that brings peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Timothy, my fellow worker, says hello, as does Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen. (<strong><sup>22</sup></strong>I, Tertius, the one writing out this letter, greets you in the Lord.) <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Gaius, host to me and the whole church, sends regards. Erastus, the city treasurer, greets you <em>as does</em> Quartus the brother.</span>

### Closing Doxology [24]ms 25Now to the One who can give you security by the good news I’m delivering about Jesus Christ, according to the mystery kept unrevealed from times eternal,


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>but revealed now in the scriptures of the prophets by the commandment of the eternal God, made known to all nations, and leading to an obedience <em>rooted in</em> faith—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>to the only wise God through Jesus Christ <em>be</em> glory forever! Amen.</span>
