## Romans Chapter 14

### Cautiously Accepting Weak Brothers

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Accept people that are weak in faith, and don’t pass judgment on the way they think. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>One person believes he can eat anything, but a weak person <em>just </em>eats vegetables. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The one that eats must not look down on the one that doesn’t; the one that doesn’t eat must not criticize the one that does. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>What right do you have to criticize somebody else’s household servant? He stands or falls to his own Lord. And, he will stand because the Lord can make him stand. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>One person considers one day more important than another; another person considers every day alike. Each one should be fully confident in his own mind. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The one that observes a day observes <em>it</em> to the Lord; the one that eats, eats to the Lord because he thanks God. The one that doesn’t eat, doesn’t eat to the Lord, and thanks God. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>None of us live to ourselves or die to ourselves. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If we live, we live to the Lord; if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we’re the Lord’s.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>That’s why Christ died and came to life so he could serve as Lord of the living and the dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And why criticize<sup>sg</sup> your fellow Christians or look down on them? We’ll all stand at God’s judgment seat. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The scripture says, 	<strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>As sure as I live,</em></strong><strong><em>’ the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> says,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>every knee will bend to </em></strong><strong><em>me</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>every tongue will </em></strong><strong><em>acknowledge</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>me’</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is 49:18 +</strong><strong> 45:23]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So each one of us will give account of himself to God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rom 14:1-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Don’t criticize one another anymore. Determine<sup>pl</sup> not to make your brother or sister stumble. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I’m convinced that no <u>thing</u> <em>is</em> unclean in itself, but it <u>is</u> unclean to someone that considers it unclean. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If you’re grieving your fellow Christian by what you’re eating, don’t destroy with food the one Christ died for. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Don’t let people slander your goodness. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>God’s kingdom doesn’t have to do with what you eat or drink; it has to do with goodness, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>A person that serves Christ that way is acceptable to God and respectable to people. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>So let’s follow what makes for peace and what helps one another. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Don’t tear down God’s work by what you eat. Everything’s pure, but it’s not pure for people that feel like they’re offending <em>God </em>when they eat it. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>It’s good not to eat meat or drink wine or <em>do</em> anything that makes someone stumble. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Exercise your faith in front of God according to your own convictions <em>on such matters</em>. People are fortunate that don’t condemn themselves by what they approve of. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>If they have doubts about what they’re eating, they stand condemned because they’re not doing it out of a good conscience. Anything that doesn’t arise from a good conscience is sin.<strong></span>
