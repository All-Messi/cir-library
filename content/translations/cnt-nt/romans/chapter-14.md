## Romans Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Accept people that are weak in faith, and don't pass judgment on the way they think. 2One person believes he can eat anything, but a weak person just eats vegetables. 3The one that eats must not look down on the one that doesn't; the one that doesn't eat must not criticize the one that does. 4What right do you have to criticize somebody else's household servant? He stands or falls to his own Lord. And, he will stand because the Lord can make him stand. 5One person considers one day more important than another; another person considers every day alike. Each one should be fully confident in his own mind. 6The one that observes a day observes it to the Lord; the one that eats, eats to the Lord because he thanks God. The one that doesn't eat, doesn't eat to the Lord, and thanks God. 7None of us live to ourselves or die to ourselves. 8If we live, we live to the Lord; if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we're the Lord's.  9That's why Christ died and came to life so he could serve as Lord of the living and the dead. 10And why criticizesg your fellow Christians or look down on them? We'll all stand at God's judgment seat. 11The scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So each one of us will give account of himself to God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Don't criticize one another anymore. Determinepl not to make your brother or sister stumble. 14I'm convinced that no thing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean to someone that considers it unclean. 15If you're grieving your fellow Christian by what you're eating, don't destroy with food the one Christ died for. 16Don't let people slander your goodness. 17God's kingdom doesn't have to do with what you eat or drink; it has to do with goodness, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit. 18A person that serves Christ that way is acceptable to God and respectable to people. 19So let's follow what makes for peace and what helps one another. 20Don't tear down God's work by what you eat. Everything's pure, but it's not pure for people that feel like they're offending God when they eat it. 21It's good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes someone stumble. 22Exercise your faith in front of God according to your own convictions on such matters. People are fortunate that don't condemn themselves by what they approve of. 23If they have doubts about what they're eating, they stand condemned because they're not doing it out of a good conscience. Anything that doesn't arise from a good conscience is sin.</span>
