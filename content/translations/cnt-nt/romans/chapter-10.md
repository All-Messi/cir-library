## Romans Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My heart's desire and prayer to God is for their salvation. 2I admit they have a zeal for God, but they don't know what they're doing. 3They don't understand the righteousness that comes from God, and they try to establish their righteousness by themselves. They haven't submitted to the righteousness God gives. 4For everybody that trusts, Christ puts an end to law as a way to achieve righteousness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> As to righteousness under law, Moses writes, "The one that does them is the one that will have life by them" [Lev 18:5]. 6But goodness that comes from trust says, "Don't say in your heart, 'Who'll go up into the sky? [Deut 30:12]" (that is, to bring Christ down); 7or, 'Who'll go down into the ground'? (that is, to raise Christ up from the dead)." 8But what does it say? "The message is near you— in your mouth and in your heart" [Deut 30:14]. That's the "message" about trust, the message we preach. 9If you acknowledge Jesus as Lord and trust in your heart that God raised him from the dead, he'll "save" you. 10With your heart you trust to be considered upright; with your mouth you confess to receive salvation. 11The scripture says, "He won't disappoint those who trust in him" [Is 28:16]. 12There's no difference between Jew and Greek because the same Lord is Lord of both; he's rich toward everybody that calls on him. 13"The LORD will save everybody that calls on him" [Joel 2:32]. Making Salvation by Trust Available</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> How will people call on somebody they don't believe in? How will they believe in somebody they haven't heard about? How will they hear about him without a messenger? 15How will they bring the message if they're not sent? Like the scripture says, "How welcome they are that bring good news!" [Is 52:7; Nah 1:15] 16But not everybody has obeyed the good news. Isaiah says, "LORD, who's believed our report?" [Is 53:1]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So faith comes from hearing—hearing the message about Christ. 18But I say, the Israelites have heard, haven't they? "Their testimony went out all over the world, and their words to the ends of the earth" [Ps 19:4].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But I say, Israel surely didn't know, did they? First, Moses says, "I'll make you jealous by what's not a nation; I'll anger you by a nation that doesn't understand" [Deut 32:21].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Isaiah is bold, "People found me that weren't looking for me; they saw me who weren't asking about me" [Is 65:1].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He tells Israel, "All day long I've held out my hands to a disobedient, stubborn people" [Is.</span>
