## Romans Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, what advantage does a Jew have? What's the benefit of circumcision? 2A lot, in a lot of ways. The first advantage is that God entrusted the Jews with his messages. 3So what if some Jews were unfaithful? Their unfaithfulness doesn't do away with God's faithfulness, does it? 4Goodness, no! Let God be true and everyone else a liar, like the scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> If our unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness, we wouldn't say, would we, that God's not fair in inflicting his displeasure? (I'm speaking here for the sake of argument.) 6Goodness, no! How would he judge the world? 7We wouldn't say, would we, that since our lie highlights God's truth, he shouldn't consider us sinners? 8We wouldn't say, would we—as some accuse us of saying, "Let's do evil to bring about good"? (They deserve condemnation!)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So are we any better than Gentiles? Not at all! We've already said that Jews and Gentiles are both sinners 10like the scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Nobody understands;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They've all turned away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Their throat's an open grave;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> There's no respect for God in their eyes [Ps 36:1].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> We know that what the Law is saying here, it's saying to people that are under it; so by saying "not a one," it shuts everybody up, including Jews. The whole world—Gentiles and Jews—becomes exposed to God's condemnation, 20because what people do under law doesn't make them good; law only tells them what's sinful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Now, aside from law, a goodness from God has come to light, a goodness the Law and prophets talk about: 22a goodness from God through trusting in Jesus Christ whether by Jew or Gentile. 23Everybody has sinned and falls short of God's glory; 24his grace freely justifies them through the redemption that comes through Christ Jesus. 25He's the One that God appointed as a basis for forgiveness by trusting in his blood. Putting him forward demonstrates God's goodness in overlooking sins previously committed 26during the time when he puts up with them. Putting Christ forward demonstrates God's goodness now, so he's both just and justifier of people that trust in Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So where can boasting come in? It can't. By what kind of "law"? Can it come by a "law" caused by what we do under law? No, it's replaced by a "law" conditioned on trust in another—God. 28We reason that trust justifies us apart from what we do under law. 29Or is God the God over Jews only? Isn't he God over Gentiles too? Yes. 30Since there's one God, he's the One that justifies the Circumcision and the Uncircumcision and does it the same way—by trust. 31So are we contradicting law by advocating trust? Goodness, no! We're establishing the purpose of law another way.</span>
