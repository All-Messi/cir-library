## Romans Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So God hasn't set his people aside, has he? Goodness, no! I'm an Israelite too, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin. 2God hasn't set aside the people he chose ahead of time. Don't you know what the scripture says in the passage about Elijah? He pleads with God against Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How does God answer him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It's the same way now. By God's grace there's a remnant. 6If it's by God's grace, it's not from what the remnant does. Otherwise, grace wouldn't be grace. 7So what's the point? What Israel's looking for, it hasn't found, but the Chosen have found it. The rest became stubborn. 8Like the scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> David says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> May their eyes grow dim so they can't see;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So, they didn't stumble and fall down, did they? Goodness, no! By their sin, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make the Jews jealous. 12If their sin enriches the world and their failure enriches the Gentiles, how much more their full number!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'm talking to you Gentiles now. Since I'm an apostle to Gentiles, I highlight my ministry 14if somehow I can make my fellow Jews jealous and save some of them. 15If the Jews' rejecting means reconciling the world, what will their accepting be except a return from the dead? 16If the original piece of dough is holy, the whole lump's holy. If the root's holy, so are the branches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> If some branches were removed and you, a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and partook of the nourishment from the root of the olive tree, 18don't feel superior to the original branches: you don't support the root; it supports you. 19You may say, "Branches were removed so I could be grafted in." 20Right. But they were removed because they didn't trust, and you stand by trust as well. Don't get smug; be reverent. 21If God didn't spare the natural branches because they didn't trust, he won't spare you either. 22So pay attention to God's kindness and severity. For the ones that fell, severity; but for you, God's kindness—if you stay in his kindness. Otherwise, you'll be removed too. 23And if they don't keep distrusting, God will graft them back in; he can do that. 24If God took you out of a naturally wild olive tree and grafted you unnaturally into a cultivated olive tree, much more will he graft them into their own olive tree.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I want you to understand this mystery so you won't feel smug: a hardening has come over Israel in part till the full number of Gentiles comes in. 26That's the way all Israel will be saved, like the scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> That's my covenant with them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> As far as the good news is concerned, they're enemies for your sake; as far as God's choice is concerned, they're highly regarded for their ancestors' sake. 29God's gifts and calling to them aren't being revoked here. 30You once disobeyed God but have now received mercy because they disobeyed. 31In turn, they've now disobeyed because God showed mercy to you to prod them to receive mercy. 32God has locked everyone up in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The depth of God's wealth, wisdom, and knowledge! His judgments are so unknowable, his ways so unfathomable! Who was his counselor? [Is 40:13 LXX; Job 15:8; Jer 23:18]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Who gave to him first</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Everything is from him, by him, and for him. Glory to him forever! Amen.</span>
