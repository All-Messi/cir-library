## Romans Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>We’ve been justified by trusting, and we express trusting God by trusting our Lord Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Christ</em> gives us access to this grace that we stand in. <em>Because of it</em>, we rejoice in the hope that comes from <em>our</em> glorious God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Not only that, but we can even rejoice in hardships because we know they produce <u>endurance</u>, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>which produces <u>character</u>, which produces a <u>hope</u> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>that doesn’t disappoint because God keeps pouring out his love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit he gave us. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When we were still weak, at the right time Christ<sup>M</sup><sup>essiah</sup><sup> </sup>died for the ungodly. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Hardly anybody is <em>willing</em> to die even for <u>somebody that’s</u> <u>good</u>. Somebody might, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>but God has shown us how much he cares about us by having Christ<sup>Messiah</sup><sup> </sup>die for us while we were still <u>sinners</u>. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>More than that, if his blood has justified us, we’re safe from God’s displeasure. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>If the <u>death</u> of his Son reconciled us to God while we were estranged, now that he’s reconciled us, his <u>life</u> will save us. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>All the while, we take pride in God through his Son who reconciled us.</span>

### Adam and Christ in Contrast


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>So, as through one man, sin—hence death—entered the world, death passed on to everybody because everybody has sinned. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Before the Law, there was sin in the world, but sin isn’t held against a person if there’s no law. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But, death did prevail from Adam to Moses even over the ones that hadn’t sinned like Adam did—who corresponds to the One that was to come.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Rom 5:12-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>But the gracious gift isn’t like the sin. In the one case, many died because one sinned. In the other case, many received abundant grace because of God’s gracious gift and the one man Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The gracious gift isn’t like what came through the one sinner; the judgment <em>that came</em> in connection with one sin <em>led</em> to condemnation, but the gracious gift <em>that came </em>in connection with many sins <em>led</em> to justification. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>If <u>death</u> prevailed because of one man’s sin, much more will <u>life</u> prevail—in the ones that receive abundant grace and bestowed righteousness—because of the One, Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>As by the sin of <u>one</u> <em>there was what led</em> to condemnation for <u>all</u> people, so by one act of righteousness <em>there is</em> justification that leads to life for <u>all</u> people. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>As by one man’s disobedience many became sinners, so by One <em>man’s</em> obedience many will become righteous. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The Law came in besides to increase sin, but where sin <u>increased</u> grace <u>multiplied</u>. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>So as sin prevailed in <u>death</u>, grace could prevail in righteousness to eternal <u>life</u> through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
