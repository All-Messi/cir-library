## Romans Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> We've been justified by trusting, and we express trusting God by trusting our Lord Jesus Christ. 2The Christ gives us access to this grace that we stand in. Because of it, we rejoice in the hope that comes from our glorious God. 3Not only that, but we can even rejoice in hardships because we know they produce endurance, 4which produces character, which produces a hope 5that doesn't disappoint because God keeps pouring out his love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit he gave us. 6When we were still weak, at the right time ChristMessiah died for the ungodly. 7Hardly anybody is willing to die even for somebody that's good. Somebody might, 8but God has shown us how much he cares about us by having ChristMessiah die for us while we were still sinners. 9More than that, if his blood has justified us, we're safe from God's displeasure. 10If the death of his Son reconciled us to God while we were estranged, now that he's reconciled us, his life will save us. 11All the while, we take pride in God through his Son who reconciled us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So, as through one man, sin—hence death—entered the world, death passed on to everybody because everybody has sinned. 13Before the Law, there was sin in the world, but sin isn't held against a person if there's no law. 14But, death did prevail from Adam to Moses even over the ones that hadn't sinned like Adam did—who corresponds to the One that was to come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But the gracious gift isn't like the sin. In the one case, many died because one sinned. In the other case, many received abundant grace because of God's gracious gift and the one man Jesus Christ. 16The gracious gift isn't like what came through the one sinner; the judgment that came in connection with one sin led to condemnation, but the gracious gift that came in connection with many sins led to justification. 17If death prevailed because of one man's sin, much more will life prevail—in the ones that receive abundant grace and bestowed righteousness—because of the One, Jesus Christ. 18As by the sin of one there was what led to condemnation for all people, so by one act of righteousness there is justification that leads to life for all people. 19As by one man's disobedience many became sinners, so by One man's obedience many will become righteous. 20The Law came in besides to increase sin, but where sin increased grace multiplied. 21So as sin prevailed in death, grace could prevail in righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
