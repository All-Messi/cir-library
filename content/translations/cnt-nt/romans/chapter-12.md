## Romans Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So I urge you by God's mercies to present your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God; that's your spiritual service. 2Don't conform yourselves to this world; transform yourselves by renewing your mind so you can discern what God's will is—what's good, pleasing, and perfect.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> By the grace God gave me, I say to everyone among you not to think more of yourselves than you should. Think properly as measured by the faith God has allotted to each of you. 4There are many parts to one body, and they don't all serve the same purpose. 5That's how it is with the many of us that are in Christ. Individually we're interdependent parts with one another. 6We have different gifts according to God's grace. If our gift is prophecy, let's prophesy in accordance with our faith. 7If it's service, let's carry out our commitment to him in our service. If it's teaching, let's do it in teaching. 8If it's encouraging, let's do it in encouragement. If it's sharing, let's do it liberally. If it's leading, let's do it diligently. If it's showing mercy, let's do it cheerfully.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Love has to be genuine. Hate what's bad; hold onto what's good. 10Devote yourselves to one another in brotherly love. Look up to one another in showing honor. 11Be diligent, be enthusiastic in spirit, serve the Lord. 12Rejoice in hope, endure adversity, devote yourselves to prayer, 13share in the saints' needs, show hospitality to strangers. 14Bless people that persecute you; don't curse them. 15Rejoice with those who are rejoicing; cry with those who are crying. 16Take the same attitude toward other people that you take toward yourself. Don't be proud; associate with humble people. Don't consider yourself smart. 17Don't pay back evil for evil. Be careful to do what's good in front of everybody. 18As much as comes from your part, live peacefully with everyone. 19Don't take revenge, dear friends; walk away from anger. The scripture says, "'Revenge belongs to me; I'll take care of it,' the LORD says" [Lev 19:18].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But, "If your enemy's hungry, feed him; if he's thirsty, give him a drink. If you do that, you'll pour hot coals on his head" [Pro 25:21-22].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Don't let evil overcome you; you overcome evil with good. Respect for Political Rulers</span>
