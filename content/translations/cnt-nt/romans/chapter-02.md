## Romans Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So you<sup>sg</sup> that condemn don’t have any excuse. When you condemn someone else, you condemn yourself, because you’re doing the same things. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You know it’s right for <u>God</u> to condemn people that do things like that. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Do you suppose—condemner of another while doing the same things yourself—that <u>you</u> are going to escape his condemnation? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Do you disregard his rich kindness, tolerance, and patience, and not understand that his kindness is for leading you to repentance? <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Because of your stubborn, unrepentant heart, you’re storing up displeasure for yourself when God reveals his just condemnation. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He’ll pay back every person for what they’ve done. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> wi</em><em>ll mean </em>eternal life for people who strive for glory, honor, and immortality by carrying through in good works. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>It’ll</em><em> mean </em>displeasure and anger for people that chase after injustice. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>There’ll</em><em> be</em> trouble and distress for everybody that does evil, for Jews first and for Greeks. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But <em>there’ll be</em> honor and peace for everybody that does good, for Jews first and for Greeks. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>God doesn’t play favorites: <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>as many as have sinned without having the Law will perish without <em>having</em> it; as many as have sinned under it will be condemned by it. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>It’s not who <u>hears</u> the Law that’s good, as far as God’s concerned; it’s who <u>does</u> <em>the Law</em>. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When Gentiles that don’t have the Law, naturally do what’s in it, they are governing themselves. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They show that the Law is written on their hearts. Their conscience testifies, and <em>their</em> thoughts defend or accuse one another. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>That’s</em><em> the basis for judgment</em> when God by Christ Jesus judges people’s secrets by the good news I’m presenting.</span>

### Criticism and Moral Consistency


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But if you wear the name Jew, rely on the Law, take pride in God—<strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>if</em><em> you </em>know<em> </em>his will, approve of superior things because of what the Law teaches you—<strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>if</em><em> you</em>’re confident that you’re a guide to the blind, a light to people in the dark, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the ignorant because you have the knowledge and truth that’s in the Law—<strong><sup>21</sup></strong>then do you teach others, but not learn yourself? You that preach against stealing, do you steal? <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>You that say people shouldn’t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You that detest idols, do you steal from temples? <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>You that take pride in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking it? <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><strong><em>“Gentil</em></strong><strong><em>es</em></strong><strong><em> blaspheme God because of you</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 52:5]</strong>, like the scripture says. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Circumcision benefits you if you practice <em>the</em> Law. If you transgress it, your circumcision amounts to uncircumcision. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>If then the uncircumcised keep the Law’s standards, won’t their uncircumcision be considered circumcision? <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>If the naturally uncircumcised keep the Law, won’t they condemn literal-and-circumcised transgressors of the Law? <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>It’s not the Jew outwardly that’s <em>a Jew</em>, and it’s not outward circumcision that’s <em>circumcision</em>. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>It’s the Jew inwardly that’s a Jew, and it’s the circumcision of the heart—spirit, not letter—that’s circumcision. Their praise doesn’t come from people, but from God.</span>
