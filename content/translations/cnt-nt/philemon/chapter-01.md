## Philemon Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Paul, prisoner of Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> Jesus, and brother Timothy, to our dear fellow worker Philemon, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to sister Apphia, to fellow soldier Archippus, and to your<sup>sg</sup> house church. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>I always thank God <em>for you</em>, mentioning you<sup>sg</sup> in my prayers, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>because I hear about your love and faith toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I pray that fellowshiping with your<sup>sg</sup> faith will lead to our experiencing everything good for Christ’s sake. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Brother, I’m so happy and encouraged by your love, because you refresh the hearts of the saints.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 4-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>In light of that, I feel bold enough to tell <em>you</em> something that’s appropriate. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But because I love you, I’d rather ask you to do it—being Paul the aged prisoner of Christ, and all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>I’m appealing to you about my child Onesimus that I begot while I was in bonds. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>At one time he was useless to you, but now he’s useful to you <u>and</u> to me. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>As my own heart, I’ve sent him back to you in person. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I wanted to keep him here to help me on your behalf while I’m in prison because of the good news. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent. I wanted your goodness to be because you wanted to, not because you had to. <strong><sup>15-16</sup></strong>Maybe he left you for a while so you could have him forever physically and in the Lord, not as a servant, but as a dear brother—to me too.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 8-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>So if you consider me a partner, accept him as me. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>If he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge it to me. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I, Paul, write it with my own hand: I’ll repay it. (I won’t tell you that you also owe me your very self.) <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Yes, brother, I want to have joy in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.	 <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>I’m writing, confident that you’ll do more than I’m saying. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>While you’re at it, prepare<sup>sg</sup> a place for me to stay, because I’m hoping by your<sup>pl</sup> prayers to be released to you<sup>pl</sup>.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 17-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you<sup>sg</sup> greetings. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke—my fellow workers—<em>greet you</em> <em>as well</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with your<sup>pl</sup> spirit.</span>
