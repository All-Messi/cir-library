## 1 John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> What was from the beginning, what we've heard and seen, what we've observed and touched about the living message—2the eternal life that was with the Father and he revealed to us—that's what 3we're passing along to you so we can have it in common with you as well as with the Father and his Son Jesus ChristMessiah. 4We're writing these things to you to fully share our joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The message is that God is light; there's no darkness in him at all. 6If we claim to be in fellowship with him and live in the dark, we're lying and not practicing the truth. 7If we live in the light with him, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of his Son continues to cleanse us from sin.  8-10If we claim we don't have any sin, we deceive ourselves and make God a liar. If we admit we've sinned, we can trust him to be just and forgive us of everything.</span>
