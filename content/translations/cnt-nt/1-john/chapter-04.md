## 1 John Chapter 4

### Testing the spirits

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Friends, don’t believe every <em>prophet</em> <em>that claims to speak by the</em> spirit. Test whether <em>his</em> spirit is from God; a lot of false prophets have gone out. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You can recognize that a spirit is from God by whether it agrees that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Any spirit that doesn’t, isn’t from God; it’s the antichristian <em>spirit</em> that you’ve heard is coming and is already here. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>You belong to God. You’ve triumphed over the world, because the One that’s in you is greater than the one that’s in it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>False leaders belong to the world, so they speak of it, and it listens to them. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>We belong to God; people that know him listen to us. People that don’t belong to him, don’t listen to us. That’s how you can tell if <em>a prophet has the </em>true spirit or a deceiving one.    <strong>1 Jn 4:1-6</strong> 	<strong>God is Love</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Let’s love each other because love comes from God, and everybody that loves has been begotten by him and knows him. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>People that don’t love don’t know God because he is <em>characterized by</em> love. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>God showed that love by sending his only Son into the world so we could have life through him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Love is not so much that we love <u>God</u> as that he’s loved <u>us</u> and sent his Son as a basis for forgiving our sins. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>If God loved us that much, we should love each other. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Nobody has ever seen God; <em>but</em> if we love each other, he’s in us and his love has accomplished its purpose in us.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 4:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> We know he’s in us and we’re in him by the spirit he’s given us. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We’ve seen and speak to the fact that the Father has sent the Son to save the world. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If anybody agrees that Jesus is God’s Son, God’s in him and he’s in God. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>We’ve known and believed that God has put his love in us. God is <em>characterized by </em>love and whoever keeps loving keeps being in God and God keeps being in him. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Love ends up giving us confidence at judgment time because we’re like he was in the world. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>There’s no fear in love; perfect love eliminates fear because fear corresponds with punishment; whoever is afraid has not become perfect at loving. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Let’s love because he loved us first. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>If people say they love God and hate fellow Christians, they’re not telling the truth. If they don’t love Christians they’ve seen, they can’t be loving God they’ve not seen. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>We have this commandment from him: whoever loves God must love God’s children too.</span>
