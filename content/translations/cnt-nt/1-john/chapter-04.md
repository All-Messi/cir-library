## 1 John Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Friends, don't believe every prophet that claims to speak by the spirit. Test whether his spirit is from God; a lot of false prophets have gone out. 2You can recognize that a spirit is from God by whether it agrees that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. 3Any spirit that doesn't, isn't from God; it's the antichristian spirit that you've heard is coming and is already here. 4You belong to God. You've triumphed over the world, because the One that's in you is greater than the one that's in it. 5False leaders belong to the world, so they speak of it, and it listens to them. 6We belong to God; people that know him listen to us. People that don't belong to him, don't listen to us. That's how you can tell if a prophet has the true spirit or a deceiving one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Let's love each other because love comes from God, and everybody that loves has been begotten by him and knows him. 8People that don't love don't know God because he is characterized by love. 9God showed that love by sending his only Son into the world so we could have life through him. 10Love is not so much that we love God as that he's loved us and sent his Son as a basis for forgiving our sins. 11If God loved us that much, we should love each other. 12Nobody has ever seen God; but if we love each other, he's in us and his love has accomplished its purpose in us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> We know he's in us and we're in him by the spirit he's given us. 14We've seen and speak to the fact that the Father has sent the Son to save the world. 15If anybody agrees that Jesus is God's Son, God's in him and he's in God. 16We've known and believed that God has put his love in us. God is characterized by love and whoever keeps loving keeps being in God and God keeps being in him. 17Love ends up giving us confidence at judgment time because we're like he was in the world. 18There's no fear in love; perfect love eliminates fear because fear corresponds with punishment; whoever is afraid has not become perfect at loving. 19Let's love because he loved us first. 20If people say they love God and hate fellow Christians, they're not telling the truth. If they don't love Christians they've seen, they can't be loving God they've not seen. 21We have this commandment from him: whoever loves God must love God's children too.</span>
