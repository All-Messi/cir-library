## 1 John Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Look at what special love the Father has extended to us in calling us his children. The world doesn’t know us because it didn’t know him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>We’re God’s children now. It’s not clear what we <u>will</u> be, but we do know that when <em>Christ</em> returns, we’ll be <u>like</u> him and see him as he is. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Everybody that has that hope keeps himself pure like <u>he</u> is.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Everybody that practices sin is practicing lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You know he came to take away sins; there’s no sin in him. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Nobody that’s in him practices sin. If they do, they haven’t known him or seen him. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Little children, don’t let anybody mislead you. Whoever <u>does</u> good <u>is</u> good—like <u>he</u> is. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Whoever does evil is like the devil because he’s been sinning since the beginning. The Son of God came to destroy what the devil does. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>None of the ones God begets practices sin because <em>God’s</em> seed stays in them. They can’t be sinning because <u>God’s</u> begotten them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>That’s how you can tell God’s children from the devil’s. Anybody that doesn’t <u>practice</u> goodness or care about fellow believers, doesn’t belong to God.<strong></span>

### Love One Another


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You’ve heard all along that we should love each other <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and not be like Cain. The evil one influenced him, and he murdered his brother. Why’d he do it? Because what his <u>brother</u> did was good, and what <u>he</u> did was bad. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Don’t be surprised if the world hates you. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We’ve come from death to life because we love fellow Christians. People that hate fellow Christians are still dead. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They <em>amount to</em> being murderers <em>like Cain</em>, and murderers don’t have eternal life. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>We’ve known what love is because he showed us by laying his life down for us, and we should lay our lives down for our fellow Christians. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>How can God’s love be in anyone that has this world’s possessions, sees what a brother or sister needs, and turns off sympathy for them? <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Little children, let’s not <u>talk</u> about love; let’s <u>do</u> it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 3:11-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> We can have confidence in his presence <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>even if we feel guilty. God’s greater than our feelings and knows everything. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>If our conscience doesn’t make us feel guilty, we’re confident in front of him, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and he gives us what we ask for because we do what pleases him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He has told us to believe in his Son Jesus Christ and love each other. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When we do that, he lives in us and we in him. We know he’s in us by the spirit he’s given us.</span>
