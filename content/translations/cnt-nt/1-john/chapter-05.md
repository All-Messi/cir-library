## 1 John Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Everybody that believes Jesus is the ChristMessiah has been begotten by God, and everybody that loves the begetter loves the begotten. 2We can tell we love God's children by whether we love God and do what he says. 3Loving God means keeping his commandments without feeling like they're burdensome. 4The ones God begets triumph over the world, and faith makes that triumph possible. 5Who triumphs over the world except the one that believes Jesus is God's Son?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jesus Christ came by water (at his baptism) and blood (on his cross), not just by water. The Spirit is the One that bears witness, because the Spirit is characterized by truth. 7There are three witnesses: 8the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and they agree. 9We accept what people tell us; what God tells us is more important. God has told us about his Son. 10Whoever believes in his Son accepts what God has told us; whoever doesn't, makes God a liar. 11God has told us that eternal life lies in the Son. 12Whoever has the Son has that life; whoever doesn't have him, doesn't have it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I've written these things to you that believe in God's Son in order to make you confident that you have eternal life. 14This is the confidence we have with him: whatever we ask for according to his will he listens to. 15If we know he listens to what we ask for, we know he answers what we ask for.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> If you see a fellow believer doing some sin that doesn't lead to death, ask God and he'll give him life. There is a kind of sin that does lead to death; I'm not saying you should ask about that. 17All unrighteousness is sin, but there are sins that don't lead to death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> People that God begets don't practice sinning; they keep themselves from sinning, and the evil one doesn't touch them. 19We belong to God, and the world belongs to the evil one. 20God's Son came so we could understand what's true. We're in the true One, God's Son Jesus Christ. He's true deity and eternal life. 21Little children, stay away from idols.</span>
