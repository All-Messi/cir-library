## 1 John Chapter 5

### Victory by Faith

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Elder to Gaius, that I truly love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jesus Christ came by water (<em>at his baptism</em>)<em> </em>and blood (<em>on his cross</em>), not just by water. The Spirit is the One that bears witness, because the Spirit is <em>characterized by</em> truth. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>There are three witnesses: <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and they agree. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We accept what people tell us; what God tells us is more important. God has told us about his Son. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Whoever believes in his Son accepts what <em>God</em> has told us; whoever doesn’t, makes God a liar. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>God has told us that eternal life lies in the Son. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Whoever has the Son has <em>that </em>life; whoever doesn’t have him, doesn’t have it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 5:6-12</p>

### Confidence in Christ


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I’ve had so much I want to tell you<sup>sg</sup> but not in writing. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I hope to see you soon and speak to you in person. Peace to you. Your friends send their greetings. Greet your friends by name.</span>
<p class="section-ref">3 Jn 13-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> If you see a fellow believer doing some sin that doesn’t lead to death, ask God and he’ll give him life. There <u>is</u> a kind of sin that does lead to death; I’m not saying you should ask about that. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>All unrighteousness is sin, but there are sins that don’t lead to death.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 5:16-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> People that God begets don’t practice sinning; they keep themselves <em>from sinning</em>, and the evil one doesn’t touch them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>We belong to God, and the world belongs to the evil one. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God’s Son came so we could understand what’s true. We’re in the true One, <em>God’s</em> Son Jesus Christ. <u>H</u><u>e</u>’s true deity and eternal life. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Little children, stay away from idols.             <strong>1 Jn 5:18-21</span>
