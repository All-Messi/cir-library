## 1 John Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Everybody that believes Jesus is the Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> has been begotten by God, and everybody that loves the begetter loves the begotten. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>We can tell we love God’s children by whether we love God and do what he says. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Loving God means keeping his commandments without feeling like they’re burdensome. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The ones God begets triumph over the world, and faith makes that triumph possible. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Who triumphs over the world except the one that believes Jesus is God’s Son?</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 5:1-5</p>

### Witnesses for Christ


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Jesus Christ came by water (<em>at his baptism</em>)<em> </em>and blood (<em>on his cross</em>), not just by water. The Spirit is the One that bears witness, because the Spirit is <em>characterized by</em> truth. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>There are three witnesses: <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and they agree. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We accept what people tell us; what God tells us is more important. God has told us about his Son. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Whoever believes in his Son accepts what <em>God</em> has told us; whoever doesn’t, makes God a liar. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>God has told us that eternal life lies in the Son. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Whoever has the Son has <em>that </em>life; whoever doesn’t have him, doesn’t have it.</span>

### Confidence in Christ


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>I’ve written these things to you that believe in God’s Son in order to make you confident that you have eternal life. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>This is the confidence we have with him: whatever we ask for according to his will he listens to. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If we know he <u>listens to</u> what we ask for, we know he <u>answers</u> what we ask for.<strong>   </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 5:13-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>If you see a fellow believer doing some sin that doesn’t lead to death, ask God and he’ll give him life. There <u>is</u> a kind of sin that does lead to death; I’m not saying you should ask about that. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>All unrighteousness is sin, but there are sins that don’t lead to death.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 5:16-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>People that God begets don’t practice sinning; they keep themselves <em>from sinning</em>, and the evil one doesn’t touch them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>We belong to God, and the world belongs to the evil one. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God’s Son came so we could understand what’s true. We’re in the true One, <em>God’s</em> Son Jesus Christ. <u>H</u><u>e</u>’s true deity and eternal life. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Little children, stay away from idols.</span>
