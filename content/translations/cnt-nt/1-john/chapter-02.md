## 1 John Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>My little children, I’m writing so you’ll continue not to sin. If any of us <u>do</u> sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Just. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He’s the basis for forgiving <u>our</u> sins as well as the sins of the whole world. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We can tell we know him by whether we’re keeping his commandments. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If we claim to know him<em> </em>but don’t obey him, we’re not telling the truth and don’t have it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>If we keep God’s word, we really have loved God completely. That’s how we can tell we’re in him. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>If we claim to be in him, we should be like him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 2:1-6</p>

### Love, the New Commandment


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Friends, I’m not telling you anything new; it’s what you’ve heard all along. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then again, I <u>am</u> saying something new, something that’s true in him and us: darkness is disappearing, and true light is already shining. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>People that claim to be enlightened and hate fellow believers are still in the dark. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They don’t know where they’re going because they can’t see in the dark. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Whoever loves a fellow believer is in the light and doesn’t make people stumble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>I’m writing to you little children because he’s forgiven your sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>I’m writing to you fathers because you’ve known the One that’s from the beginning. I’m writing to you young men because you’ve overcome the evil one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><u>I’ve</u><u> written</u> to you children because you’ve known the Father. <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	 </sup></strong>  <u>I’ve written</u> to you fathers because you’ve known the One that’s from the beginning. I’ve written to you young men because you’re strong; God’s message remains in you, and you’ve overcome the evil one.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 2:7-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Don’t love the world or what’s in it. Loving the world means not loving the Father. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Nothing worldly comes from the Father; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life come from the world. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The world will pass away along with its lust, but whoever does God’s will lasts forever.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 2:15-17</p>

### The Antichrist


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Little children, we’re in the last hour. You’ve heard that antichrist is coming, and lots of antichrists have already come; so we know we’re in the last hour. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Some people have left us, but they weren’t part of us, or they would’ve stayed; leaving us shows they weren’t part of us. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know <em>what</em><em> you need to know</em>. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>I’m not writing to tell you something you don’t know, but because you <u>do</u> know it and because there’s a difference between false and true. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Who’s telling what’s false if it’s not someone that denies Jesus is the Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>? It’s the antichrist that denies the Father and the Son. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Nobody that denies the Son has the Father either; anybody that acknowledges the Son has both. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Let what you’ve heard from the beginning stick with you. If you do, you’ll continue to be in the Son and the Father, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and you’ll have the eternal life he promised.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>I’m writing about the ones that are trying to mislead you. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The anointing you received from him is still in you; you don’t need anybody to teach you <em>any</em><em>thing more</em>. His anointing is correct and complete. Stick with what he taught you <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>so when he returns, you’ll feel confident, not ashamed. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>If you know he’s good, you know he’s begotten everyone that’s good.</span>
