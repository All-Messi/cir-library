## 1 John Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My little children, I'm writing so you'll continue not to sin. If any of us do sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Just. 2He's the basis for forgiving our sins as well as the sins of the whole world. 3We can tell we know him by whether we're keeping his commandments. 4If we claim to know him but don't obey him, we're not telling the truth and don't have it. 5If we keep God's word, we really have loved God completely. That's how we can tell we're in him. 6If we claim to be in him, we should be like him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Friends, I'm not telling you anything new; it's what you've heard all along. 8Then again, I am saying something new, something that's true in him and us: darkness is disappearing, and true light is already shining. 9People that claim to be enlightened and hate fellow believers are still in the dark. 11They don't know where they're going because they can't see in the dark. 10Whoever loves a fellow believer is in the light and doesn't make people stumble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'm writing to you little children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'm writing to you fathers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I've written to you children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Don't love the world or what's in it. Loving the world means not loving the Father. 16Nothing worldly comes from the Father; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life come from the world. 17The world will pass away along with its lust, but whoever does God's will lasts forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Little children, we're in the last hour. You've heard that antichrist is coming, and lots of antichrists have already come; so we know we're in the last hour. 19Some people have left us, but they weren't part of us, or they would've stayed; leaving us shows they weren't part of us. 20You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know what you need to know. 21I'm not writing to tell you something you don't know, but because you do know it and because there's a difference between false and true. 22Who's telling what's false if it's not someone that denies Jesus is the ChristMessiah? It's the antichrist that denies the Father and the Son. 23Nobody that denies the Son has the Father either; anybody that acknowledges the Son has both. 24Let what you've heard from the beginning stick with you. If you do, you'll continue to be in the Son and the Father, 25and you'll have the eternal life he promised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I'm writing about the ones that are trying to mislead you. 27The anointing you received from him is still in you; you don't need anybody to teach you anything more. His anointing is correct and complete. Stick with what he taught you 28so when he returns, you'll feel confident, not ashamed. 29If you know he's good, you know he's begotten everyone that's good.</span>
