## Acts Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Agrippa said to Paul, "You can speak for yourself." 2"In light of the things the Jews accused me of, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to present my own defense today, 3especially since you're familiar with Jewish customs and issues. So please listen patiently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The Jews know my way of life from my youth, which I spent in my own nation in Jerusalem. 5If they're willing to admit it, they know I lived before as a Pharisee, the strictest sect of our religion. 6Now I stand in judgment for having hope in God's promise to our ancestors. 7Our twelve tribes sincerely hope to obtain that promise as they serve God every day. In regard to that hope, the Jews are accusing me. 8Why do youpl consider it unbelievable that God raises the dead? 9At one time I thought I needed to do a lot of things against Jesus the Nazarene. 10That's what I did in Jerusalem. Not only did I lock up many saints in jail with authority from the chief priests; but when they were being sentenced to execution, I voted against them. 11I punished them often in every synagogue and tried to make them blaspheme. I was insanely furious and persecuted them even to foreign cities. 12"In that effort, I was traveling to Damascus with authority from the chief priests. 13In the middle of the day, King Agrippa, I saw a light from the sky brighter than the sun, shining around me and the ones that were with me. 14When we'd fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It's hard for you to keep kicking against the goads.' "I'm Jesus that you're persecuting. 16Get up. I've appeared to you to appoint you as a witness to what you've seen and what I'll show you. 17I'll protect you from the people and from the Gentiles, where I'm sending you. 18Open their eyes so they'll turn from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, so they'll receive forgiveness and an inheritance among the ones that become holy by trusting in me." 19"So, King Agrippa, I obeyed the heavenly vision. 20First to the people in Damascus, Jerusalem, and Judaea, then to the Gentiles, I continually declared they should repent toward God and do what's appropriate to repentance. 21That's why some Jews grabbed me in the Temple and tried to murder me. 22I've obtained help from God till today and speak to small and great simply what the Prophets and Moses said would happen: 23the Messiah needed to suffer, and by resurrection he would present light first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> While Paul was delivering his defense, Festus shouted, "Paul, your extensive learning is driving you crazy!" 25"I'm not crazy, most excellent Festus; I'm speaking sensible truth. 26The king that I'm confidently speaking to, knows about these matters. I'm sure none of it has escaped his attention; it didn't happen off in a corner somewhere. 27King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Agrippa said, "With a little urging are you trying to persuade me to become a Christian?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Paul said, "I wish to God, whether by little or much, you and everybody listening today would become like me except for these bonds."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The king, the governor, Bernice, and those sitting with them got up. 31When they'd gone aside, they said to one another, "He hasn't done anything that deserves bonds or death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Agrippa told Festus, "He could've been released if he hadn't appealed to Caesar."</span>
