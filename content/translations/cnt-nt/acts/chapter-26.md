## Acts Chapter **26**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Agrippa said to Paul, <em>“You can speak for yourself.”</em> Paul stretched out his hand, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“In</em><em> </em><em>light of</em><em> the things the Jews accused me of, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to present my own defense today, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>especially</em><em> since you’re familiar with Jewish customs and issues.</em><em> </em><em>So please listen patiently.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> Jews know my way of life </em><em>from my youth, which I spent in my own </em><em>nation in Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> they</em><em>’re willing to admit it, they know</em><em> I lived before as a Pharisee</em><em>, </em><em>the strictest sect of our religion.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> I stand in judgment for</em><em> </em><em>having hope in</em><em> </em><em>God’s</em><em> promise to our </em><em>ancestors</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Our</em><em> </em><em>twelve tribes </em><em>sincerely</em><em> hope to obtain </em><em>that promise </em><em>as they serve God </em><em>every </em><em>day</em><em>. </em><em>I</em><em>n regard to</em><em> that hope, the Jews are accusing me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Why</em><em> do </em><em>you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> consider it unbe</em><em>lievable that</em><em> God raises the </em><em>dead?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>A</em><em>t</em><em> one time I thought I needed to do </em><em>a lot</em><em> of things against Jesus the Nazarene.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That’s</em><em> what I did in Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><em>Not only did I lock up </em><em>many saints in jail with authority from</em><em> the chief priests; but when they were being sentenced to execution, I voted against them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> punished them often in every synagogue and tried to </em><em>make them</em><em> blaspheme.</em><em> I was insanely furious and</em><em> persecuted them even </em><em>to</em><em> foreign cities.</em><em>	 </em></span>

### The Third Account of Paul’s Conversion 12“In that effort, I was traveling to Damascus with authority from the chief priests. 13In the middle of the day, King Agrippa, I saw a light from the sky brighter than the sun, shining around me and the ones that were with me. 14When we’d fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking in Hebrew, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It’s hard for you to keep kicking against the goads.’  		15“I said, ‘Who are you, Sir?’  	“I’m Jesus that you’re persecuting. 16Get up. I’ve appeared to you to appoint you as a witness to what you’ve seen and what I’ll show you. 17I’ll protect you from the people and from the Gentiles, where I’m sending you. 18Open their eyes so they’ll turn from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, so they’ll receive forgiveness and an inheritance among the ones that become holy by trusting in me.”						     19“So, King Agrippa, I obeyed the heavenly vision. 20First to the people in Damascus, Jerusalem, and Judaea, then to the Gentiles, I continually declared they should repent toward God and do what’s appropriate to repentance. 21That’s why some Jews grabbed me in the Temple and tried to murder me. 22I’ve obtained help from God till today and speak to small and great simply what the Prophets and Moses said would happen: 23the Messiah needed to suffer, and by resurrection he would present light first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles.”                    	Acts 26:12-23 Paul Appeals to Agrippa to Believe


<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>While Paul was delivering his defense, Festus shouted, <em>“Paul, your </em><em>extensive</em><em> learning is driving you </em><em>crazy!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>“I’m</em><em> not </em><em>crazy</em><em>, most excellent Festus; I’m speaking sensible truth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>he</em><em> king </em><em>that I’m confidently speaking </em><em>to,</em><em> knows</em><em> about these matters.</em><em> </em><em>I’m sure none of </em><em>it</em><em> </em><em>has escaped his</em><em> </em><em>attention</em><em>; </em><em>it</em><em> didn’t happen </em><em>off </em><em>in a corner</em><em> somewhere</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>King</em><em> Agrippa, do you </em><em>believe</em><em> the prophets?</em><em> </em><em>I know you do.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Agrippa said, <em>“With a little </em>urging <em>are you trying to persuade me to become a </em><em>Christ</em><em>ian?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Paul said, <em>“I wish to God</em><em>,</em><em> whether by little or much, </em><em>you and</em><em> everybody listening today would become like me except for these bonds.”</em><em>                              </em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	    </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>The king, the governor, Bernice, and those sitting with them got up. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>When they’d gone aside, they said to one another, <em>“</em><em>He hasn’t done anything that deserves</em><em> bonds or death.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>Agrippa told Festus, <em>“He could’ve been released if he hadn’t appealed to Caesar.”</em> <em>	</em></span>
