## Acts Chapter 20

### Paul Travels Through Macedonia and Greece

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After the uproar, Paul sent for the disciples. When he’d encouraged them and said goodbye, he left for Macedonia. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>After he passed through that area and encouraged them a lot, he went to Greece <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>for three months. The Jews laid a plot against him as he was getting ready to sail to Syria; so he decided to go back through Macedonia. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>With him were Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea; the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy, and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><u>They</u> went on ahead and waited for us in Troas. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>After the days of Unleavened Bread, <u>we</u> sailed from Philippi and met them in Troas in five days and stayed seven.</span>

### Paul’s Farewell to Troas


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> On the first day of the week, when we got together to break bread, Paul started speaking, He intended to leave in the morning and kept speaking till midnight. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Quite a few lamps were in the upstairs room where we gathered. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>A young man named Eutychus was sitting on the windowsill. As Paul kept speaking for a long time, Eutychus went sound asleep and fell from the third floor. They picked him up for dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When Paul went down, he knelt beside him, took him in his arms, and said, <em>“Don’t worry; he’s alive.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He went back up and broke the bread and ate. After he talked for a long time till daybreak, he went out directly like he was. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They brought the boy alive and were really relieved.</span>

### Paul Sails from Troas to Miletus


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> We went on ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, intending to pick up Paul there. That’s the arrangement he’d made; he planned to go on foot himself. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We took him on board at Assos and went on to Mitylene. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>From there, we arrived the following day across from Chios, the next day came near Samos, and the day after that made it to Miletus. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus to keep from spending time in Asia. He was pushing to get to Jerusalem by Pentecost if he could.</span>

### Paul Addresses the Ephesians


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the church elders. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When they came, he said, <em>“</em><em>F</em><em>rom the day I </em><em>first came to</em><em> Asia, </em><em>y</em><em>ou know how I </em><em>operat</em><em>ed among</em><em> you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> served</em><em> the Lord with humility, tears, and trials that came on me from plots by the Jews.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> </em><em>told</em><em> you everything profitable</em><em> as I taught</em><em> you publicly and from house to house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>To</em><em> Jews and Greeks I solemnly preached repentance toward God and </em><em>trust</em><em> in our Lord Jesus.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> I’</em><em>m determined to go to Jerusalem. I don’t know what will happen there. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>n</em><em> every city </em><em>t</em><em>he Holy Spirit declares that bonds and sufferings are waiting</em><em> for me</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> I don’t consider my life of any value to </em><em>myself,</em><em> so I can finish my course in the ministry I received from the Lord—to </em><em>speak</em><em> the good news about God’s grace.</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 20:17-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> <em>“Now</em><em> I’ve </em><em>presented God’s kingdom among you, and I know you </em><em>won’t see me again</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> I tell you today, I’m innocent of </em><em>everybody’s</em><em> blood.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> </em><em>explained</em><em> to you </em><em>God’s</em><em> whole plan.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>Pay</em><em> attention to yourselves and the flock the Holy Spirit has </em><em>given you to oversee. S</em><em>hepherd </em><em>God’s</em><em> church that he bought with </em><em>the blood of his own Son</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>After</em><em> I leave, I know fierce wolves </em><em>are going to come in and not spare</em><em> the flock.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>Even</em><em> from </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>, men will </em><em>rise up</em><em> and say</em><em> perverse things to lure away disciples.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> pay attention; remember that for three years day and night I warned each one with tears.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> I entrust you to God and his grace.</em><em> </em><em>It can build you up and provide </em><em>you</em><em> an inheritance among the sanctified.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> haven’t coveted anybody’s gold, silver, or clothes.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> know these hands have provided for my needs and th</em><em>e ones</em><em> </em><em>that were </em><em>with me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> everything I’ve shown you that by working this way you </em><em>should help the weak and </em><em>remember the words of the Lord Jesus, </em>‘It’s more blessed to give than to receive<em>.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Then he knelt down with them and prayed. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They began to cry out loud, hug him, and kiss him. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>They grieved especially over his comment that they wouldn’t see him again. They went with him to the ship.</span>
