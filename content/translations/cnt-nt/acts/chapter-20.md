## Acts Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After the uproar, Paul sent for the disciples. When he’d encouraged them and said goodbye, he left for Macedonia. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>After he passed through that area and encouraged them a lot, he went to Greece <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>for three months. The Jews laid a plot against him as he was getting ready to sail to Syria; so he decided to go back through Macedonia. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>With him were Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea; the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy, and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><u>They</u> went on ahead and waited for us in Troas. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>After the days of Unleavened Bread, <u>we</u> sailed from Philippi and met them in Troas in five days and stayed seven.</span>

### Paul’s Farewell to Troas


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>On the first day of the week, when we got together to break bread, Paul started speaking, He intended to leave in the morning and kept speaking till midnight. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Quite a few lamps were in the upstairs room where we gathered. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>A young man named Eutychus was sitting on the windowsill. As Paul kept speaking for a long time, Eutychus went sound asleep and fell from the third floor. They picked him up for dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When Paul went down, he knelt beside him, took him in his arms, and said, <em>“Don’t worry; he’s alive.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He went back up and broke the bread and ate. After he talked for a long time till daybreak, he went out directly like he was. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They brought the boy alive and were really relieved.</span>

### Paul Sails from Troas to Miletus


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>We went on ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, intending to pick up Paul there. That’s the arrangement he’d made; he planned to go on foot himself. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We took him on board at Assos and went on to Mitylene. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>From there, we arrived the following day across from Chios, the next day came near Samos, and the day after that made it to Miletus. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus to keep from spending time in Asia. He was pushing to get to Jerusalem by Pentecost if he could.</span>

### Paul Addresses the Ephesians


<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the church elders. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When they came, he said, <em>“</em><em>F</em><em>rom the day I </em><em>first came to</em><em> Asia, </em><em>y</em><em>ou know how I </em><em>operat</em><em>ed among</em><em> you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> served</em><em> the Lord with humility, tears, and trials that came on me from plots by the Jews.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> </em><em>told</em><em> you everything profitable</em><em> as I taught</em><em> you publicly and from house to house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>To</em><em> Jews and Greeks I solemnly preached repentance toward God and </em><em>trust</em><em> in our Lord Jesus.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> I’</em><em>m determined to go to Jerusalem. I don’t know what will happen there. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>n</em><em> every city </em><em>t</em><em>he Holy Spirit declares that bonds and sufferings are waiting</em><em> for me</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> I don’t consider my life of any value to </em><em>myself,</em><em> so I can finish my course in the ministry I received from the Lord—to </em><em>speak</em><em> the good news about God’s grace.</em><em>    </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 20:17-24</p>

### 25“Now I’ve presented God’s kingdom among you, and I know you won’t see me again. 26So I tell you today, I’m innocent of everybody’s blood. 27I’ve explained to you God’s whole plan. 28Pay attention to yourselves and the flock the Holy Spirit has given you to oversee. Shepherd God’s church that he bought with the blood of his own Son. 29After I leave, I know fierce wolves are going to come in and not spare the flock. 30Even from you, men will rise up and say perverse things to lure away disciples. 31So pay attention; remember that for three years day and night I warned each one with tears. 32Now I entrust you to God and his grace. It can build you up and provide you an inheritance among the sanctified. 33I haven’t coveted anybody’s gold, silver, or clothes. 34You know these hands have provided for my needs and the ones that were with me. 35In everything I’ve shown you that by working this way you should help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, ‘It’s more blessed to give than to receive.’”


<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>Then he knelt down with them and prayed. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They began to cry out loud, hug him, and kiss him. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>They grieved especially over his comment that they wouldn’t see him again. They went with him to the ship.</span>
