## Acts Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Saul was approving of his death.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 7:54-8</p>

### :1a Paul Leads a General Persecution Severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem. Disciples scattered all over Judaea and Samaria—except for the apostles. 2Devout men buried Stephen and mourned him greatly. 3Saul continued to destroy the church, entering every house, dragging men and women to jail.	       Acts 8:1b-3 Philip Preaches to Samaritans


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The ones that scattered went around presenting the message. 5Philip went down to the city of Samaria and presented the Messiah to them. 6The crowds paid attention to what he said and to the signs he did. 7Unclean spirits came out crying loudly, and he healed paralyzed and lame people. 8A lot of joy came to that city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A man named Simon had previously practiced sorcery in the city. He amazed the Samaritan nation, claiming to be somebody great. 10Least to greatest looked up to him, "This is The Power of God Called Great." 11They looked up to him because for a long time he had amazed them with sorcery. 12When they believed Philip's preaching about God's kingdom and about Jesus as the Messiah, men and women were baptized. 13Simon himself believed and after his baptism he stayed close to Philip, impressed with his outstanding miraculous signs. Peter and John in Samaria</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard the Samaritans had accepted God's message, they sent Peter and John 15to go down and pray for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit. 16The Spirit hadn't fallen on any of them; they'd only been baptized into the Lord Jesus. 17The apostles laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When Simon saw that the apostles were giving the Spirit by laying on hands, he offered them money, 19"Give me that authority, too, so whoever I lay my hands on will receive the Spirit."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Peter told him, "Your silver perish with you! You thought you could buy God's gift with money! 21You don't have any part in this. Your motives aren't right in front of God. 22Repent of this wickedness and pray that maybe he'll forgive your motives. 23As far as I'm concerned, you're in the bitterness that gall has and the addiction that sinning brings."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Simon answered, "Youpl pray to the Lord for me so nothing like that happens to me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> When they'd given their testimony and presented the Lord's message, they headed back to Jerusalem. On the way they delivered the good news to many Samaritan villages. Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> An angel of the LORD told Philip, "Go south to the road from Jerusalem down to Gaza, which is open country." 27So he went. An Ethiopian, a eunuch, an official, the treasurer for Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. had come to Jerusalem to worship and 28was going back in his carriage, reading the prophet Isaiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The Spirit told Philip, "Make contact with that carriage."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Philip ran toward it and heard him reading Isaiah, "Do you understand what you're reading?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> "How can I unless somebody explains it me?" He invited Philip to come up and sit with him in the carriage. 32This is the passage he was reading: "They led him like a sheep to slaughter; like a lamb silent in front of its shearers, he didn't open his mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> In his humble condition he received no justice. Who can speak of his descendants? his life has been taken from the earth?" [Is 53:7-8 LXX]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> The eunuch asked, "Who's the prophet talking about, himself or somebody else?" 35Philip started at that scripture and presented to him the good news about Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> As they rode along, they came to some water, the eunuch said, "Here's some water; why can't I be baptized?" [37]ms 38He stopped the carriage, and they both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. 39When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the LORD caught Philip away, and the eunuch never saw him again. He went on his way happy. 40Philip showed up in Azotus. As he traveled, he delivered the good news to towns all along the way to Caesarea. Saul's Conversion</span>
