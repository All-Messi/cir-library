## Acts Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense." 2When they heard him speaking Hebrew, they got quieter. 3"I'm a Jew; I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia but raised in this city. I was educated under Gamaliel strictly according to the law of our ancestors and was as zealous for God as you are today. 4I persecuted The Way to death, binding and jailing men and women 5as the high priest and presbytery can confirm. I got letters to go to Damascus and bind the ones that had gone there and extradite them to Jerusalem to punish them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> As I got close to Damascus about noon, a bright light suddenly shined around me. 7I fell on the ground and heard a voice, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' 9"The ones that were with me saw the light but couldn't make out what he was saying to me. 11"When I couldn't see from the brilliance of that light, the ones that were with me led me by the hand into Damascus. 12"A man was there named Ananias. He was devout according to the Law, a man the Jews living there vouched for. 13He came and stood by me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.' I looked at him that very hour. 14"He said, 'Our ancestors' God chose you ahead of time to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear him. 15You're to speak for him to all people about what you've seen and heard. 16Now why wait? Get baptized and wash your sins away, calling on him.' 17"When I came back to Jerusalem and was praying in the Temple, I fell into a trance, 18and saw him telling me, 'Get out of Jerusalem now; they won't accept your testimony about me.' 19"I said, 'Lord, they know that in every synagogue I was jailing people in bonds who believed in you. 20When Stephen your witness shed his blood, I stood by approving and keeping the clothes for the ones that were killing him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They listened that far, but then they started shouting, "Away with such a fellow. Don't let him live!" 23They started yelling and tearing their clothes and throwing dust in the air. 24The tribune ordered the soldiers to bring him into the barracks and interrogate him by scourging to find out why they were shouting about him that way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> As they were stretching him out with straps, Paul said to the centurion supervising, "Is it legal to scourge a Roman that hasn't been condemned?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune, "What are you doing? This man's a Roman!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The tribune came and said, "Tell me, are you a Roman?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> He responded, "This citizenship cost me a lot of money."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> At once the ones that were going to interrogate him stepped away. The tribune was worried when he found out Paul was a Roman and he'd bound him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The next day he was still wanting to know why the Jews were accusing Paul. The tribune took off Paul's bonds and commanded the chief priests and full Sanhedrin to meet. He took Paul down and put him in front of them.</span>
