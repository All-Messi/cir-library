## Acts Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>“Brothers</em><em> and fathers, listen to my defense.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When they heard him speaking Hebrew, they got quieter. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“I’m</em><em> a Jew;</em><em> </em>I was <em>born in</em><em> Tarsus in</em><em> Cilicia but raised </em><em>in this city. I was educated under</em><em> Gamaliel strict</em><em>ly according to the law of our ancestors and was as</em><em> zealous for God as you are today.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> persecuted The Way to death, binding and </em><em>jail</em><em>ing men and women </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>as</em><em> the high priest and presbytery can </em><em>confirm</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I </em><em>got</em><em> letters to go to Damascus and bind the ones </em><em>that had gone</em><em> there and extradite them to Jerusalem to punish them.</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 22:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Paul said, <em>“God</em><em>’s going to </em><em>slap you, you whitewashed wall!</em><em> </em><em>You</em><em> sit judging me by the Law and </em><em>command </em><em>them to slap me in violation of the L</em><em>aw.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The ones that were standing there said, <em>“You insult God’s high priest?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Paul said, <em>“Brothers, I </em><em>was not aware that</em><em> he was </em><em>a </em><em>high priest.</em><em> The scripture does say</em><em>,</em> <strong><em>‘Don’t</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>say</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>bad things about a ruler of your people</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>”</em> <strong>[Ex</strong><strong> </strong><strong>22:28]</strong>.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### -23:5


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Knowing one part was Sadducees and the other was Pharisees, he started shouting, <em>“</em><em>I’m a Pharisee, the son of </em><em>a Pharisee! I’m on trial for having</em><em> h</em><em>ope in the</em><em> resurrection!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Dissension erupted between the Pharisees and Sadducees. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Sadducees say there’s no resurrection, angel, or spirit; Pharisees profess them all. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>During the uproar, some scribes from the Pharisees’ party stood up, protesting violently, <em>“We don’t find anything wrong with this man</em><em>! </em><em>What if a spirit or angel spoke to him?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>As the conflict grew, the tribune was afraid they’d tear Paul limb from limb. He commanded the troops to rescue him and bring him back into the barracks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>That night the Lord stood by him, <em>“Don’t be afraid.</em><em> </em><em>As you’ve </em><em>spoken</em><em> </em><em>for</em><em> me in Jerusalem, you need to </em><em>speak </em>for me<em> in </em><em>Rome.”</em><em>	</em></span>

### Jewish Plot to Kill Paul


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The next day, some Jews took a binding oath not to eat or drink till they’d killed Paul. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>More</span>
<p class="section-ref">than 40</p>

### men instigated that plot. 14They came to the chief priests and elders, “We’ve taken a binding oath not to taste anything till we’ve killed Paul. 15Now you and the Sanhedrin inform the tribune to bring him down as if to find out more accurately the issues about him. Before he gets close, we’re prepared to kill him.”


<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Paul’s nephew heard about the ambush, went into the barracks, and let Paul know. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Paul called a centurion, <em>“Take this young man to the tribune; he has something to </em><em>tell him</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>He took him to the tribune,<em> “The prisoner Paul asked me</em><em> to bring you this young man. H</em><em>e has something to tell you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The tribune took his hand and withdrew privately, “<em>What do you have to report?”</em><em>	</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Som</em><em>e</em><em> Jews have agreed </em><em>together </em><em>to ask you to </em><em>take</em><em> Paul down into the Sanhedrin tomorrow as if to ask something more accurately about him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> let them persuade you.</em><em> </em><em>More than </em><em>40</em><em> of them are lying in </em><em>ambush. They’</em><em>ve </em><em>taken an oath</em><em> not to eat or drink till they’ve killed him.</em><em> T</em><em>hey’re ready</em><em> now</em><em> </em><em>and </em><em>waiting for your promise.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The tribune let him go, <em>“Don’t tell anybody you </em><em>told</em><em> me about this.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

### centurions, “Get 200 soldiers ready, 75 cavalrymen, and 200 infantrymen to leave for Caesarea at 9:00 tonight. 24Provide mounts to deliver Paul safely to Felix the governor.”


<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He wrote a letter to this effect: <strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>“Claudius</em><em> Lysias to </em><em>most</em><em> excellent Governor Felix.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune, <em>“What are you </em><em>doing</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>This man’s a Roman!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> Jews arrested this man and were </em><em>trying</em><em> to kill him when I came on them with troops and rescued him, </em><em>when I</em><em> discovered he was a Roman citizen.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>To</em><em> learn why they were accusing </em><em>him,</em><em> I </em><em>took</em><em> him down into their Sanhedrin.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> found out they were accusing him about questions in their </em><em>L</em><em>aw, not about anything </em><em>that deserves</em><em> bonds or death.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> was informed about a plot against him </em><em>and sent him to you at once. I ha</em><em>ve instructed his accusers to bring charges against him </em><em>in</em><em> you</em><em>r hearing</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 23:23-30</p>

### Paul Sent to Caesarea


<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He responded, <em>“This citizenship cost me a lot of money.”</em> Paul said,<em> “I was born Roman.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>At once the ones that were going to interrogate him stepped away. The tribune was worried when he found out Paul was a Roman and he’d bound him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 22:22-29</p>

### Paul Before the Sanhedrin


<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The next day he was still wanting to know why the Jews were accusing Paul. The tribune took off Paul’s bonds and commanded the chief priests and full Sanhedrin to meet. He took Paul down and put him in front of them. <strong>23</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin, <em>“Brothers, in good conscience I’ve conducted myself as a citizen toward God up to this day.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ananias the high priest commanded the ones that were standing by him to slap him in the mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>So the soldiers took Paul to Antipatris during the night. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>The next day they left the cavalrymen to go with him the rest of the way while they came back to the barracks. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>When they got to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>After he read it, he asked what province he was from. When he learned he was from Cilicia, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>he said, <em>“I’ll give you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> a hearing when your accusers </em><em>get here</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>He gave orders to keep Paul in Herod’s Praetorium.</span>
