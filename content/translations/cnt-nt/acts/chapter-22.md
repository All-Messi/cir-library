## Acts Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>“Brothers</em><em> and fathers, listen to my defense.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When they heard him speaking Hebrew, they got quieter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Knowing one part was Sadducees and the other was Pharisees, he started shouting, <em>“</em><em>I’m a Pharisee, the son of </em><em>a Pharisee! I’m on trial for having</em><em> h</em><em>ope in the</em><em> resurrection!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The tribune let him go, <em>“Don’t tell anybody you </em><em>told</em><em> me about this.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em><strong>Acts 23:12-22</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He wrote a letter to this effect:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>“Claudius</em><em> Lysias to </em><em>most</em><em> excellent Governor Felix.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> <em>The</em><em> Jews arrested this man and were </em><em>trying</em><em> to kill him when I came on them with troops and rescued him, </em><em>when I</em><em> discovered he was a Roman citizen.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>To</em><em> learn why they were accusing </em><em>him,</em><em> I </em><em>took</em><em> him down into their Sanhedrin.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> found out they were accusing him about questions in their </em><em>L</em><em>aw, not about anything </em><em>that deserves</em><em> bonds or death.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> was informed about a plot against him </em><em>and sent him to you at once. I ha</em><em>ve instructed his accusers to bring charges against him </em><em>in</em><em> you</em><em>r hearing</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Acts 23:23-30</strong> <strong>Paul Sent to Caesarea</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He responded, <em>“This citizenship cost me a lot of money.”</em> Paul said,<em> “I was born Roman.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> At once the ones that were going to interrogate him stepped away. The tribune was worried when he found out Paul was a Roman and he’d bound him.</span>

### Paul Before the Sanhedrin


<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The next day he was still wanting to know why the Jews were accusing Paul. The tribune took off Paul’s bonds and commanded the chief priests and full Sanhedrin to meet. He took Paul down and put him in front of them. <strong>23</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin, <em>“Brothers, in good conscience I’ve conducted myself as a citizen toward God up to this day.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ananias the high priest commanded the ones that were standing by him to slap him in the mouth.</span>
