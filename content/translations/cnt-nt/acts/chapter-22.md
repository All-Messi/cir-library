## Acts Chapter 22

### Paul Recounts His Conversion

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“Brothers</em><em> and fathers, listen to my defense.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When they heard him speaking Hebrew, they got quieter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Paul said, <em>“God</em><em>’s going to </em><em>slap you, you whitewashed wall!</em><em> </em><em>You</em><em> sit judging me by the Law and </em><em>command </em><em>them to slap me in violation of the L</em><em>aw.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Knowing one part was Sadducees and the other was Pharisees, he started shouting, <em>“</em><em>I’m a Pharisee, the son of </em><em>a Pharisee! I’m on trial for having</em><em> h</em><em>ope in the</em><em> resurrection!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“I</em><em> answered, ‘Who are you, </em><em>Sir</em><em>?’</em> <em>	</em><em>	‘I’m Jesus the Nazarene that you’re persecuting.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“The</em><em> ones</em><em> </em><em>that were </em><em>with me saw the light but </em><em>couldn’t make out what he was saying to me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As the conflict grew, the tribune was afraid they’d tear Paul limb from limb. He commanded the troops to rescue him and bring him back into the barracks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> That night the Lord stood by him, <em>“Don’t be afraid.</em><em> </em><em>As you’ve </em><em>spoken</em><em> </em><em>for</em><em> me in Jerusalem, you need to </em><em>speak </em>for me<em> in </em><em>Rome.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 23:6-11</p>

### Jewish Plot to Kill Paul


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The next day, some Jews took a binding oath not to eat or drink till they’d killed Paul. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>More than 40 men instigated that plot. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They came to the chief priests and elders, <em>“We’ve taken a binding oath</em><em> not to taste anything </em><em>till</em><em> we’ve killed Paul.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> </em><em>and</em><em> the Sanhedrin inform the tribune to bring him down as if to </em><em>find out</em><em> more accurately the </em><em>issues</em><em> about him.</em><em> </em><em>Before he gets close, </em><em><u>we’re</u></em><em> prepared to kill him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“He</em><em> said, ‘</em><em>Our ancestors’ God</em><em> </em><em>chose</em><em> you ahead of time to know his will, </em><em>to </em><em>see the Righteous One, and </em><em>to hear him. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou’re</em><em> to </em><em>speak</em><em> for him to all people about what you’ve seen and heard.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> why wait?</em><em> </em><em>Get baptized and wash your sins away, calling on him.’</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 22:12-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“When</em><em> I came back to Jerusalem and was praying in the </em><em>T</em><em>emple, I fell into a trance, </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> saw him </em><em>telling</em><em> me, ‘Get out of Jerusalem </em><em>now</em><em>; they won’t </em><em>accept</em><em> your testimony about me.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The tribune took his hand and withdrew privately, “<em>What do you have to report?”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> <em>“He</em><em> said, ‘Go; I’m sending you </em><em>away</em><em> to the Gentiles.’”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 22:17-21</p>

### Responses to His Address


<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The tribune let him go, <em>“Don’t tell anybody you </em><em>told</em><em> me about this.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 23:12-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He wrote a letter to this effect:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> <em>“Claudius</em><em> Lysias to </em><em>most</em><em> excellent Governor Felix.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> <em>The</em><em> Jews arrested this man and were </em><em>trying</em><em> to kill him when I came on them with troops and rescued him, </em><em>when I</em><em> discovered he was a Roman citizen.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>To</em><em> learn why they were accusing </em><em>him,</em><em> I </em><em>took</em><em> him down into their Sanhedrin.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> found out they were accusing him about questions in their </em><em>L</em><em>aw, not about anything </em><em>that deserves</em><em> bonds or death.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> was informed about a plot against him </em><em>and sent him to you at once. I ha</em><em>ve instructed his accusers to bring charges against him </em><em>in</em><em> you</em><em>r hearing</em><em>.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 23:23-30</p>

### Paul Sent to Caesarea


<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> He responded, <em>“This citizenship cost me a lot of money.”</em> Paul said,<em> “I was born Roman.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> At once the ones that were going to interrogate him stepped away. The tribune was worried when he found out Paul was a Roman and he’d bound him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 22:22-29</p>

### Paul Before the Sanhedrin


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The next day he was still wanting to know why the Jews were accusing Paul. The tribune took off Paul’s bonds and commanded the chief priests and full Sanhedrin to meet. He took Paul down and put him in front of them. <strong>23</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin, <em>“Brothers, in good conscience I’ve conducted myself as a citizen toward God up to this day.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ananias the high priest commanded the ones that were standing by him to slap him in the mouth.</span>
