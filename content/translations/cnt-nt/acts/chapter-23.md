## Acts Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin, "Brothers, in good conscience I've conducted myself as a citizen toward God up to this day." 2Ananias the high priest commanded the ones that were standing by him to slap him in the mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Paul said, "God's going to slap you, you whitewashed wall! You sit judging me by the Law and command them to slap me in violation of the Law."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The ones that were standing there said, "You insult God's high priest?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Paul said, "Brothers, I was not aware that he was a high priest. The scripture does say, 'Don't say bad things about a ruler of your people'" [Ex 22:28].</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 22:30-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Knowing one part was Sadducees and the other was Pharisees, he started shouting, "I'm a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I'm on trial for having hope in the resurrection!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Dissension erupted between the Pharisees and Sadducees. 8Sadducees say there's no resurrection, angel, or spirit; Pharisees profess them all. 9During the uproar, some scribes from the Pharisees' party stood up, protesting violently, "We don't find anything wrong with this man! What if a spirit or angel spoke to him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As the conflict grew, the tribune was afraid they'd tear Paul limb from limb. He commanded the troops to rescue him and bring him back into the barracks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> That night the Lord stood by him, "Don't be afraid. As you've spoken for me in Jerusalem, you need to speak for me in Rome." Jewish Plot to Kill Paul</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The next day, some Jews took a binding oath not to eat or drink till they'd killed Paul. 13More than 40 men instigated that plot. 14They came to the chief priests and elders, "We've taken a binding oath not to taste anything till we've killed Paul. 15Now you and the Sanhedrin inform the tribune to bring him down as if to find out more accurately the issues about him. Before he gets close, we're prepared to kill him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Paul's nephew heard about the ambush, went into the barracks, and let Paul know. 17Paul called a centurion, "Take this young man to the tribune; he has something to tell him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He took him to the tribune, "The prisoner Paul asked me to bring you this young man. He has something to tell you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The tribune took his hand and withdrew privately, "What do you have to report?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> "Some Jews have agreed together to ask you to take Paul down into the Sanhedrin tomorrow as if to ask something more accurately about him. 21Don't let them persuade you. More than 40 of them are lying in ambush. They've taken an oath not to eat or drink till they've killed him. They're ready now and waiting for your promise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The tribune let him go, "Don't tell anybody you told me about this." 23He called 2 centurions, "Get 200 soldiers ready, 75 cavalrymen, and 200 infantrymen to leave for Caesarea at 9:00 tonight. 24Provide mounts to deliver Paul safely to Felix the governor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He wrote a letter to this effect:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> "Claudius Lysias to most excellent Governor Felix.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The Jews arrested this man and were trying to kill him when I came on them with troops and rescued him, when I discovered he was a Roman citizen. 28To learn why they were accusing him, I took him down into their Sanhedrin. 29I found out they were accusing him about questions in their Law, not about anything that deserves bonds or death. 30I was informed about a plot against him and sent him to you at once. I have instructed his accusers to bring charges against him in your hearing." Paul Sent to Caesarea</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> So the soldiers took Paul to Antipatris during the night. 32The next day they left the cavalrymen to go with him the rest of the way while they came back to the barracks. 33When they got to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. 34After he read it, he asked what province he was from. When he learned he was from Cilicia, 35he said, "I'll give yousg a hearing when your accusers get here." He gave orders to keep Paul in Herod's Praetorium. Paul's Accusers Come</span>
