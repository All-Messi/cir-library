## Acts Chapter **28**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When we’d made it safely, we learned the island was Malta. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The locals were especially nice to us and received us all. Because of the rain and cold that had set in, they built a fire. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a snake came out of the wood from the heat and fastened on his hand. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The locals saw it and said to one another, <em>“</em><em>He</em><em> </em><em>must be a murderer that survived the sea</em><em>,</em><em> but Justice didn’t let live.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He shook it loose into the fire and wasn’t harmed. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after a good while not seeing anything unusual, they started saying he was a god.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Around that place were lands that belonged to Publius, the Principal in the island. He welcomed us and entertained us for three days. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>His father lay sick with dysentery and bouts of fever. Paul went in to see him, prayed, laid hands on him, and healed him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>After that, other sick people on the island started coming to be healed. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They greatly honored us; and <em>later,</em> when we set sail, they put on board what we needed.</span>

### Paul’s Arrival in Rome


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>After three months, we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered on the island—it had The Twin Brothers (Dioscuri/Twin Sons of Zeus) as its figurehead. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>We harbored at Syracuse for three days, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>then sailed around to Rhegium. A day later, a south wind came up, and the second day we made it to Puteoli. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We found disciples there, who invited us to stay with them for a week. And so we got to Rome. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>From there disciples heard about us and came to meet us as far as Three Taverns and The Forum of Appius. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took heart. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When we went into Rome, <em>the </em><em>centurion</em> let Paul stay by himself with a soldier guarding him.</span>

### Paul’s Witness in Rome


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Three days later he called together the Jewish leaders, <em>“Brothers, though I ha</em><em>dn’t done anything against the p</em><em>eople or </em><em>the </em><em>customs of the forefathers, the Jews delivered me to the Romans as a prisoner from Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The Romans <em>examined me and were willing to release me because there wasn’t any reason to execute me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> the Jews objected, I had to appeal to Caesar, though I didn’t have anything against my nation.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> asked to speak to you because I’m wearing this chain </em><em>on account</em><em> of </em><em>Israel’s hope</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>They said, <em>“We haven’t received any letters about you from the Jews, and none of the brothers have come to report anything bad about you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> do want to hear what you think, because we know </em><em>that </em><em>people everywhere speak against this sect.”</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 28:17-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>On a day they appointed him, quite a number came to where he roomed. From morning to evening, from the Law of Moses and the Prophets, he talked about God’s kingdom and made efforts to persuade them about Jesus. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>What he said persuaded some, but not others. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When they disagreed with each other, they left at Paul’s one comment, <em>“The Holy Spirit </em><em>described</em><em> your </em><em>ancestors</em><em> </em><em>well in</em><em> Isaiah the prophet,</em> <em>	</em><em> </em><em>	</em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><strong><em>‘Tell</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>this</em></strong><strong><em> people,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>“You certainly hear, but </em></strong><strong><em>don’t </em></strong><strong><em>understand</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	 y</em></strong><strong><em>ou certainly see, but </em></strong><strong><em>don’t perceive</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><strong><em>because</em></strong><strong><em> you’ve become </em></strong><strong><em>insensitive;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	you’re</em></strong><strong><em> hard of hearing, and</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	you’ve </em></strong><strong><em>close</em></strong><strong><em>d</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong><em>r eyes</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>so</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>d</em></strong><strong><em>on’t see or hear</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	understand</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>or change</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>so</em></strong><strong><em> I can</em></strong><strong><em> heal you</em></strong><strong><em>”’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 6:9-10]</strong><strong>.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><em>Understand</em><em>, then, that God has sent this salvation to the Gentiles; </em><em><u>they’</u></em><em>ll listen.”</em> [<strong><sup>29</sup></strong>]<sup>ms</sup></span>

### Paul’s Two-Year Imprisonment in Rome


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>For two whole years Paul stayed in his own rented quarters and received everyone that came to him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He presented God’s kingdom without interference and taught boldly about the Lord Jesus as the Messiah.</span>
