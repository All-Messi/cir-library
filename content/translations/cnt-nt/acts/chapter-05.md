## Acts Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>A man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira also sold a piece of land. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He kept part of the price and took the rest to the apostles. (She was in on it.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Peter said, <em>“</em><em>Ananias, why di</em><em>d Satan prompt you to lie to the Holy Spirit, </em><em>when you kept</em><em> part of the price of the field?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>While</em><em> </em><em>you had it</em><em>, wasn’t </em><em>it yours? When you sold it, didn’t you control it? Why </em><em>decide</em><em> to do this</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>You didn’t </em><em>just </em><em>lie to people, but to God.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Ananias heard that, he collapsed and died. Great respect came on everybody that heard about it. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Some three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Peter asked her, <em>“D</em><em>id you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> sell the field for </em><em>such and such</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Peter said, <em>“Why’d you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> agree to test the Spirit of the Lord?</em><em> </em><em>The ones that buried your husband are at the door, and they’ll carry you out.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>She collapsed right there and died. The young men carried her out to bury her beside her husband. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>People that heard about what happened came to greatly respect the church.</span>

### -11 Miracles Among the People


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>The apostles did many signs and wonders among the people, and they were getting together in Solomon’s Portico. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>People hesitated to join them, but they held them in high regard. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Believers kept coming to the Lord, large numbers of men and women. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>As a result, they were bringing sick people out into the streets and putting them on cots and stretchers so when Peter came, even his shadow might fall on some of them. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Crowds even came from towns around Jerusalem, carrying sick people and people harassed by unclean spirits. They were all healed.</span>

### The Apostles Persecuted


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>The high priest and his associates—Sadducees—were jealous. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They arrested the apostles and put them in public custody. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>During the night an angel of the LORD opened the gates of the jail and let them out, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> in</em><em>to</em><em> the </em><em>T</em><em>emple and speak to the people the message about this life.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They went in about daylight and started teaching. The high priest and his associates convened Israel’s Sanhedrin, the senate, and sent to the jail to bring the apostles. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But the officers didn’t find them. They came back and reported,<strong> </strong><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“We</em><em> found t</em><em>he jail secure</em><em>ly locked and t</em><em>he guards standing at the doors;</em><em> but when we opened it, we didn’t find anybody inside.”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The captain of the Temple and the chief priests were dumbfounded about what this might lead to. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>A fellow came and told them, <em>“They’re </em><em>standing in the </em><em>T</em><em>emple, teaching the people.”</em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The captain went with the officers and brought them without force because they were afraid the people would stone them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 5:17-2</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They took them into the Sanhedrin, and the high priest asked them, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“Didn’t</em><em> we strictly charge you not to teach in this name?</em><em> </em><em>You’ve filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man’s blood on us.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Peter and the apostles said, <em>“We </em><em>have to</em><em> obey God </em><em>instead of</em><em> </em><em>you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>Our</em><em> </em><em>ancestors</em><em>’ God raised up Jesus that you </em><em><u>did</u></em><em> murder</em><em> on a tree.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> exalted him as Leader and Savior to his right hand to </em><em>offer</em><em> repentance and forgiveness to Israel.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> </em><em>speak to that fact</em><em> </em><em>and so</em><em> does the Holy Spirit God </em><em>has</em><em> given</em><em> to </em><em>ones that obey him.”</em> <em>	  </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 5:27-32</p>

### Gamaliel’s Advice


<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They were furious and wanted to execute them. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>But a Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named Gamaliel, a respected teacher of the Law, stood up and told them to put the men out <em>of the council chamber</em> for a while, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>“Israelites</em><em>, be careful what you do to the</em><em>m</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Before</em><em> </em><em>now,</em><em> Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody.</em><em> </em><em>About </em><em>400</em><em> men joined him.</em><em> </em><em>He was </em><em>killed</em><em>, and </em><em>everybody that</em><em> obeyed him scattered and didn’t amount to anything.</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>“After</em><em> that,</em><em> Judas the Galilean rose up during the census, and drew people </em><em>to</em><em> him.</em><em> </em><em>He perished </em><em>too, </em><em>and th</em><em>e ones that </em><em>obeyed him </em><em>scattered</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> I tell you, leave these men alone.</em><em> </em><em>If this effort </em><em>is coming</em><em> from men, it’ll be overthrown.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> it’s from God, you </em><em>won’t </em><em>overthrow them, and </em><em>you can</em><em> be fighting against God.”</em><em> </em> They agreed. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>They called the apostles, beat them, charged them not to speak in Jesus’ name, and released them. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>They left the Sanhedrin, elated over being considered worthy of suffering for The Name. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>Every day in the Temple and from house to house, they continued to preach that Jesus was the Messiah.</span>
