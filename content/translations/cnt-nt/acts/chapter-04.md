## Acts Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the Temple, and the Sadducees confronted them. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They resented them teaching the people and claiming in Jesus the resurrection. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They arrested them and put them in jail till the next day because it was already evening. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Many who heard the message believed; the number of men rose to</span>

### ,000. Acts 4:1-4


<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem with <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Annas the high priest and Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the members the high priest’s family. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They stood Peter and John in the assembly, <em>“By what power or name did </em><em>you</em><em> do this?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and said, <em>“Rulers of the people and elders, </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>if</em><em> you’re examining us today to find out what good deed has cured this crippled man, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>know</em><em> this, you and all the people of Israel:</em><em> </em><em>he stands </em><em>here</em><em> cured by Jesus </em><em>the Messiah</em><em>, the Nazarene you </em><em>crucified</em><em> and God resurrected.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘t</em></strong><strong><em>he stone </em></strong><em>you</em><strong><em> builders rejected</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>that</em></strong><strong><em>’s become </em></strong><strong><em>the cornerstone</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:22]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><em>Salvation</em><em> lies </em><em>only in him</em><em>; no</em><em> one else under heaven </em><em>can save us.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 4:5-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When they saw Peter and John’s boldness and took note that they were unschooled, common men, they were amazed, knowing they’d been with Jesus. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They looked at the man standing with them cured and couldn’t say anything against it. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They told them to go outside the Sanhedrin while they conferred,<sup> </sup> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em> are we going to do with these men</em><em>!</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>It’s obvious to everybody in Jerusalem that they’ve </em><em>done</em><em> a notable sign; we can’t deny that.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>But</em><em>, to keep it</em><em> </em><em>from</em><em> spread</em><em>ing</em><em> </em><em>any </em><em>further among the people, let’s strictly threaten them not to speak to anybody again in this name.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>They called them and commanded them never to teach again in the name of Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But Peter answered, <em>“In front of our God, you decide if it’s right to listen to you </em><em>or</em><em> to him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> have to say what we’ve seen and heard.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>When they’d threatened them some more, they let them go. They couldn’t find anything to punish them for, and the people were praising God for what had happened. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The man they’d healed was</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>After their release, they reported to their people what the chief priests and elders had said. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When they heard it, they said to God together, <em>“Master, </em><em>who made</em><em> earth, sky, </em><em>and </em><em>sea, and everything in them, </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>you</em><em> spoke by the Holy Spirit through our </em><em>ancestor</em><em> David your servant,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘Why did the Gentiles rage,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>    </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and the </em></strong><strong><em>peoples</em></strong><strong><em> plot pointless </em></strong><strong><em>threats</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><strong><em>The</em></strong><strong><em> kings of the earth stood together, and</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	the rulers assembled as one</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>against the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> and his Messiah</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 2:1-2].</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup><em>Truly</em><em> in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate with the </em><em>‘</em><em>Gentiles</em><em>’ and the ‘people’</em><em> of Israel </em><em>‘</em><em>assembled against your Holy Servant Jesus</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>to</em><em> do what you already determined would happen.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em>, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, look at their threats, and </em><em>mak</em><em>e</em><em> us</em><em> </em><em><sup>your servants</sup></em><em> bold to speak your message </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>while</em><em> you heal and </em><em>bring about</em><em> signs and wonders through your Holy Servant Jesus.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>After they’d prayed, the place where they’d gathered shook, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak God’s message boldly.</span>

### :23-31 Having All Things in Common


<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>The great number of believers united in heart and soul. Nobody considered anything his own; they held everything in common. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The apostles were powerfully defending the Lord’s resurrection and experiencing a lot of good will. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Nobody lacked what they needed, because the ones who owned land or houses were selling them <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>and taking the proceeds to the apostles. It was distributed as needed. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Joseph—that the apostles called Barnabas (Encourager), a Levite, a Cypriot—<strong><sup>37</sup></strong>sold a field and gave the apostles the proceeds.<strong>  </strong></span>
