## Acts Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the Temple, and the Sadducees confronted them. 2They resented them teaching the people and claiming in Jesus the resurrection. 3They arrested them and put them in jail till the next day because it was already evening. 4Many who heard the message believed; the number of men rose to about 5,000.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem with 6Annas the high priest and Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the members the high priest's family. 7They stood Peter and John in the assembly, "By what power or name did you do this?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and said, "Rulers of the people and elders, 9if you're examining us today to find out what good deed has cured this crippled man, 10know this, you and all the people of Israel: he stands here cured by Jesus the Messiah, the Nazarene you crucified and God resurrected. 11This is</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Salvation lies only in him; no one else under heaven can save us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When they saw Peter and John's boldness and took note that they were unschooled, common men, they were amazed, knowing they'd been with Jesus. 14They looked at the man standing with them cured and couldn't say anything against it. 15They told them to go outside the Sanhedrin while they conferred, 16"What are we going to do with these men!? It's obvious to everybody in Jerusalem that they've done a notable sign; we can't deny that. 17But, to keep it from spreading any further among the people, let's strictly threaten them not to speak to anybody again in this name."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They called them and commanded them never to teach again in the name of Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But Peter answered, "In front of our God, you decide if it's right to listen to you or to him. 20We have to say what we've seen and heard."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When they'd threatened them some more, they let them go. They couldn't find anything to punish them for, and the people were praising God for what had happened. 22The man they'd healed was over 40 years old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> After their release, they reported to their people what the chief priests and elders had said. 24When they heard it, they said to God together, "Master, who made earth, sky, and sea, and everything in them, 25you spoke by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David your servant,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The kings of the earth stood together, and</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Truly in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate with the 'Gentiles' and the 'people' of Israel 'assembled against your Holy Servant Jesus' 28to do what you already determined would happen. 29Now, LORD, look at their threats, and make us your servants bold to speak your message 30while you heal and bring about signs and wonders through your Holy Servant Jesus."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> After they'd prayed, the place where they'd gathered shook, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak God's message boldly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The great number of believers united in heart and soul. Nobody considered anything his own; they held everything in common. 33The apostles were powerfully defending the Lord's resurrection and experiencing a lot of good will. 34Nobody lacked what they needed, because the ones who owned land or houses were selling them 35and taking the proceeds to the apostles. It was distributed as needed. 36Joseph—that the apostles called Barnabas (Encourager), a Levite, a Cypriot—37sold a field and gave the apostles the proceeds.</span>
