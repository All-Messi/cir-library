## Acts Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul took the route through the higher country, and came down to Ephesus and found some disciples. 2He said, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Paul said, "John baptized to repentance and told the people to trust in the One that would come after him, that is, in Jesus." 5When they heard that, they were baptized into the Lord Jesus. 6When Paul laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in languages and prophesy. 7There were about twelve of those men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, persuading them about God's kingdom. 9When some started resisting and saying negative things about The Way in public, he separated the disciples from them and reasoned every day in the school of Tyrannus. 10That went on for two years, so many Jews and Gentiles in Asia heard the Lord's message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God was doing extraordinary miracles through Paul. 12Even towels and aprons carried from his body made diseases go away and evil spirits come out. 13Some Jewish traveling exorcists tried to name the Lord Jesus over people that had evil spirits, "I adjure you by Jesus that Paul preaches." 14Seven sons of a Jew named Sceva, a chief priest, were doing that. 15But the evil spirit answered, "I know Jesus, I recognize Paul, but who are you?" 16The man with the evil spirit overpowered them all, and they fled from the house naked and injured. 17The Jews and Greeks in Ephesus all heard about it. Everyone became afraid and respected the name of the Lord Jesus. 18Many believers came and confessed things they'd done. 19A large number that practiced witchcraft brought their books together and burned them in public. They calculated their value at 50,000 drachmas. 20That's how powerfully the Lord's message was growing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> After that, Paul decided to go through Macedonia and Greece on the way to Jerusalem. "After I've been there, I need to see Rome too." 22He sent two aides on ahead—Timothy and Erastus, while he stayed in Asia for a while.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> About that time a major disturbance came up about The Way. 24A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing a thriving business to the craftsmen. 25He gathered them and similar tradesmen, "You know our livelihood depends on this craft. 26You also see that in Ephesus and most of Asia this Paul has misled a sizable crowd, saying that handmade gods aren't gods. 27Our business is in danger of losing its reputation, people will discount the Temple of the great goddess Artemis, and she that Asia and the world worship will lose her grandeur."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That infuriated them, and they started shouting, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" 29The city was in turmoil. They rushed into the amphitheater, dragging Gaius and Aristarchus of Macedonia, Paul's companions. 30When he wanted to go into the amphitheater, the disciples wouldn't let him. 31Some Asiarchs that were friendly to him also sent word, urging him not to go into the theater. 32Some were shouting one thing, some another. The mob descended into confusion; most didn't know what the gathering was about. 33Some people supposed Alexander had caused the uproar since the Jews had put him forward. He motioned with his hand to make a defense to the people. 34But when they realized he was a Jew, one outcry erupted from everybody for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> After the secretary of the city quieted the crowd, he said, "Ephesians, who doesn't know that Ephesus is temple keeper for the great Artemis and the image that fell from Zeus? 36Since no one can deny that, you need to come to order and not do something rash. 37You haven't accused these men of committing sacrilege or blaspheming our goddess. 38If Demetrius and associate craftsmen want to file suit against them, the courts are in session and proconsuls are available. They can bring charges against one another. 39If you want anything else, it'll be settled in lawful assembly. 40We're in danger of being charged with rioting over today's affair because there's no reason for it. We won't be able to account for this uproar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> He dismissed the assembly.</span>
