## Acts Chapter 19

### Paul Enters Ephesus

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul took the route through the higher country, and came down to Ephesus and found some disciples. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”</em> They said, <em>“We’ve not even heard if the Holy Spirit has come.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <em>“So</em><em>, what were you baptized into?”</em> <em>“John’s baptism.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Paul said, <em>“John b</em><em>aptized to repentance and</em><em> t</em><em>old</em><em> the people to </em><em>trust</em><em> in the One </em><em>that would come</em><em> after him, that is, in Jesus.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When they heard that, they were baptized into the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When Paul laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in languages and prophesy. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>There were about twelve of those men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, persuading them about God’s kingdom. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When some started resisting and saying negative things about The Way in public, he separated the disciples from them and reasoned every day in the school of Tyrannus. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>That went on for two years, so many Jews and Gentiles in Asia heard the Lord’s message.<strong> </strong><strong>  </strong></span>

### The Sons of Sceva


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God was doing extraordinary miracles through Paul. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Even towels and aprons carried from his body made diseases go away and evil spirits come out. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Some Jewish traveling exorcists tried to name the Lord Jesus over people that had evil spirits, <em>“I adjure you by Jesus that Paul preaches.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Seven sons of a Jew named Sceva, a chief priest, were doing that. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But the evil spirit answered, <em>“I </em><em>know</em><em> Jesus</em><em>,</em><em> I </em><em>recognize</em><em> Paul, but who are you?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The man with the evil spirit overpowered them all, and they fled from the house naked and injured. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The Jews and Greeks in Ephesus all heard about it. Everyone became afraid and respected the name of the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Many believers came and confessed things they’d done. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>A large number that practiced witchcraft brought their books together and burned them in public. They calculated their value at 50,000 drachmas. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>That’s how powerfully the Lord’s message was growing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> After that, Paul decided to go through Macedonia and Greece on the way to Jerusalem<em>.</em><em> </em><em>“After I’ve been there, I need to see Rome too.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He sent two aides on ahead—Timothy and Erastus, while he stayed in Asia for a while.</span>

### The Riot in Ephesus


<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> About that time a major disturbance came up about The Way. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing a thriving business to the craftsmen. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He gathered them and similar tradesmen, <em>“Y</em><em>ou know our livelihood depends on this craft.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> also see that in Ephesus and most of Asia this Paul has misled a </em><em>sizable</em><em> crowd, saying that handmade gods aren’t gods.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>O</em><em>ur</em><em> business </em><em>is in danger of losing</em><em> its reputation, people will discount the </em><em>T</em><em>emple of the great goddess Artemis, and she </em><em>that</em><em> Asia and the world worship will lose her </em><em>grandeur</em><em>.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 19:23-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That infuriated them, and they started shouting, <em>“Great </em>is<em> A</em><em>rtemis</em><em> of the Ephesi</em><em>ans!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>The city was in turmoil. They rushed into the amphitheater, dragging Gaius and Aristarchus of Macedonia, Paul’s companions. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>When he wanted to go into the amphitheater, the disciples wouldn’t let him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Some Asiarchs that were friendly to him also sent word, urging him not to go into the theater. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Some were shouting one thing, some another. The mob descended into confusion; most didn’t know what the gathering was about. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Some people supposed Alexander had caused the uproar since the Jews had put him forward. He motioned with his hand to make a defense to the people. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>But when they realized he was a Jew, one outcry erupted from everybody for about two hours, <em>“Great </em>is <em>Artemis of the Ephesians!</em><em>”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 19:28-34</p>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> After the secretary of the city quieted the crowd, he said, <em> “Ephesians, who doesn’t know that Ephesus is temple keeper for the great Artemis and the image that fell from Zeus?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Since</em><em> no one can deny </em><em>that</em><em>,</em><em> you need to come to order and not do something rash.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> haven’t</em><em> </em><em>accused </em><em>these men </em><em>of committing sacrilege</em><em> or blasphem</em><em>ing </em><em>our goddess.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> Demetrius and </em><em>associate </em><em>craftsmen </em><em>want to file </em><em>suit</em><em> against them</em><em>, </em><em>the </em><em>courts are in sessi</em><em>on and proconsuls are available. T</em><em>hey can bring charges against one another.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you want anything </em><em>else,</em><em> it’ll be settled in lawful assembly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>We’re</em><em> in danger of being </em><em>charged with</em><em> riot</em><em>ing</em><em> over today’s affair </em><em>because there’s no reason for it. We won’t</em><em> be able to account for this uproar.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> He dismissed the assembly.</span>
