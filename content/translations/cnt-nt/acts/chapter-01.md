## Acts Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the earlier volume, most excellent Theophilus, I gave an account of what Jesus did and taught <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>up to when by the Holy Spirit he commissioned the apostles he’d chosen. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>During 40 days after he suffered, he showed himself alive to them in a variety of unmistakable proofs and discussed God’s kingdom. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>While he was eating with them, he told them to wait in Jerusalem for <em>“the Father’s promise </em><em>I told you about</em><em>:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>John</em><em> </em><em>immersed</em><em> in water, but </em><em><u>you’ll</u></em><em> be </em><em>‘immersed’</em><em> in the Holy Spirit </em><em>in </em><em>a few</em><em> days</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Acts 1:1-5</strong><em>	</em> <strong>The Ascension of Jesus</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>While they were with him, they asked, “<em>Lord, is that when you’ll </em><em>restore Israel’s independence?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then he ascended and a cloud took him out of sight. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>While they were staring up at the sky, two men in dazzling clothes stood next to them. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Galileans</em><em>, why stand here staring at the sky</em><em>?</em><em> He’ll come back </em><em>the way you</em><em>’ve</em><em> watched him go.”</em><em>                    </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They went back to Jerusalem from the hill called <em>The Mount </em>of Olives, about six-tenths of a mile from the city. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When they went inside, they got together in the upstairs room: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon Zelotes; and Judas son of James. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They were praying with the women there; with Mary, Jesus’ mother; and with his brothers.</span>

### -14 Choosing Judas’ Replacement


<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>During that time Peter stood up among the brothers. (There was a crowd of about 120 there.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They put forward Matthias and Joseph Barsabbas called Justus. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They prayed,<em> “Lord, you know everybody’s heart. S</em><em>how which </em><em>one </em><em>you’ve chosen </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>to</em><em> receive this apostleship that J</em><em>udas left to go to his own place.” </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They cast lots, and <em>the lot</em> fell on Matthias; he joined the eleven apostles.</span>
