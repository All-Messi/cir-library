## Acts Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the earlier volume, most excellent Theophilus, I gave an account of what Jesus did and taught 2up to when by the Holy Spirit he commissioned the apostles he'd chosen. 3During 40 days after he suffered, he showed himself alive to them in a variety of unmistakable proofs and discussed God's kingdom. 4While he was eating with them, he told them to wait in Jerusalem for "the Father's promise I told you about: 5John immersed in water, but you'll be 'immersed' in the Holy Spirit in a few days."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> While they were with him, they asked, "Lord, is that when you'll restore Israel's independence?" 7"Youpl aren't to know the dates and circumstances the Father has scheduled by his authority. 8You'll receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you'll represent me in Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and all over the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then he ascended and a cloud took him out of sight. 10While they were staring up at the sky, two men in dazzling clothes stood next to them. 11"Galileans, why stand here staring at the sky? He'll come back the way you've watched him go."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They went back to Jerusalem from the hill called The Mount of Olives, about six-tenths of a mile from the city. 13When they went inside, they got together in the upstairs room: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon Zelotes; and Judas son of James. 14They were praying with the women there; with Mary, Jesus' mother; and with his brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> During that time Peter stood up among the brothers. (There was a crowd of about 120 there.) 16"Brothers, it needed to happen what the Holy Spirit predicted through David about Judas, who guided the ones that arrested Jesus. 17He had a part in this ministry. (18He bought a field with the payment for his sin. He swelled up and burst open, and his entrails gushed out. 19Everybody in Jerusalem heard about it, so in their [Aramaic] language they called that field Haceldama, Field of Blood.) 20Scripture says in the Psalms, 21-22So we need to choose a replacement to serve as a witness with us about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, someone that's been with us from the time of John's baptizing to the Lord's ascension."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They put forward Matthias and Joseph Barsabbas called Justus. 24They prayed, "Lord, you know everybody's heart. Show which one you've chosen 25to receive this apostleship that Judas left to go to his own place." 26They cast lots, and the lot fell on Matthias; he joined the eleven apostles.</span>
