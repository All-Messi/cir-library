## Acts Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the earlier volume, most excellent Theophilus, I gave an account of what Jesus did and taught <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>up to when by the Holy Spirit he commissioned the apostles he’d chosen. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>D</span>

### days after he suffered, he showed himself alive to them in a variety of unmistakable proofs and discussed God’s kingdom. 4While he was eating with them, he told them to wait in Jerusalem for “the Father’s promise I told you about: 5John immersed in water, but you’ll be ‘immersed’ in the Holy Spirit in a few days.”	Acts 1:1-5	 The Ascension of Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>While they were with him, they asked, “<em>Lord, is that when you’ll </em><em>restore Israel’s independence?”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“You</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> aren’t to k</em><em>now the dat</em><em>es and </em><em>circumstances the Father has scheduled</em><em> by his authority.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you’ll </em><em>represent </em><em>me in Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and </em><em>all over</em><em> the </em><em>world</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then he ascended and a cloud took him out of sight. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>While they were staring up at the sky, two men in dazzling clothes stood next to them. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Galileans</em><em>, why stand here staring at the sky</em><em>?</em><em> He’ll come back </em><em>the way you</em><em>’ve</em><em> watched him go.”</em><em>                    </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>They went back to Jerusalem from the hill called <em>The Mount </em>of Olives, about six-tenths of a mile from the city. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When they went inside, they got together in the upstairs room: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon Zelotes; and Judas son of James. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They were praying with the women there; with Mary, Jesus’ mother; and with his brothers.</span>

### -14 Choosing Judas’ Replacement


<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>During that time Peter stood up among the brothers. (There was a crowd of</span>

### there.) 16“Brothers, it needed to happen what the Holy Spirit predicted through David about Judas, who guided the ones that arrested Jesus. 17He had a part in this ministry. (18He bought a field with the payment for his sin. He swelled up and burst open, and his entrails gushed out. 19Everybody in Jerusalem heard about it, so in their [Aramaic] language they called that field Haceldama, Field of Blood.) 20Scripture says in the Psalms,  ‘Let his house be deserted  			and nobody live in it’ [Ps 69:25]; and, 			‘Let someone else have his office of oversight’ [Ps 109:8]. 21-22So we need to choose a replacement to serve as a witness with us about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, someone that’s been with us from the time of John’s baptizing to the Lord’s ascension.” 	Acts 1:15-22


<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They put forward Matthias and Joseph Barsabbas called Justus. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They prayed,<em> “Lord, you know everybody’s heart. S</em><em>how which </em><em>one </em><em>you’ve chosen </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>to</em><em> receive this apostleship that J</em><em>udas left to go to his own place.” </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They cast lots, and <em>the lot</em> fell on Matthias; he joined the eleven apostles.</span>
