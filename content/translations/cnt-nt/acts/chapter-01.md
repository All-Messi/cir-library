## Acts Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the earlier volume, most excellent Theophilus, I gave an account of what Jesus did and taught <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>up to when by the Holy Spirit he commissioned the apostles he’d chosen. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>During 40 days after he suffered, he showed himself alive to them in a variety of unmistakable proofs and discussed God’s kingdom. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>While he was eating with them, he told them to wait in Jerusalem for <em>“the Father’s promise </em><em>I told you about</em><em>:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>John</em><em> </em><em>immersed</em><em> in water, but </em><em><u>you’ll</u></em><em> be </em><em>‘immersed’</em><em> in the Holy Spirit </em><em>in </em><em>a few</em><em> days</em><em>.”</span>

### The Ascension of Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> While they were with him, they asked, “<em>Lord, is that when you’ll </em><em>restore Israel’s independence?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>“You</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> aren’t to k</em><em>now the dat</em><em>es and </em><em>circumstances the Father has scheduled</em><em> by his authority.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you’ll </em><em>represent </em><em>me in Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and </em><em>all over</em><em> the </em><em>world</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then he ascended and a cloud took him out of sight. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>While they were staring up at the sky, two men in dazzling clothes stood next to them. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Galileans</em><em>, why stand here staring at the sky</em><em>?</em><em> He’ll come back </em><em>the way you</em><em>’ve</em><em> watched him go.”</em><em>                    </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They went back to Jerusalem from the hill called <em>The Mount </em>of Olives, about six-tenths of a mile from the city. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When they went inside, they got together in the upstairs room: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon Zelotes; and Judas son of James. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They were praying with the women there; with Mary, Jesus’ mother; and with his brothers.</span>

### Choosing Judas’ Replacement


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> During that time Peter stood up among the brothers. (There was a crowd of about 120 there.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“Brothers</em><em>, it </em><em>needed to happen</em><em> what the Holy Spirit predicted through David about Judas, </em><em>who</em><em> guide</em><em>d the ones</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> arrested Jesus.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>H</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>had a part in</em><em> this ministry.</em><em> </em>(<strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He bought a field with the payment for his sin. He swelled up and burst open, and his entrails gushed out. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Everybody in Jerusalem heard about it, so in their <em>[Aramaic] </em>language they called that field Haceldama, Field of Blood.)<em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Scripture</em><em> says </em><em>in the Psalms, </em> 	<strong><em>‘Let his house be deserted </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>and nobody </em></strong><strong><em>live</em></strong><strong><em> in it</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 69:25</strong><strong>]</strong>; <em>and,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘Let some</em></strong><strong><em>one</em></strong><strong><em> else </em></strong><strong><em>hav</em></strong><strong><em>e his </em></strong><strong><em>offic</em></strong><strong><em>e of </em></strong><strong><em>oversight</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 109:8]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They put forward Matthias and Joseph Barsabbas called Justus. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They prayed,<em> “Lord, you know everybody’s heart. S</em><em>how which </em><em>one </em><em>you’ve chosen </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>to</em><em> receive this apostleship that J</em><em>udas left to go to his own place.” </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They cast lots, and <em>the lot</em> fell on Matthias; he joined the eleven apostles.</span>
