## Acts Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At Iconium they went into the Jews' synagogue as usual and spoke so convincingly that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed. 2But the disbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the Christians. 3For a good while, they stayed and kept speaking boldly for the Lord, and he confirmed his message about grace by providing signs and wonders they performed. 4The city was divided, some with the Jews, some with the apostles. 5The Gentiles and Jews instigated an attempt to mistreat them and stone them. 6When the apostles found out, they hurried to Lycaonia to the cities Lystra and Derbe, as well as the surrounding area. 7They were delivering the good news there as well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> At Lystra a man crippled in his feet from birth, had never walked. 9He was listening to Paul speak. Paul looked at him and saw he had faith to be cured. 10He shouted, "Stand up!" He jumped up and started walking.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When the crowd saw what Paul did, they shouted out in Lycaonian, "Gods have come down to us in human form!" 12They started calling Barnabas "Zeus" and Paul "Hermes" because Paul did most of the speaking. 13The priest of Zeus Propolis took bulls decked with wreaths of flowers to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowd. 14When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, shouting, 15"Why are you doing this? We're normal men like you, bringing you good news to turn away from these meaningless things to the living God who made earth, sky, and sea, and everything in them. 16In the past, he let nations go their own ways, 17but left evidence of himself by doing good, giving you rain and crops, filling you with food and happiness."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> With that, he barely stopped the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came and persuaded the crowds to stone Paul. They dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead. 20But with the disciples standing around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he left for Derbe with Barnabas.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When they'd presented the good news in that city and made a significant number of disciples, they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia. 22They were strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith and to enter God's kingdom through many difficulties. 23When they'd appointed elders in every city, they prayed and fasted, and commended them to the Lord they'd trusted in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They passed through Pisidia to Pamphylia. 25After they'd presented the message in Perga, they went down to Attalia 26and sailed back to Antioch of Syria, where they'd been committed to God's grace for the work they'd done. 27When they arrived and assembled the church, they recounted what God had done with them and how he'd opened a door of faith for the Gentiles. 28They stayed there a good while with the disciples.</span>
