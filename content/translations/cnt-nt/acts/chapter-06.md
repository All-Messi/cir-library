## Acts Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time when the number of disciples was multiplying, the Hellenists started grumbling against the Hebrews for overlooking their widows in daily food distribution. 2The Twelve assembled the disciples, "We shouldn't step aside from serving God's message to serving tables. 3So pick out seven men with good reputations, who have the Spirit and wisdom, and we'll appoint them to take care of this. 4We'll continue in prayer and serving the message."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> That pleased the crowd, and they chose Stephen, a man with great faith and the Holy Spirit; Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas; and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch. 6They presented them to the apostles, who prayed and laid hands on them. 7God's message grew, and the number of disciples multiplied tremendously in Jerusalem. A large group of priests obeyed the faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> With grace and power, Stephen was doing great signs among the people. 9Some rose up from The Synagogue of the Freemen, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians, and Asians, trying to argue with him; 10but they couldn't stand up to his wisdom and spirit. 11So they bribed some guys to say, "We heard him blaspheme Moses and God." 12They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; seized him, and took him to the Sanhedrin. 13False witnesses stood up, "He keeps speaking against this Holy Place and the Law. 14We've heard him say Jesus the Nazarene will tear this place down and change the customs Moses delivered." 15Everybody sitting in the Sanhedrin looked at him intently and saw his face like the face of an angel.</span>
