## Acts Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>At that time when the number of disciples was multiplying, the Hellenists started grumbling against the Hebrews for overlooking their widows in daily food distribution. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The Twelve assembled the disciples, <em>“</em><em>We shouldn’t step aside from serving</em><em> </em><em>God’s</em><em> message </em><em>to serving</em><em> tables.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> pick out </em><em>seven</em><em> men with good reputations, </em><em>who have</em><em> the Spirit and wisdom, </em><em>and</em><em> we’ll appoint </em><em>them </em><em>to take care of this.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em><u>We’ll</u></em><em> continue in prayer and </em><em>serving </em><em>the message.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> That pleased the crowd, and they chose Stephen, a man with great faith and the Holy Spirit; Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas; and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They presented them to the apostles, who prayed and laid hands on them. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>God’s message grew, and the number of disciples multiplied tremendously in Jerusalem. A large group of priests obeyed the faith.</span>

### Stephen’s Arrest


<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>With grace and power, Stephen was doing great signs among the people. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Some rose up from The Synagogue of the Freemen, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians, and Asians, trying to argue with him; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>but they couldn’t stand up to his wisdom and spirit. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So they bribed some guys to say, <em>“We heard him blaspheme Moses and God.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; seized him, and took him to the Sanhedrin. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>False witnesses stood up, <em>“He keeps speaking ag</em><em>ainst this Holy P</em><em>lace and the </em><em>L</em><em>aw.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>We’ve</em><em> heard him say Jesus the Nazarene will tear this place down and change the customs Moses delivered.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Everybody sitting in the Sanhedrin looked at him intently and saw his face like the face of an angel. <strong>Acts 6:8-15</strong> <strong>Stephen’s Defense </strong></span>
