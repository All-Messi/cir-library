## Acts Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Festus arrived in the province and after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 2The chief priests and leading men of the Jews filed charges against Paul. 3They were demanding a favor against him—to call him to Jerusalem (laying an ambush along the way). 4Festus answered that he would keep Paul in Caesarea and that he himself was going there soon. 5"Have qualified men come down with me and prosecute him if something's wrong with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Eight or ten days later, he went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the judgment seat and commanded to bring Paul. 7When he arrived, the Jews from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious accusations they couldn't prove.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Paul spoke on his own behalf, "I haven't done anything against the Law of the Jews, the Temple, or Caesar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor, so he asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial in front of me there about these matters?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Paul said, "I'm standing at Caesar's judgment seat, where I should be judged. I've not done anything against the Jews, as you very well know. 11If I'm guilty of something that deserves death, I'm willing to die. But, if there's nothing to these accusations, nobody can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Festus conferred with the council and said, "You've appealed to Caesar; you'll go to Caesar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Several days later, King Herod Agrippa II and Bernice arrived in Caesarea and greeted Festus. 14When they'd spent several days there, Festus presented Paul's case to the king, "Felix left a prisoner behind. 15When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews filed charges against him and asked for his condemnation. 16I told them that Roman law doesn't hand anyone over till the accused meets the accusers and has a chance to defend himself. 17After they assembled here, I didn't lose any time. The next day I sat on the judgment seat and had the man brought in. 18The accusers stood up and started bringing accusations against him that weren't like the crimes I'd supposed. 19They disagreed with him about their religion and about a dead Jesus that Paul claimed was alive. 20Uncertain what to do with the controversy, I asked if he'd go to Jerusalem and stand trial on these things. 21When he appealed to Caesar, I commanded that he be held in custody till I sent him up to Caesar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Agrippa said, "I've been wanting to hear him myself. Tomorrow I will."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and went into the auditorium with the tribunes and prominent men of the city. Festus commanded to bring Paul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Festus said, "King Agrippa and youpl that are here with us, you see this man that the Jews in Jerusalem and here have appealed to me about, shouting that he has to die. 25I didn't find that he'd committed any capital offense. Since he appealed to Caesar, I decided to send him. 26I don't have anything definite to write to my superior; so I've brought him to youpl, especially you, King Agrippa, to have something to write after this investigation. 27It doesn't make sense to send a prisoner without specifying the charges."</span>
