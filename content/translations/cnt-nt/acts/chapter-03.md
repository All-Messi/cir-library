## Acts Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Peter and John were going up into the Temple at 3 o'clock prayer. 2Daily, people had been carrying a man crippled from birth and taking him to the Temple gate called Gate Beautiful to ask for alms from people going into the Temple. 3When he saw Peter and John about to go in, he asked for alms. 4Peter looked at him with John and said, "Look at us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He gave them his full attention, expecting to receive something.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Peter said, "I don't have any money, but I'll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus the Messiah, the Nazarene, get up and walk."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He took his right hand and lifted him up. Instantly his feet and ankles strengthened. 8He jumped up and stood and started walking around. He went into the Temple with them, walking and jumping and praising God. 9The people saw him 10and recognized him as the beggar at Gate Beautiful. They were astounded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> While he kept holding onto Peter and John, the people rushed to them in Solomon's Portico, utterly astonished. 12When Peter saw it, he responded, "Israelites, why are you amazed at him? Why stare at us as if we made him walk by our power or godliness? 13Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob's God—our ancestors' God [Ex 3:6, 15]—has glorified his Son Jesus. He's the One you delivered up to Pilate when he'd decided to release him. 14You rejected the Holy and Just One, and asked Pilate to grant you a murderer. 15You killed the author of life that God has resurrected, the One we're witnesses for. 16He's the One that made this man strong. Faith working through him has made this man you know completely well as you can see. 17"Now brothers, I know you didn't realize what you were doing—your rulers didn't either. 18But that's the way God fulfilled what he announced beforehand by many prophets: that his Messiah would suffer. 19So repent: God will erase your sins. 20Times of renewal will come from the LORD, and he'll send the Messiah Jesus that he appointed for you. 21Heaven needs to receive him till God establishes everything he said through his holy prophets so long ago. 22Moses said, 'From among you the LORD your God will raise up a prophet for you like me. Listen to everything he tells you. 23Every person that doesn't will perish from the people' [Deut 18:15-16].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The prophets from Samuel on have told about our time. 25You're descendants of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your ancestors. He told Abraham,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> God has resurrected his Son Jesus and sent him first to you to 'bless' you when you turn away from your sins."</span>
