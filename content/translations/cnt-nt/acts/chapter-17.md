## Acts Chapter **17**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>They traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia to Thessalonica. A Jewish synagogue was there. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As usual, Paul went in and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He showed from predictions that the Messiah had to suffer and arise from the dead, and that, <em>“</em><em>This </em><em>Jesus I’m presenting to you is the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Some were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas—a good number of God-fearers and prominent women. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Jews got jealous and took some riffraff from the marketplace to form a mob. They set the city in an uproar and assaulted Jason’s house, intending to bring <em>Paul and Silas</em> out to the public assembly. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When they didn’t find them, they dragged Jason and some <em>other </em>converts to the city authorities, shouting, <em>“These </em><em>insurgents</em><em> against the empire elsewhere have come here too.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Jason</em><em> </em><em>has welcomed</em><em> them.</em><em> </em><em>They act contrary to </em><em>Caesar’s</em><em> decrees</em><em>, saying there’</em><em>s another king—Jesus.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>That stirred up the crowd and the authorities, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>who made Jason and the rest post bond, then released them.</span>

### Paul in Berea


<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>That night their converts sent Paul and Silas to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Jews’ synagogue. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>These Jews were more open-minded than the ones in Thessalonica. They welcomed the message and examined the scriptures daily to check these things out. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Many of them believed, together with quite a few prominent Greek men and women.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>When Jews from Thessalonica heard Paul was presenting God’s message in Berea, they went there, too, and upset the crowds. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Right away the converts sent Paul away as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The ones that went with Paul conducted him to Athens and brought back word for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as they could.</span>

### Paul Goes to Athens


<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>While Paul waited for them in Athens, seeing the city full of idols upset him. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He reasoned with the Jews and God-fearers in the synagogues and every day with people in the marketplace. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were bantering with him, <em>“What’s this scavenger trying</em><em> to say?”</em> Others commented, <em>“He seems to </em><em>be </em><em>pr</em><em>esenting</em><em> strange gods” </em>(because he was presenting Jesus and the resurrection).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They escorted him to the Areopagus, <em>“Can we know what this new teaching is you’re talking about?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>You’re</em><em> bringing some strange things to us.</em><em> </em><em>We want to know what they mean.”</em> (<strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Athenians and foreign visitors typically spent their time telling or hearing something new.)</span>

### Paul’s Sermon on the Areopagus


<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Paul stood up in the Areopagus and said, <em>“Athenians, I observe that you’re quite religious in every way.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> I was looking at your objects of worship, I ran across an alta</em><em>r inscribed, ‘</em><em>To the Unknown Go</em><em>d.’ </em><em>What I’m pr</em><em>esent</em><em>ing to you then is what you </em><em>worship without knowing him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> God who made the world and everything</em><em> in it, is </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> of earth and sky;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>so</em><em> </em><em>he d</em><em>oesn’t live in handmade sanctuaries. People don’t serve him as if he needs</em><em> anything; he </em><em><u>gives</u></em><em> everybody life, breath, and everything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> </em><em>made the whole human race </em><em>with one nature </em><em>to live all over the </em><em>world, and</em><em> appointed </em><em>their </em><em>times when</em><em> and boundaries </em><em>where they live.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>People</em><em> a</em><em>re to look for God if by chance they </em><em>grope</em><em> around and find him, though he’s not far from any of us.</em><em>  </em><em>	  </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 17:22-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>e</em><em> live and move and exist</em><em> </em><em>in him, like</em><em> some of your poets have said,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	‘We’re his offspring.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup><em>Since</em><em> we’re God’s offspring, we shouldn’t think </em><em>of </em><em>deity </em><em>a</em><em>s like gold or silver or stone or an image </em><em>made </em><em>from </em><em>human art and</em><em> imagination.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> has overlooked the times of ignorance, but now </em><em>he </em><em>tells people everywhere to repent.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> he has established a time to judge the world </em><em>in regard to</em><em> </em><em>goodness</em><em> as </em><em>measured by</em><em> the man he’s appointed.</em><em> </em><em>He’s </em><em>given assurance to </em><em>everybody by resurrecting him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>When they heard “resurrection,” some made fun of it; others said, <em>“We’ll hear you again about this</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>So Paul left them. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Some <em>listeners</em> joined him and believed. Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and some others.</span>
