## Acts Chapter 11

### Peter Reports to Jerusalem

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The apostles and believers in Judaea heard that Gentiles had accepted God’s message. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When Peter went up to Jerusalem, members of the Circumcision took issue with him, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“You</em><em> went in and ate with uncircumcised men.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Peter explained step by step,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“I</em><em> was in Joppa praying when I saw a vision in a trance, </em><em>something </em><em>like a big sheet </em><em>came down </em><em>from </em><em>the sky</em><em> by </em><em>four</em><em> corners.</em><em> </em><em>It came to me</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> I</em><em> stared into it and saw four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and birds.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> heard a voice, ‘Kill and eat them, Peter.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“I</em><em> said, ‘No, Sir; I’ve never eaten anything unclean.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“T</em><em>he</em><em> voice spoke </em><em>a </em><em>second time out of </em><em>the sky</em><em>, ‘Don’t </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> consider unclean what </em><em><u>God</u></em><em> has cleansed.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> happened three times, and everything went back up into the sky.</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>“Right</em><em> then</em><em>,</em><em> three men from Caesarea stood at the house where </em><em>we were staying</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Spirit told me to go with them without scruples.</em><em> </em><em>These six brothers went along and </em><em>entered</em><em> the man’s house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> told us how he’d seen an angel standing in his house, saying, </em><em>‘Send to Joppa for Simon</em><em> called Peter.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> tell you what will save you and your household.’ </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>“While</em><em> I was speaking,</em><em> the Holy Spirit fell on them like</em><em> on us in the beginning.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> remembered what the Lord </em><em>had </em><em>said, ‘John </em><em>immersed</em><em> in water, but </em><em><u>you’ll</u></em><em> be </em><em>“immersed”</em><em> in the Holy Spirit.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> God gave </em><em><u>them</u></em><em> the same gift he </em><em>gave us when </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> </em><em>trusted in</em><em> the Lord Jesus </em><em>the Messiah (‘</em><em>Christ’</em><em>)</em><em>, who was I to oppose God?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When they heard that, they backed off and praised God, <em>“Then God has also </em><em>offered</em><em> </em><em>Gentiles</em><em> </em><em>repentance to life.”</span>

### The Good News in Antioch


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The ones scattered by the ordeal surrounding Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message just to Jews. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>But some Cypriots and Cyrenians went to Antioch and started presenting the Lord Jesus to Greeks as well. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Lord was with them, and a large number turned to the Lord. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The church in Jerusalem heard about them and sent Barnabas to Antioch. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When he got there and saw <em>the evidence of </em>God’s grace, he was glad and encouraged them with heartfelt purpose to remain with the Lord. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith; and a significant number joined the Lord. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He went to Tarsus to look for Paul. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a year they gathered in the church and taught a sizable crowd. They called the disciples Christians first in Antioch.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> At that time, prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>One, named Agabus, signified by the Spirit that a severe famine would come over the whole <em>Roman </em>empire, which took place in the <em>reign of</em> Claudius. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>The believers, as they could, made up their mind to send relief to the Christians in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They sent it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</span>
