## Acts Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The apostles and believers in Judaea heard that Gentiles had accepted God’s message. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When Peter went up to Jerusalem, members of the Circumcision took issue with him, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“You</em><em> went in and ate with uncircumcised men.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Peter explained step by step,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When they heard that, they backed off and praised God, <em>“Then God has also </em><em>offered</em><em> </em><em>Gentiles</em><em> </em><em>repentance to life.”</em><strong></span>

### The Good News in Antioch


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The ones scattered by the ordeal surrounding Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message just to Jews. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>But some Cypriots and Cyrenians went to Antioch and started presenting the Lord Jesus to Greeks as well. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Lord was with them, and a large number turned to the Lord. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The church in Jerusalem heard about them and sent Barnabas to Antioch. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When he got there and saw <em>the evidence of </em>God’s grace, he was glad and encouraged them with heartfelt purpose to remain with the Lord. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith; and a significant number joined the Lord. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He went to Tarsus to look for Paul. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a year they gathered in the church and taught a sizable crowd. They called the disciples Christians first in Antioch.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> At that time, prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>One, named Agabus, signified by the Spirit that a severe famine would come over the whole <em>Roman </em>empire, which took place in the <em>reign of</em> Claudius. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>The believers, as they could, made up their mind to send relief to the Christians in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They sent it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul. <strong>Acts 11:19-30</strong> <strong>Herod Kills James</strong><strong>, Jails Peter</strong></span>
