## Acts Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The apostles and believers in Judaea heard that Gentiles had accepted God's message. 2When Peter went up to Jerusalem, members of the Circumcision took issue with him, 3"You went in and ate with uncircumcised men."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Peter explained step by step, 5"I was in Joppa praying when I saw a vision in a trance, something like a big sheet came down from the sky by four corners. It came to me, 6and I stared into it and saw four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and birds. 7I heard a voice, 'Kill and eat them, Peter.' 9"The voice spoke a second time out of the sky, 'Don't you consider unclean what God has cleansed.' 10That happened three times, and everything went back up into the sky. 11"Right then, three men from Caesarea stood at the house where we were staying. 12The Spirit told me to go with them without scruples. These six brothers went along and entered the man's house. 13He told us how he'd seen an angel standing in his house, saying, 'Send to Joppa for Simon called Peter. 14He'll tell you what will save you and your household.' 15"While I was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on them like on us in the beginning. 16I remembered what the Lord had said, 'John immersed in water, but you'll be "immersed" in the Holy Spirit.' 17If God gave them the same gift he gave us when we trusted in the Lord Jesus the Messiah ('Christ'), who was I to oppose God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When they heard that, they backed off and praised God, "Then God has also offered Gentiles repentance to life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The ones scattered by the ordeal surrounding Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message just to Jews. 20But some Cypriots and Cyrenians went to Antioch and started presenting the Lord Jesus to Greeks as well. 21The Lord was with them, and a large number turned to the Lord. 22The church in Jerusalem heard about them and sent Barnabas to Antioch. 23When he got there and saw the evidence of God's grace, he was glad and encouraged them with heartfelt purpose to remain with the Lord. 24He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith; and a significant number joined the Lord. 25He went to Tarsus to look for Paul. 26When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a year they gathered in the church and taught a sizable crowd. They called the disciples Christians first in Antioch.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> At that time, prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch. 28One, named Agabus, signified by the Spirit that a severe famine would come over the whole Roman empire, which took place in the reign of Claudius. 29The believers, as they could, made up their mind to send relief to the Christians in Jerusalem. 30They sent it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</span>
