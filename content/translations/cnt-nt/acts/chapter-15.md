## Acts Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Some men came down from Jerusalem and started teaching the believers, "Unless you're circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you can't be saved." 2Paul and Barnabas strongly opposed them. The believers appointed Paul, Barnabas, and some others to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this controversy. 3The church sent them forward through Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting extensively on Gentile conversions and bringing a great deal of excitement to those Christians.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When they got to Jerusalem, the church, apostles, and elders welcomed them; and they recounted what God had done with them. 5But some Pharisees that believed got up to say they needed to circumcise them and charge them to keep the Law of Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The apostles and elders got together to look into the issue. 7After considerable discussion, Peter stood up, "Brothers, you know that some time ago God decided Gentiles would hear the good news from me and believe. 8God knows people's hearts and testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit like he did to us Jews. 9He didn't make any distinction between them and us. He purified their hearts by trust. 10So why test God now by putting a yoke on the disciples' neck that our ancestors and we couldn't bear? 11We believe that the grace of the Lord Jesus has saved us the same way it has them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The assembly remained quiet and listened to Barnabas and Paul explain what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then James responded, 14"Simon has recounted how God first took people out of the Gentiles for himself. 15That fits what the prophets have written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So my judgment is that we stop troubling Gentiles who turn to God, 20but write to them to abstain from defilements with idols, sexual immorality, things strangled, and blood; 21because for generations people have preached Moses in every city and read about him in the synagogues every Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The apostles, elders, and the whole church thought it would be good to choose men to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Silas and Judas called Barsabbas, leaders among the Jewish Christians. 23They wrote, "Apostles and elders, to Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings. 24We've heard that some have gone out from us on their own and upset you with their message. 25We met and considered it good to send select men with our dearly loved Barnabas and Paul, 26who've risked their lives for our Lord Jesus the Messiah. 27So we've sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same thing orally. 28The Holy Spirit and we considered it good not to lay any burden on you but this: 29abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood and things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from those, you'll do well. Goodbye."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The ones they sent went down to Antioch, gathered the crowd, and delivered the letter. 31They were elated over the consolation. 32Judas and Silas, being prophets, confirmed the converts with additional presentation. 33When they'd spent some time, the Christians there let them go back in peace. [34]ms 35Paul and Barnabas stayed, teaching and preaching the Lord's message along with a host of others.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> After a time Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's go back to the towns and cities where we presented the Lord's message and see how the converts are doing." 37Barnabas wanted to take John Mark along, 38but Paul didn't think it was wise to take him because he'd deserted them at Pamphylia instead of going on with them to the work. 39Such a serious disagreement arose that they separated. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus; 40Paul chose Silas and went out, commended to God's grace. 41Paul went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</span>
