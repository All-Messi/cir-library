## Acts Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Some men came down from Jerusalem and started teaching the believers, <em>“Unless you’re circumc</em><em>ised according to</em><em> the custom of Moses, you can’t be saved.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Paul and Barnabas strongly opposed them. The believers appointed Paul, Barnabas, and some others to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this controversy. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The church sent them forward through Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting extensively on Gentile conversions and bringing a great deal of excitement to those Christians.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When they got to Jerusalem, the church, apostles, and elders welcomed them; and they recounted what God had done with them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But some Pharisees that believed got up to say they needed to circumcise them and charge them to keep the Law of Moses.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 15:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The apostles and elders got together to look into the issue. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>After considerable discussion, Peter stood up, <em> “Brothers, you know that </em><em>some time</em><em> ago God </em><em>decided Gentiles w</em><em>ould hear the </em><em>good news</em><em> from me and believe.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> knows </em><em>people’s</em><em> heart</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>and </em><em>testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit like he did to us</em><em> </em>Jews<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> didn’t make any </em><em>distinction between them and us. He purifi</em><em>ed their hearts </em><em>by</em><em> </em><em>trust</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> why test God now by putting a yoke on the </em><em>disciples’ </em><em>neck that our </em><em>ancestors and</em><em> we could</em><em>n’t</em><em> </em><em>bear</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> believe that the grace of the Lord Jesus has saved us the same way it has them.”</em><strong>	 </strong><strong>Acts 15:6-11</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The assembly remained quiet and listened to Barnabas and Paul explain what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then James responded,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em> rest</em></strong><strong><em> of mankind can seek the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	that is, the Gentiles </em></strong><strong><em>who wear my name</em></strong><strong><em>,”</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>says the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> that’s</em></strong><strong><em> doing this</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Amos 9:11-12</strong><strong> mainly < LXX</strong><strong>]</strong><strong><em>, </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>who</em><em> is </em>known from of old.’</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>So</em><em> </em><em>my judgment is that we stop troubling Gentiles who</em><em> turn to God, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> write to them to</em><em> abstain from defilements with</em><em> idols, sexual immorality, things </em><em>strangled, and blood; </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>because</em><em> for generations people have preached Moses in every city and read </em><em>about </em><em>him in </em><em>the </em><em>synagogues every Sabbath.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Acts 15:12-21</strong> <strong>The Conference Answers</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The apostles, elders, and the whole church thought it would be good to choose men to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Silas and Judas called Barsabbas, leaders among the <em>Jewish </em>Christians. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They wrote, <em>“Apostles and </em><em>elders</em><em>, to Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.</em><em> Greetings</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>We’ve</em><em> heard that some have gone out from us on their own and upset you with their message.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> met and considered it good to send select men with our </em><em>dearly </em><em>loved Barnabas and Paul, </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>who’ve</em><em> risked</em><em> their lives for our Lord Jesus </em>the <em>Messiah</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> we’ve sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same thing orally.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Holy Spirit and we considered it good not to</em><em> lay any burden on you but this</em><em>:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>abstain</em><em> from things sacrificed to idols, from blood and things strangled, and from sexual immorality.</em><em> If you keep yourselves from tho</em><em>se, you</em><em>’ll</em><em> do well.</em><em> </em><em>Goodbye.</em><em>”</em><em>	</em><strong> </strong><strong>Acts 15:22-29</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The ones they sent went down to Antioch, gathered the crowd, and delivered the letter. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>They were elated over the consolation. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Judas and Silas, being prophets, confirmed the converts with additional presentation. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>When they’d spent <em>some </em>time, the Christians there let them go back in peace. [<strong><sup>34</sup></strong>]<sup>ms</sup> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Paul and Barnabas stayed, teaching and preaching the Lord’s message along with a host of others.<strong> </strong><strong>    </strong><strong>	    Acts 1</strong><strong>5:30-35</strong> <strong>The Parting of Paul and Barnabas</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> After a time Paul said to Barnabas, <em>“Let’s go back to the </em><em>towns and cities</em><em> where we </em><em>presented</em><em> the </em><em>Lord’s message </em><em>and see how the </em><em>convert</em><em>s are doing.”</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Barnabas wanted to take John Mark along, <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>but Paul didn’t think it was wise to take him because he’d deserted them at Pamphylia instead of going on with them to the work. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Such a serious disagreement arose that they separated. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus; <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Paul chose Silas and went out, commended to God’s grace. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>Paul went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. <strong>Acts 15:36</strong><strong>-41</strong> <strong>Paul Continues with the Second Tour</strong><strong> </strong></span>
