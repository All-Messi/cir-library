## Acts Chapter 21

### Paul Continues to Jerusalem

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When we’d left them, we sailed directly to Cos, the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, boarded it, and set sail. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We came within sight of Cyprus; we passed it on the left, kept sailing to Syria, and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>We looked up the disciples and stayed there a week. They kept telling Paul by the Spirit not to go to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When our time there was over, we started our trip. With their wives and children, they escorted us outside the city. After kneeling on the beach and praying, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>we said goodbye to one another. We got on the ship, and they went back home.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 21:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When we’d finished the voyage from Tyre and to Ptolemais, we greeted the disciples and stayed with them for a day. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The next day we reached Caesarea and went into the house of Philip the evangelist—one of the seven—and stayed with him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He had four virgin daughters that prophesied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> During our several days there, a prophet from Judaea named Agabus came down. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He took Paul’s belt and tied up his own hands and feet, and said, <em>“This is what the Holy Spirit says, ‘The man this belt belongs to, the Jews in Jerusalem </em><em>are going to</em><em> tie up and deliver to Gentiles.’”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When we heard it, we and the locals urged and urged Paul not to go up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He answered, <em>“What are you doing, crying and breaking my heart?</em><em> </em><em>I’m ready to be bound and even to die in Jerusalem for the Lord Jesus.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When we couldn’t change his mind, we quit <em>trying</em>, <em>“The Lord’s will be done.”</em><em>   </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> After those days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>along with some disciples from Caesarea. They took us up to Mnason of Cyprus, a long-time disciple we would stay with.<strong></span>

### Paul Visits James


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The believers in Jerusalem welcomed us warmly. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The next day Paul went in with us to see James, and the elders were there. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>After he’d greeted them, he recounted one thing after another that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The ones that heard it, began to praise God, <em>“You see, how many</em><em> thousands among the </em><em><u>Jews</u></em><em> believe, </em><em>all zealous for the L</em><em>aw.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>People</em><em> have told them that </em><em>you teach the Jews among the </em><em>Gentiles to leave Moses, not </em><em>circumcise their children, or keep the customs.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> what can </em><em>we do</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>They’ll certainly </em><em>find out you’re</em><em> </em><em>here</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>e</em><em> have four men under a vow.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Take</em><em> the</em><em>m and purify yourself with them;</em><em> sponsor them so they’ll shave their heads.</em><em> </em><em>Everybody will know there’s nothing to what </em><em>people have</em><em> told </em><em>them </em><em>about you, but that you </em><em>live orderly and keep the L</em><em>aw.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> to </em><em><u>Gentile</u></em><em> believers, we wrote that they should abstain from meat offered to idols, blood, things strangled, and sexual immorality.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The next day Paul took the men, purified himself with them, went into the Temple, and gave notice that they’d completed <em>their</em> days of purification, till the sacrifice for each one was offered.</span>

### Paul’s Arrest in the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Near the end of the seven days, Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple and stirred up the crowd and attacked him, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Men</em><em> of Jerusalem, help.</em><em> </em><em>This is the man that teaches everybody against the people, the </em><em>L</em><em>aw, and this place.</em><em> </em><em>Now he’s brought Gentiles into the </em><em>T</em><em>emple and profaned this holy place.”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Previously they’d seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and supposed he’d taken him into the Temple. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>The city erupted into an uproar. The people ran together, grabbed Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple. Immediately they shut the doors. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>While they were trying to kill him, a report went up to the tribune of the Roman cohort that Jerusalem was in an uproar. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>At once he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The tribune came and took him and told <em>the soldiers</em> to bind him with two chains. He began asking who he was and what he’d done. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another. He couldn’t find out the truth because of the uproar, so he told <em>the soldiers</em> to take him into the barracks. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>When <em>Paul</em> got on the stairs, the soldiers carried him because of the crowd violence. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>The people were following, yelling, <em>“Away with him</em><em>!</em><em>”</em><em></span>

### Paul Speaks to the Tribune


<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> At the entrance to the barracks, Paul said to the tribune, <em>“</em><em>Can</em><em> I speak to you?”</em> He said, <em>“You know Greek?</em> <strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> you’re not the Egyptian that </em><em>master-minded</em><em> a revolt some time back and led </em><em>the 4,000</em><em> Assassins out into the desert?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Paul said, <em>“I’m a Jew from</em><em> Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a</em><em> prominent </em><em>city.</em><em> Please,</em><em> let me speak to the people.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> With his permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned to the people. After a great hush settled in, he spoke in Hebrew.</span>
