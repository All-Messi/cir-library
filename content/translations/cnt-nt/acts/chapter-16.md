## Acts Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> He arrived at Derbe and Lystra. A disciple was there named Timothy, son of a Greek father and a Jewess who believed. 2The Christians in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. 3Paul wanted him to go with him; so he circumcised him because of the Jews in the region; everybody knew his father was a Greek. 4As they went through the cities, they delivered the decrees to keep that the apostles and elders in Jerusalem had determined. 5So the churches were growing in faith and number every day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They went through Galatia and Phrygia, but the Holy Spirit kept them from presenting the message in Asia. 7They came up to the border of Mysia and tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus didn't let them. 8They went on past Mysia down to Troas. 9During the night Paul had a vision—a Macedonian man standing and urging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." 10When he saw the vision, we planned right away to go to Macedonia because we concluded that God had called us to evangelize them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> XX]. 36"When David had served God's will in his own time, he died, was buried with his ancestors, and decayed. 37But the One God resurrected didn't decay. 38Know, then, that through him we're offering forgiveness of sins—something the Law of Moses couldn't do. 39The Messiah justifies everybody that trusts in him. 40Be careful so what the prophets said won't apply to you, if somebody explained it to you'" [Hab 1:5 LXX].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> We sailed from Troas directly to Samothrace and the next day to Neapolis. 12We traveled from there to Philippi, the main city in that district of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. We spent several days there. 13On the Sabbath we went outside the gate beside the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer. We sat down and talked to the women who gathered. 14A woman named Lydia was listening, from the city of Thyatira, a businesswoman dealing in purple fabrics, a God-fearer. The Lord opened her heart to what Paul was saying. 15When she and her household were baptized, she invited us, "If you consider me faithful to the Lord, stay at my house."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> As we were going to the place of prayer, a servant girl with a spirit of divination met us. Her handlers were profiting from her fortunetelling. 17She dogged Paul and us, crying out, "These men serve God Most High. They're telling you how to be saved." 18She did that for days on end. Paul was really annoyed and turned to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus the Messiah, come out of her." It came out that hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> When her handlers saw their prospect for profit disappear, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them to the magistrates in the marketplace, 20"These fellows are Jews. They're causing trouble in our city, 21promoting customs that aren't legal for us Romans to observe." 22The crowd joined the attack, and the soldiers tore their clothes off and commanded to beat them with rods. 23When they'd laid many blows on them, they put them in jail and charged the jailor to keep them secure. 24So he put them in the inner jail and fastened their feet in stocks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the inmates were listening. 26Suddenly a severe earthquake shook the foundations of the jail. The jail doors came open, and everybody's bonds came loose. 27The jailor woke up, saw the doors of the jail open, and drew his sword to kill himself because he assumed the inmates had escaped. 28But Paul yelled, "Don't harm yourself; we're all here!" 29He asked for a light, rushed in, trembling with fear, and fell down to Paul and Silas. 30He brought them outside and said, "What do I need to do to be saved?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They said, "Trustsg in the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They spoke the Lord's message to him and everybody in his family. 33That hour of the night he washed their wounds, and he and his whole family were baptized right then. 34He took them up to his house, set the table, and rejoiced with his family, having trustedpl in God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> At daylight, the magistrates sent the police to release Paul and Silas.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The jailor conveyed that to Paul, "The magistrates have sent word to release you. Now, have a good day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> But Paul told them, "They beat us in public without a hearing—being Roman citizens—and threw us in jail. Now they send us away secretly? Oh no! They need to lead us out themselves."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> The police reported that to the magistrates. They were afraid when they heard they were Roman citizens. 39They came and appealed to them, brought them out, and asked them to leave the city. 40Paul and Silas left the jail and went to Lydia's house. When they'd met with the church and encouraged them, they left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> As Paul and Barnabas were leaving, the synagogue rulers invited them to deliver that message the next Sabbath. 43After the synagogue dismissed, lots of Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who urged them to continue in God's grace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> The following Sabbath nearly the whole city came to hear the Lord's message. 45When the Jews saw the crowd, they got jealous and contradicted Paul and slandered what he presented. 46Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, "We needed to deliver God's message to you first. Since you're rejecting it and consider yourselves not worthy of eternal life, we're turning to the Gentiles. 47That's what the LORD commanded us,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> When the Gentiles heard that, they praised the Lord's message, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. 49His message spread out through the region. 50But the Jews stirred up devout, respected women and prominent men of the city, and instigated persecution against Paul and Barnabas to force them out of their territory. 51They shook the dust off their feet at them and went to Iconium. 52The disciples were full of joy and the Holy Spirit.</span>
