## Acts Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>He arrived at Derbe and Lystra. A disciple was there named Timothy, son of a Greek father and a Jewess who believed. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The Christians in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Paul wanted him to go with him; so he circumcised him because of the Jews in the region; everybody knew his father was a Greek. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>As they went through the cities, they delivered the decrees to keep that the apostles and elders in Jerusalem had determined. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So the churches were growing in faith and number every day.</span>

### Paul’s Vision About Macedonia


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>They went through Galatia and Phrygia, but the Holy Spirit kept them from presenting the message in Asia. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They came up to the border of Mysia and tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus didn’t let them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They went on past Mysia down to Troas. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>During the night Paul had a vision—a Macedonian man standing and urging him, <em>“Come over to Macedonia and help us.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>When he saw the vision, we planned right away to go to Macedonia because we concluded that God had called us to evangelize them.</span>

### Paul and Silas at Philippi


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>We sailed from Troas directly to Samothrace and the next day to Neapolis. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> traveled </em>from there to Philippi, the main city in that district of Macedonia, <em>and </em>a Roman colony. We spent several days there. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>On the Sabbath we went outside the gate beside the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer. We sat down and talked to the women who gathered. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>A woman named Lydia was listening, from the city of Thyatira, a businesswoman dealing in purple fabrics, a God-fearer. The Lord opened her heart to what Paul was saying. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When she and her household were baptized, she invited us, <em>“If you consider me faithful to the Lord, stay at my house.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 16:11-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>As we were going to the place of prayer, a servant girl with a spirit of divination met us. Her handlers were profiting from her fortunetelling. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>She dogged Paul and us, crying out, <em>“These men serve God Most High.</em><em> </em><em>They</em><em>’re telling </em><em>you </em><em>how to be saved</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>She did that for days on end. Paul was really annoyed and turned to the spirit, <em>“I</em><em>n the name of Jesus </em>the<em> Messiah, </em><em>come out of her.”</em> It came out that hour. <strong>Paul and Silas Beaten and Jailed</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>When her handlers saw their prospect for profit disappear, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them to the magistrates in the marketplace, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“These</em><em> </em><em>fellows are Jews. They’re causing trouble in our city, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>promoting</em><em> </em><em>customs </em><em>that aren’t</em><em> legal for us Romans to ob</em><em>serve</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The crowd joined the attack, and the soldiers tore their clothes off and commanded to beat them with rods. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When they’d laid many blows on them, they put them in jail and charged the jailor to keep them secure. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>So he put them in the inner jail and fastened their feet in stocks.</span>

### The Jailor’s Conversion


<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the inmates were listening. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Suddenly a severe earthquake shook the foundations of the jail. The jail doors came open, and everybody’s bonds came loose. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The jailor woke up, saw the doors of the jail open, and drew his sword to kill himself because he assumed the inmates had escaped. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>But Paul yelled, <em>“Don’t har</em><em>m yourself; we’re all here!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>He asked for a light, rushed in, trembling with fear, and fell down to Paul and Silas. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He brought them outside and said, <em>“What do I need to do to be saved?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>They said, <em>“</em><em>Trust</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> in the Lord Jesus, and you and your </em><em>family</em><em> will be saved.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>They spoke the Lord’s message to him and everybody in his family. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>That hour of the night he washed their wounds, and he and his whole family were baptized right then. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He took them up to his house, set the table, and rejoiced with his family, having trusted<sup>pl</sup> in God.</span>

### Paul Leaves Philippi


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>At daylight, the magistrates sent the police to release Paul and Silas.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>The jailor conveyed that to Paul, <em>“The magistrates have sent word to release you.</em><em> </em><em>Now, </em><em>have a good day</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>But Paul told them, <em>“They beat us in public without a hearing</em><em>—being Roman citizens—and</em><em> threw</em><em> us in jail. N</em><em>ow </em><em>they send us away </em><em>secretly?</em><em> Oh no! They need to</em><em> lead us out themselves.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>The police reported that to the magistrates. They were afraid when they heard they were Roman citizens. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>They came and appealed to them, brought them out, and asked them to leave the city. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>Paul</em><em> and Silas </em>left the jail and went to Lydia’s house. When they’d met with the church and encouraged them, they left.</span>
