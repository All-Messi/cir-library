## Acts Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>A centurion in Caesarea named Cornelius, from the Italian cohort, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>was a devout God-fearer along with his household. He gave considerable charitable gifts to the people and prayed to God constantly. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>In a vision about 3 o’clock, he saw an angel of God coming in and saying,<em> “Cornelius.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He looked at him and was afraid, <em>“Yes, </em><em>Sir</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Your prayers and charitable gifts have come up as a memorial </em><em>to</em><em> God. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Send</em><em> </em>some <em>men to Joppa and summon Simon called Peter.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He’s</em><em> staying with Simon </em><em>a tanner whose house is by </em><em>the sea.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When the angel left, he called two household servants—his personal assistants—and a devout soldier. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He went through everything with them and sent them to Joppa.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 10:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The next day, as they were getting close to the town, Peter went up on the housetop about noon to pray. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He was getting hungry. While they were fixing lunch, he fell into a trance. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He watched the sky open up and something like a big sheet was let down to earth by four corners. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>It held reptiles, birds, and four-footed animals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A voice said, <em>“Kill and eat them, Peter.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The voice spoke again, <em>“Don’t </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> consider unclean what </em><em><u>God</u></em><em> has cleansed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> That happened three times, and the vessel went back up into the sky.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 10:9-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>While Peter was wondering what the vision could possibly mean, Cornelius’ men had asked around for Simon’s house and were standing at the gate. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They called out, asking if Simon called Peter was staying there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>While he kept trying to figure out the vision, the Spirit said, <em>“Three men are looking for you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> down and go with them without scruples.</em><em> </em><em>I’ve sent them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He went down and said, <em>“I’m the one you’re looking for.</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>have you come</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They said, <em>“Cornelius is a centurion, a God-fearer</em><em> with a good reputatio</em><em>n in the Jewish nation. A holy angel</em><em> directed </em><em>him</em><em> to invite you to his house to hear what you have to </em><em>say.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>So he invited them in and put them up for the night. The next day he went with them, and some brothers from Joppa went along.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 10:17-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> On the second day, he came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called his relatives and close friends. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When Peter came in, Cornelius met him and fell down to him in homage. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Peter raised him up, <em>“</em><em>Please s</em><em>tand up; I’m just a man too.”</em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>As they talked, Peter went in and found a large group.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> He told them, <em>“You know a Jew’s not supposed to asso</em><em>ciate at</em><em> home with a foreigner</em><em>, b</em><em>ut God </em><em>has shown</em><em> me not to </em><em>consider</em><em> anybody </em>ceremonially <em>unclean.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> without objecting, I came when </em><em>you </em><em>called.</em><em> </em><em>Why did you send for me?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Cornelius said, <em>“Four days </em><em>ago</em><em> </em><em>about this time</em><em>, I was </em><em>observing</em><em> </em><em>3</em><em> o’clock prayer in my house.</em><em> </em><em>A man stood in front of me in bright </em><em>clothes</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your charitable gifts.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>Send</em><em> to Joppa </em><em>for</em><em> Simon called Peter.</em><em> </em><em>He’s staying with Simon</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> tanner </em><em>next to</em><em> the sea.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>Right</em><em> away I </em><em>sent for</em><em> you.</em><em> Thank you</em><em> for coming.</em><em> </em><em>We’re here in front of </em><em>God to hear what the Lord ha</em><em>s commanded you.”</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 10:24-33</p>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Peter said, <em>“I perceive that God doesn’t </em><em>show favoritism</em><em> </em><em>with</em><em> people.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Bu</em><em>t</em><em>, in every nation he accepts people that </em><em>respect him and live </em><em>right</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> sent the message to the </em><em>people</em><em> of Israel, </em><em>delivering</em><em> good news about peace through Jesus </em><em>the Messiah</em><em>, who is Lord </em><em>of all</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> know what took place all over Judaea, </em><em>beginning in</em><em> Galilee after the baptism </em><em>that </em><em>John preached.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> anointed Jesus the Nazarene with the Holy Spirit and power.</em><em> </em><em>He went around doing good and healing </em><em>people</em><em> the devil</em><em> had</em><em> oppressed, because God was with him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> </em><em>witnessed </em><em>what he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.</em><em> O</em><em>n the third day</em><em> </em><em>God raised up </em><em>t</em><em>he One they killed on a tree </em><em>and</em><em> </em><em>presented him clearly,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>not</em><em> to everybody, but to witnesses </em><em>he’d</em><em> previously </em><em>chosen</em><em>—to us who ate with him after </em><em>his resurrection</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>He </em><em>sent</em><em> us to </em><em>tell</em><em> the people that he’s the One God appointed to judge the living and the dead.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prophets </em><em>show</em><em> that through him everybody who </em><em>trusts</em><em> in him </em><em>has his sins forgiven</em><em>.”</em><strong>	 </strong><strong>Acts 10:34-43</strong> <strong>Gentiles Receive the Spirit</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on the audience. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>The believers from the Circumcision who had come with Peter were surprised that God poured out the Holy Spirit on Gentiles too. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>They heard them speak in languages and praise God. Peter responded, <strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>“Nobody</em><em> can forbid water, can </em><em>they</em><em>, for baptizing these who have received the Holy Spirit like we did?”</em> <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>He commanded to baptize them into Jesus the Messiah. They asked him to stay for several days.</span>
