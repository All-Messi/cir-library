## Acts Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After that, he left Athens for Corinth. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He found a Jew named Aquila, a native from Pontus, who was recently displaced from Italy with his wife Priscilla. Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. <em>Paul</em> went to them. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Since he had the same trade, he stayed with them and worked because they were leatherworkers. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath in an effort to persuade Jews and Greeks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul started devoting himself to the message. He was solemnly telling the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When they opposed and slandered <em>him</em>, he shook <em>the dust from</em> his clothes <em>at them</em>, <em>“Your </em><em>blood’s</em><em> on your own heads;</em><em> I’m innocent.</em><em> </em><em>From now on I’m going to the Gentiles.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>He moved from there to the house of Titius Justus, a God-fearer whose house was next to the synagogue. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Crispus, the synagogue ruler, believed in the Lord along with his household. Many Corinthians heard and believed and were baptized. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>At night the Lord told Paul in a vision, <em>“Don’t be afraid.</em><em> </em><em>Speak out </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>because</em><em> I’m with you</em><em>;</em><em> nobody will harm you.</em><em> </em><em>I have lots of people in this city.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For a year and a half he settled there and taught God’s message.</span>

### Paul Before Gallio


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews as a group rose up against Paul and took him to the judgment seat, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“This</em><em> man is persuading people </em><em>to worship God contrary to </em>our<em> L</em><em>aw.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Paul was about to speak up when Gallio told them, <em>“Jews, i</em><em>f it were some</em><em> crime</em><em> </em><em>or fraud he committed</em><em>, I’d have </em><em>a </em><em>reason to </em><em>hear your case</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> if there are questions about </em><em>words</em><em>, names, and your </em><em>L</em><em>aw, see to it yourselves.</em><em> </em><em>I’m not will</em><em>ing to render judgment on such things</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He made them leave the judgment seat. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The bystanders grabbed Sosthenes, the synagogue ruler, and started beating him in front of the judgment seat. Gallio didn’t concern himself with any of that.</span>

### Paul Returns to Antioch


<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Paul stayed quite a few more days, said goodbye to the converts, and set sail for Syria with Priscilla and Aquila. He cut his hair in Cenchrea to keep a vow. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>They arrived at Ephesus, and Paul left them there while he went into the synagogue and dialogued with the Jews. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Although they asked him to stay longer, he declined, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>“I’ll</em><em> come back, God willing”</em>; and sailed from Ephesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and went down to Antioch. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>After he spent some time there, he left and passed through Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening the disciples.</span>

### Apollos Preaches at Ephesus


<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>A Jew named Apollos, born in Alexandria, an eloquent speaker, arrived at Ephesus. He knew the scripture well. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He’d been orally instructed in the way of the Lord. An enthusiastic man, he was teaching accurately things about Jesus, but he only knew about John’s baptism. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and presented the way of God to him more completely. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>When he wanted to cross over to Greece, the disciples encouraged him and wrote letters to them to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped the ones that believed by <em>God’s</em> grace. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>He powerfully refuted the Jews in public and showed by the scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.</span>
