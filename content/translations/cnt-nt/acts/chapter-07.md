## Acts Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The high priest said, <em>“</em><em>Is that true</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Brothers and fathers, listen.</em><em> Our glorious</em><em> God appeared to Abraham </em><em>our ancestor </em><em>in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><em>He</em></strong><strong><em> said, ‘Leave your land and relatives, a</em></strong><strong><em>nd go to the land I’ll show </em></strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 12:1]</strong><strong>.</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> left Chaldea and settled in Haran.</em><em> </em><em>After his father died, God moved him to where we live now.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> didn’t give him an inheritance in it, not even a place to put his foot, but promised </em><strong><em>‘to giv</em></strong><strong><em>e it to him and his descendants</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 12:7</p>

### ] even though he didn’t have a child yet. 6God said his descendants would live in a foreign land that would enslave them and abuse them for 400 years. 7‘I’ll judge that nation, and afterwards I’ll bring them out, and they’ll serve me here’ [Gen 15:13-14]. 8He gave them the covenant of circumcision, so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, father of the twelve patriarchs. 	Acts 7:1-8 9“The other patriarchs resented Joseph and sold him into Egypt, but God was with him. 10He delivered him from difficult circumstances and gave him grace and wisdom in front of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Pharaoh made him governor over Egypt as well as his own household.


<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The ones that scattered went around presenting the message. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Philip went down to the city of Samaria and presented the Messiah to them. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The crowds paid attention to what he said and to the signs he did. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Unclean spirits came out crying loudly, and he healed paralyzed and lame people. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>A lot of joy came to that city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>A man named Simon had previously practiced sorcery in the city. He amazed the Samaritan nation, claiming to be somebody great. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Least to greatest looked up to him, <em>“This is The P</em><em>ower of God</em><em> Called Great</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They looked up to him because for a long time he had amazed them with sorcery. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When they believed Philip’s preaching about God’s kingdom and about Jesus <em>as </em>the Messiah, men and women were baptized. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Simon himself believed and after his baptism he stayed close to Philip, impressed with <em>his</em> outstanding miraculous signs.</span>

### Peter and John in Samaria


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup><em>A</em><em>n</em><em> </em><em>especially stressful </em><em>famine came over Egypt and Canaan, and our </em><em>ancestors</em><em> couldn’t find food.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Jacob</em><em> heard there was grain in Egypt and sent our fathers first.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> second time Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s </em><em>family</em><em> became acquainted with Pharaoh.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Joseph</em><em> </em><em>called</em><em> his father Jacob and all his relatives—</em><em>75</em><em> people.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Jacob</em><em> went down to Egypt, and he and our </em><em>ancestors</em><em> died there.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> were carried over to Shechem and put in the tomb Abraham </em><em>had </em><em>bought from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</em><em> </em><em>	 </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 7:9-16</p>

### 17“As the time came for God’s promise to Abraham, the people multiplied in Egypt 18until ‘another king arose that didn’t know Joseph’ [Ex 1:7-8]. 19He took advantage of our people and abused our ancestors by making them cast out their babies to die. 							 20“At that time Moses was born, an especially good-looking baby raised for three months in his father’s house. 21When he was exposed, Pharaoh’s daughter picked him up and raised him as her own son. 22He was educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians, capable in word and deed.	Acts 7:17-22 23“When he was 40, it occurred to him to visit his kin, the Israelites. 24When he saw one of them mistreated, he avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. 25He supposed his kin understood that God was going to use him to deliver them, but they didn’t. 26“The next day he showed up as two were fighting and tried to make peace, ‘Men, you’re brothers. Why are you mistreating each other?’  27“The one mistreating his neighbor pushed him away, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us? 28You don’t intend to kill me, do you, like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ [Ex 2:13-14] 29“At this, Moses fled from Egypt and became an exile in Midian, where he fathered two sons.	Acts 7:23-29 30“After 40 years, ‘an angel appeared to him in the flame of a burning bush in the desert’ [Ex 3:2-3] around Mt. Sinai. 31Moses was amazed at the sight. When he came for a closer look, the LORD spoke, 32‘I’m your ancestors’ God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ [Ex 3:6]. Moses began to tremble and didn’t dare to look. 33The LORD said, ‘Take your sandals off; you’re standing on holy ground. 34I’ve certainly seen the abuse of my people in Egypt and have come down to deliver them. Go now; I’m sending you to Egypt”’ [Ex 3:4-10]. 35“The Moses they rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge’ [Ex 2:14], God sent as ruler and deliverer by the angel that appeared to him in the bush. 36He led them out and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, the Red Sea, and in the desert for 40 years. 37That’s the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘From among your people God will raise up a prophet for you like me’ [Deut.18:15]. 38That’s the one who was in the congregation in the desert with the angel that spoke to him on Mt. Sinai and with our ancestors. That’s the one who received life-giving oracles for us. 39That’s the one our forefathers didn’t want to obey, but shoved away, turned in heart back to Egypt, 40and told Aaron, ‘Make us gods to go ahead of us. We don’t know what’s happened to this Moses who brought us out of Egypt’ [Ex 32:1, 23]. 41They made a calf, offered sacrifice to the idol, and celebrated over what they had made with their hands.	 Acts 7:30-41 42“God turned away and gave them up to serve the host of heaven, like scripture says in the Book of the Prophets,  			‘You didn’t just offer me slain victims and sacrifices  				for 40 years in the wilderness, did you, Israel?


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When the apostles in Jerusalem heard the Samaritans had accepted God’s message, they sent Peter and John <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>to go down and pray for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The Spirit hadn’t fallen on any of them; they’d only been baptized into the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The apostles laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When Simon saw that the apostles were giving the Spirit by laying on hands, he offered them money, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“Give</em><em> me that</em><em> authority</em><em>,</em><em> too, so whoever I lay my hands on will receive the Spirit.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Peter told him, <em>“Your silver </em><em>perish</em><em> with you!</em><em> </em><em>You </em><em>thought</em><em> you could buy God’s gift with money!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> don’t have any part in this.</em><em> </em><em>Your motives aren’t right </em><em>in front of</em><em> God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Repent</em><em> of this wickedness and pray that maybe he’ll forgive your motives.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> far as I’</em><em>m concerned, you’re in the bitterness </em><em>that gall has and the addiction that</em><em> sinning brings.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Simon answered, <em>“You</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> pray to the Lord for me so nothing like that happen</em><em>s</em><em> to me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>When they’d given their testimony and presented the Lord’s message, they headed back to Jerusalem. On the way they delivered the good news to many Samaritan villages.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Acts </strong><strong>8:14-25</strong> <strong>Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>An angel of the LORD told Philip, <em>“Go south to the road from Jerusalem down to Gaza, which is open country.”</em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>So</em> he went. An Ethiopian, a eunuch, an official, the treasurer for Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. had come to Jerusalem to worship and <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>was going back in his carriage, reading the prophet Isaiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The Spirit told Philip, <em>“Make contact with that</em><em> carriage.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Philip ran toward it and heard him reading Isaiah, <em>“Do you understand what you’re reading?”</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>“How</em><em> can I unless somebody </em><em>explains it</em><em> me?”</em> He invited Philip to come up and sit with him <em>in the carriage</em>. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>This is the passage he was reading: <strong>“They led him like a sheep to </strong><strong>slaughter;</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	like a lamb </strong><strong>silent</strong><strong> in front of </strong><strong>its</strong><strong> shearers,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	he didn’t open his mouth.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><strong>In</strong><strong> </strong>his <strong>humble condition </strong><strong>he received no justice</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	Who </strong><strong>can speak of</strong><strong> his </strong><strong>descendants?</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>his life has been taken from the earth?” </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 53:7-8 LXX]</strong><strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 8:26-33</p>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The eunuch asked, <em>“Who’s the prophet talking about, himself or somebody else?”</em> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Philip started at that scripture and presented to him the good news about Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>As they rode along, they came to some water, the eunuch said, <em>“Here’s some water; </em><em>why can’t I be </em><em>baptized?”</em> <sup>[</sup><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><sup>]</sup><sup>ms</sup><sup> </sup><strong><sup>38</sup></strong>He stopped the carriage, and they both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the LORD caught Philip away, and the eunuch never saw him again. He went on his way happy. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Philip showed up in Azotus. As he traveled, he delivered the good news to towns all along the way to Caesarea.</span>

### Saul’s Conversion


<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><strong><em>You</em></strong><strong><em> carried the tabernacle of </em></strong><strong><em><u>Moloch</u></em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	 and the star of </em></strong><strong><em><u>Rephan</u></em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	images you made </em></strong><em>to worship</em><strong><em>.</em></strong> <strong><em>I’ll carry you away beyond </em></strong><em>Babylon</em><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</span>
<p class="section-ref">Amos 5:25-27</p>

### ].	Acts 7:42-43 44“Our ancestors had the tabernacle as a testimony to them in the desert. The One that spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the design he’d seen. 45That’s what our ancestors brought in with Joshua when they took over the nations God forced out till David’s time. 46David found favor with God and asked to build a house for him. 47Solomon did build a house for God, 48but the Most High doesn’t live in handmade houses. The prophet says, 			49‘“The sky’s my throne; 				the earth’s my footstool. 			What kind of house are you going to build me,” the LORD says? 				“Where will I rest?


<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><strong><em>Haven’t</em></strong><strong><em> I made all this?”’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 66:1-2]</strong> <strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>You</em><em> </em><em>stiff</em><em>-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Sp</em><em>irit just like your ancestors did! </em><strong><sup>52</sup></strong><em>Which</em><em> prophet didn’t they</em><em> persecute?</em><em> </em><em>They killed th</em><em>e ones</em><em> </em><em>that </em><em>predicted the coming of the Righteous One </em><em>that </em><em>you’ve betrayed and murdered, </em><strong><sup>53</sup></strong><em>you</em><em> </em><em>that received the L</em><em>aw ordained </em><em>by angels and haven’t kept it!</em><em>”</em><strong>	Acts </strong><strong>7:44</strong><strong>-53</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They were enraged and gritted their teeth at him. <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>Filled with the Holy Spirit, he looked intently into heaven and saw God’s glory and Jesus standing to his right. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>He said, <em>“I see heaven </em><em>opened and the Son of M</em><em>an standing on the right side of God.”</em> <strong>Stephen Martyred</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup>They shouted out and covered their ears and rushed at him together. <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>They threw him out of the city and started stoning him. The witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man called Saul. <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>As they stoned Stephen, he called out, <em>“Lord</em><em> Jesus, receive my spirit!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>He knelt down and shouted out, <em>“Lord, don’</em><em>t hold this sin against them!</em><em>”</em> Then he died. <strong>8</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>Saul was approving of his death.               	<strong>Acts </strong><strong>7:54-8:1a</strong> <strong>Paul Leads </strong><strong>a General</strong><strong> Persecution</strong> Severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem. Disciples scattered all over Judaea and Samaria—except for the apostles. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Devout men buried Stephen and mourned him greatly. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Saul continued to destroy the church, entering every house, dragging men and women to jail.	       <strong>Acts </strong><strong>8</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>1b-3</strong> <strong>Philip Preaches to Samaritans</strong></span>
