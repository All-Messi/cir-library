## Acts Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the church at Antioch, there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas; Simeon called Niger; Lucius the Cyrenian; Manaen, brought up with Herod the tetraarch; and Saul. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, <em>“Set Barnabas and Saul apart to the work I’ve called them</em><em> for</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They fasted and prayed, laid hands on them, and sent them off.</span>

### Paul and Barnabas in Cyprus


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>So sent by the Holy Spirit, and they went down to Seleucia and sailed to Cyprus. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>At Salamis they delivered God’s message in the synagogues of the Jews, with Mark as their assistant. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When they’d gone the length of the island, they came upon a sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet named Barjesus. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He was with the proconsul Sergius Paullus, an intelligent man, who called for Barnabas and Saul, and wanted to hear God’s message. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Elymas (“Sorcerer”) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>But Saul, or Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked him in the eye <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and said, <em>“Deceitful,</em><em> </em><em>unscrupulousness</em><em> son of the devil, enemy of </em><em>goodness</em><em>, you continually pervert the upright ways of God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em>, </em><em>his hand is on you. Y</em><em>ou’ll be so blind for a </em><em>while</em><em> you can’t see the sun.</em><em>” </em>Immediately darkness fell on him, and he went around trying to find someone to lead him by the hand. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When the proconsul saw what happened, he believed, astonished at the Lord’s teaching.</span>

### Paul and Barnabas in Antioch of Pisidia


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The ones that were with Paul sailed from Paphos to Perga in Pamphylia. John left and went back to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>From Perga, they arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent to them, <em>“Brothers, if you have </em><em>something</em><em> encourag</em><em>ing to say to the people</em><em>, </em><em>go ahead</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Paul stood up and motioned with his hand, <em>“Israelites and God-fearers, </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>our</em><em> God chose our </em><em>ancestors</em><em> and raised </em><em>them </em><em>up while they </em><em>were living</em><em> as foreigners in Egypt.</em><em> </em><em>Afterwards he brought them out of there in stupendous fashion</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>put </em><em>up with them</em><em> </em><em>for</em><em> 40 years </em><em>in the desert.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> Canaan h</em><em>e destroyed </em><em>7</em><em> nations and gave the</em><em>ir</em><em> land to </em>his people<em> as an inheritance</em><em>—</em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>a process that covered <em></span>

### 0 years. After that, he gave them judges till Samuel the prophet. 21When they asked for a king, he gave them Saul son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin for 40 years.  22He removed him and raised up David to be king, ‘I’ve found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who’ll do my will’ [1 Sam 13:14; Ps 89:20]. 23As he’d promised, God raised up from David’s descendants a savior, Jesus. 24Ahead of him John prepared for his coming by presenting to Israel a baptism of repentance. 25As John was carrying out his role, he said, ‘What do you suppose I am? I’m not the One, but after me One is coming whose sandals I’m not worthy to unfasten.’	Acts 13:13-25 26“Brothers, members of Abraham’s nation and God-fearers among you, God has sent you the message about this salvation. 27Those living in Jerusalem and their rulers didn’t recognize him and, by condemning him, fulfilled the prophets they read every Sabbath. 28Although they didn’t find any capital offence, they petitioned Pilate to crucify him. 29When they’d fulfilled everything scripture said about him, they took him down from the tree and put him in a tomb. 30But God resurrected him. 31For many days, he appeared to the ones that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. 32We’re bringing you the good news that the promise God made to our ancestors 33he’s fulfilled to us by resurrecting Jesus. Scripture says in Psalm 2, 		‘You’re my Son; 		I’ve inaugurated you today’ [Ps 2:7].

### 36“When David had served God’s will in his own time, he died, was buried with his ancestors, and decayed. 37But the One God resurrected didn’t decay. 38Know, then, that through him we’re offering forgiveness of sins—something the Law of Moses couldn’t do. 39The Messiah justifies everybody that trusts in him. 40Be careful so what the prophets said won’t apply to you, 		41‘Look, you despisers; 			be amazed and perish. 		I’ll do something in your day you wouldn’t believe  			if somebody explained it to you’” [Hab 1:5 LXX]. 	Acts 13:36-41 Paul Asked to Preach Again


<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As Paul and Barnabas were leaving, the synagogue rulers invited them to deliver that message the next Sabbath. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>After the synagogue dismissed, lots of Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who urged them to continue in God’s grace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The following Sabbath nearly the whole city came to hear the Lord’s message. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>When the Jews saw the crowd, they got jealous and contradicted Paul and slandered <em>what he presented</em>. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, <em>“We needed to </em><em>deliver</em><em> </em><em>God’s message</em><em> to you first.</em><em> Since you’re rejecting</em><em> it </em><em>and consider yourselves </em><em>not </em><em>worthy</em><em> of eternal life, we’re turning to the Gentiles.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>That’s</em><em> what the </em>LORD<em> commanded us,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘I’</em></strong><strong><em>ve</em></strong><strong><em> ma</em></strong><strong><em>d</em></strong><strong><em>e you a light </em></strong><strong><em>for</em></strong><strong><em> the Gentiles</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>so</em></strong><strong><em> you</em></strong><strong><em> can save </em></strong><strong><em>the whole </em></strong><strong><em>world</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>”</em> <strong>[Is</strong><strong> 49:6]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>When the Gentiles heard that, they praised the Lord’s message, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>His message spread out through the region. <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>But the Jews stirred up devout, respected women and prominent men of the city, and instigated persecution against Paul and Barnabas to force them out of their territory. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>They shook the dust off their feet at them and went to Iconium. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>The disciples were full of joy and the Holy Spirit.</span>
