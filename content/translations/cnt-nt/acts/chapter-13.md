## Acts Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the church at Antioch, there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas; Simeon called Niger; Lucius the Cyrenian; Manaen, brought up with Herod the tetraarch; and Saul. 2As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Set Barnabas and Saul apart to the work I've called them for." 3They fasted and prayed, laid hands on them, and sent them off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> So sent by the Holy Spirit, and they went down to Seleucia and sailed to Cyprus. 5At Salamis they delivered God's message in the synagogues of the Jews, with Mark as their assistant. 6When they'd gone the length of the island, they came upon a sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet named Barjesus. 7He was with the proconsul Sergius Paullus, an intelligent man, who called for Barnabas and Saul, and wanted to hear God's message. 8Elymas ("Sorcerer") opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But Saul, or Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked him in the eye 10and said, "Deceitful, unscrupulousness son of the devil, enemy of goodness, you continually pervert the upright ways of God. 11Now, his hand is on you. You'll be so blind for a while you can't see the sun." Immediately darkness fell on him, and he went around trying to find someone to lead him by the hand. 12When the proconsul saw what happened, he believed, astonished at the Lord's teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The ones that were with Paul sailed from Paphos to Perga in Pamphylia. John left and went back to Jerusalem. 14From Perga, they arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down. 15After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent to them, "Brothers, if you have something encouraging to say to the people, go ahead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Paul stood up and motioned with his hand, "Israelites and God-fearers, 17our God chose our ancestors and raised them up while they were living as foreigners in Egypt. Afterwards he brought them out of there in stupendous fashion 18and put up with them for 40 years in the desert. 19In Canaan he destroyed 7 nations and gave their land to his people as an inheritance—20a process that covered about 450 years. After that, he gave them judges till Samuel the prophet. 21When they asked for a king, he gave them Saul son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin for 40 years.  22He removed him and raised up David to be king, 'I've found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who'll do my will' [1 Sam 13:14; Ps 89:20]. 23As he'd promised, God raised up from David's descendants a savior, Jesus. 24Ahead of him John prepared for his coming by presenting to Israel a baptism of repentance. 25As John was carrying out his role, he said, 'What do you suppose I am? I'm not the One, but after me One is coming whose sandals I'm not worthy to unfasten.' 26"Brothers, members of Abraham's nation and God-fearers among you, God has sent you the message about this salvation. 27Those living in Jerusalem and their rulers didn't recognize him and, by condemning him, fulfilled the prophets they read every Sabbath. 28Although they didn't find any capital offence, they petitioned Pilate to crucify him. 29When they'd fulfilled everything scripture said about him, they took him down from the tree and put him in a tomb. 30But God resurrected him. 31For many days, he appeared to the ones that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. 32We're bringing you the good news that the promise God made to our ancestors 33he's fulfilled to us by resurrecting Jesus. Scripture says in Psalm 2,</span>
