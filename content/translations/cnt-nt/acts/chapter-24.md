## Acts Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Five days later, the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an orator, Tertullus. They brought charges to the governor against Paul. 2After Felix called for Paul, Tertullus began accusing him to the governor, "We've experienced considerable peace because of you, and your foresight has led to reforms for this nation. 3With gratitude we welcome them, most excellent Felix, in every way and everywhere. 4But not to detain you further, kindly grant us a brief hearing. 5We've found this man a troublemaker, who stirs up Jews all over the empire, the ringleader of a sect, the Nazarenes. 6He even tried to desecrate the Temple, and we arrested him. [7]ms 8You can question him yourself and find out the things we're accusing him of."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The Jews joined in the attack, claiming those things were so.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When the governor nodded to him, Paul spoke: "I know that for many years you've judged this nation, so I'm glad to make my own defense about these claims. 11You can learn that not more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 12They didn't find me debating or attacking anybody in the Temple, in the synagogues, or in the city. 13They can't prove to you any of these accusations. 14I do admit that according to The Way, which they're calling a 'sect,' I serve our ancestors' God, and believe everything written in the Law and the Prophets. 15In God I have a hope these men themselves share, that the just and unjust will resurrect.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I always do my best to have a clear conscience toward God and other people. 17After some years I was bringing offerings and charitable gifts to my nation. 18In that connection they found me in the Temple, not with a crowd or making a disturbance. 19Some Jews from Asia—they should be here to raise accusation if they have anything against me. 20Or, let these men specify what they found wrong with me when I stood in the Sanhedrin—21other than I shouted, 'I'm being judged today about the resurrection from the dead!'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Because he knew more accurately about The Way, Felix put them off, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I'll decide your case." 23He ordered the centurion to keep him in custody but give him some freedom and let his friends help him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> After some time, Felix with Drusilla his wife, a Jewess, sent for Paul and was listening to him about faith in Jesus the Messiah. 25As he talked about right living, self-control, and judgment to come, Felix became uneasy, "Go away for now; I'll call you when I have time." 26Besides, he was hoping Paul would give him a bribe; so he would send for him often and talk to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> After two years, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix. To gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul behind in prison.</span>
