## Acts Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Pentecost came, they were together. 2All of a sudden a roar from the sky like a violent windstorm filled the house where they were sitting. 3Divided tongues like fire sat on each one of them. 4The Holy Spirit filled them, and they started speaking in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Devout Jews from many countries were living in Jerusalem. 6When that roar erupted, the crowd came together bewildered. Each one was surprised to hear them speaking in their own language. 7"Aren't these men Galileans? 8How can we be hearing our native languages? 9Parthians, Medes, Elamites; people living in Mesopotamia, Judaea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; Roman visitors, 11Jews and proselytes; Cretans and Arabians—we're hearing them speak in our own languages about those outstanding things God has done."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They were surprised and asked each other what was happening.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Others joked, "They're drunk on sweet new wine."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Peter, standing with the eleven, spoke up, "Judeans and you that are living in Jerusalem, listen. 15These men aren't drunk like you're trying to make out; it's only 9 o'clock. 16This is what the prophet Joel was referring to,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The sun will go dark, and 22"Israelites, listen. God approved Jesus the Nazarene by miracles, wonders, and signs you know God did by him among you. 23You handed him over to God's predetermined foreknowledge and plan. You condemned him to death and got people to crucify him that weren't under the Law. 24God released him from a painful death and resurrected him because death couldn't hold him. 25David said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> So I'm glad and rejoice;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You've made the way of life known to me; 29"Brothers, let me speak frankly about the patriarch David: he died and was buried, and his grave's still here. 30So, as a prophet, he knew 'God had solemnly sworn that his descendant would sit on his throne' [Ps 132:11]. 31He saw that ahead of time and was referring to the Messiah's resurrection when he said, 'He wouldn't remain in the grave, and his flesh wouldn't decay' [Ps 16:10]. 32God resurrected this Jesus, as we can all vouch for. 33He ascended to God's right hand, received from the Father the Holy Spirit he promised, and poured out what you're seeing and hearing. 34David didn't ascend to heaven; he said himself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> So Israel can know without a doubt that God has made this Jesus you crucified both 'Lord' and Messiah."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Those comments cut his audience to the heart. They said to Peter and the other apostles, "What are we going to do, brothers!?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Peter said, "Repent, and each of you get baptized to Jesus the Messiah for the forgiveness of your sins, and you'll receive the Holy Spirit as a gift. 39The promise applies to you, your descendants, and everybody afar off—as many as the LORD our God calls."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> With a lot of additional presentation, he urged them, "Be saved from this crooked generation." 41The ones that accepted his message were baptized: about 3,000 were added together that day. 42They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to fellowship, breaking bread, and prayer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Reverence came over them everyone, and the apostles worked many wonders and signs. 44The believers were together and shared everything; 45they started selling property and possessions and distributing them according to need. 46They continued together every day in the Temple, breaking bread by families, and receiving food with sincere gladness. 47They kept praising God and being gracious to the people. Every day the LORD was adding together the ones that were being saved.</span>
