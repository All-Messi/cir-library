## 2 Peter Chapter 3

### Reminders About the Future

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This is the second letter I’ve sent you. In both <em>of them</em>,<em> </em>I’m trying to keep your sincere minds alert <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>by reminding you about the message from the holy prophets and about your apostles’ commandments from the Lord Savior. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Get this, first of all: later, mockers will follow their lusts and say, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Where’s</em><em> the promise about his coming?</em><em> </em><em>From the </em><em>time</em><em> our </em><em>ancestors</em><em> </em><em>died</em><em>, everything’s like it</em><em>'s been</em><em> </em><em>since</em><em> creation.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They choose to forget that by God’s word the skies came into existence long ago and the earth consisted of water and emerged from water. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>By God’s word, the flood destroyed that world. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>By that same word, the earth and sky that exist now are destined for fire; <em>they’re being </em>kept for the judgment day and the destruction of ungodly people.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Pet 3:1-7</p>

### Assurance About the Future


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Friends, don’t miss this one point: to the Lord, a day <em>is</em> like 1,000 years, and 1,000 years <em>is</em> like a day. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He’s not slow about <em>keeping</em><em> </em>his promise the way people might think. He’s not being slow; he’s being patient. He doesn’t want anybody to perish; he wants everyone to repent. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The day of the Lord <u>will come</u>—like a thief: the sky will pass away with a loud noise; the elements will burn up; earth and its works will disappear. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Since they’re destined for destruction, how should you live <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>as you anticipate the time when God destroys the sky with fire and melts the elements with heat? <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>According to his promise, we look forward to a new earth and sky where goodness prevails.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Pet 3:8-13</p>

### Living Meantime


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So, as you look forward to that, try hard to be at peace, spotless and blameless, when he finds you. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Consider our Lord’s patience <em>a chance</em><em> </em>to be saved, as our dear brother Paul wrote to you with the wisdom he’s received. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>In all <em>his</em> letters, he talks about those things. Some of them are hard to understand, and unlearned and unsteady people twist them—like <em>they do </em>the other scriptures—to their own destruction. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So, since you know <em>all that </em>ahead of time, make sure not to get deceived by unprincipled people and fall from your steadfastness. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Keep growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Glory to him now and forever.</span>
