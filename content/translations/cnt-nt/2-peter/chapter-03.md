## 2 Peter Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This is the second letter I've sent you. In both of them, I'm trying to keep your sincere minds alert 2by reminding you about the message from the holy prophets and about your apostles' commandments from the Lord Savior. 3Get this, first of all: later, mockers will follow their lusts and say, 4"Where's the promise about his coming? From the time our ancestors died, everything's like it's been since creation." 5They choose to forget that by God's word the skies came into existence long ago and the earth consisted of water and emerged from water. 6By God's word, the flood destroyed that world. 7By that same word, the earth and sky that exist now are destined for fire; they're being kept for the judgment day and the destruction of ungodly people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Friends, don't miss this one point: to the Lord, a day is like 1,000 years, and 1,000 years is like a day. 9He's not slow about keeping his promise the way people might think. He's not being slow; he's being patient. He doesn't want anybody to perish; he wants everyone to repent. 10The day of the Lord will come—like a thief: the sky will pass away with a loud noise; the elements will burn up; earth and its works will disappear. 11Since they're destined for destruction, how should you live 12as you anticipate the time when God destroys the sky with fire and melts the elements with heat? 13According to his promise, we look forward to a new earth and sky where goodness prevails.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So, as you look forward to that, try hard to be at peace, spotless and blameless, when he finds you. 15Consider our Lord's patience a chance to be saved, as our dear brother Paul wrote to you with the wisdom he's received. 16In all his letters, he talks about those things. Some of them are hard to understand, and unlearned and unsteady people twist them—like they do the other scriptures—to their own destruction. 17So, since you know all that ahead of time, make sure not to get deceived by unprincipled people and fall from your steadfastness. 18Keep growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span>
