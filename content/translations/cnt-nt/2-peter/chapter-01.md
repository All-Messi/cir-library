## 2 Peter Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus ChristMessiah, to those who've received a faith that's equally precious to us—faith in the goodness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ. 2Grace and peace many times over because you know God and Jesus our Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> His divine power has given us everything related to life and godliness. He has provided it all by our knowing the One who called us by his own honor and goodness. 4Through that honor and goodness he has provided us great, precious promises so we can partake of the divine character and escape the corruption that's in the world from living by lust. 5So do your best to add to your faith virtue, to your virtue knowledge, 6to knowledge self-control, endurance, 7godliness, brotherly kindness, love. 8If these keep developing in you, they'll make you useful and fruitful as a result of personally knowing our Lord Jesus Christ. 9Those who lack them are nearsighted and blind. They've forgotten that they were cleansed from their old sins. 10So be all the more diligent in confirming your calling and being chosen. As long as you live that way, you won't stumble. 11You'll be making abundant provision for entering the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So I'll keep reminding you even though you know all this and are standing firm in the truth already. 13As long as I'm in this body, I think it's good to keep you alert by reminding you. 14I know I'll be laying aside my tabernacle soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me. 15I'll be diligent so after I'm gone, you can remember what I've said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> We didn't follow clever, made-up myths when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We saw his majesty with our own eyes. 17He received from God the Father honor and glory when the Majestic Glory declared, "This is my dearly loved Son that I delight in." 18We heard that voice from heaven ourselves when we were with him on the holy mountain. 19And so we have verified the prophetic word. You do well then to pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place till the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 20First of all, get this: no prophecy in scripture comes from somebody's own insight into things. 21No prophet ever just decided to make a prophecy. Instead, the Holy Spirit moved them to speak from God.</span>
