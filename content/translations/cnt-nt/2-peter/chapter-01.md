## 2 Peter Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>, to those who’ve received a faith that’s equally precious to us—<em>faith</em> in the goodness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Grace and peace many times over because you know God and Jesus our Lord.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Pet 1:1-2</p>

### God’s Sufficient Provisions


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> His divine power has given us everything related to life and godliness. He has provided it all by our knowing the One who called us by his own honor and goodness. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Through <em>that </em><em>honor</em><em> and goodness</em> he has provided us great, precious promises so we can partake of the divine character and escape the corruption that’s in the world from living by lust. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So do your best to add to your faith virtue, to your virtue knowledge, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>to knowledge self-control, endurance, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>godliness, brotherly kindness, love. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If these keep developing in you, they’ll make you useful and fruitful as a result of personally knowing our Lord Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Those who lack them are nearsighted and blind. They’ve forgotten that they were cleansed from <em>their </em>old sins. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>So be all the more diligent in confirming your calling and being chosen. As long as you live that way, you won’t stumble. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>You’ll be making abundant provision for entering the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So I’ll keep reminding you even though you know all this and are standing firm in the truth already. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>As long as I’m in this body, I think it’s good to keep you alert by reminding you. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I know I’ll be laying aside my tabernacle soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>I’ll be diligent so after I’m gone, you can remember what I’ve said.</span>

### Events, not Myths


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> We didn’t follow clever, made-up myths when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We saw his majesty with our own eyes. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He received from God the Father honor and glory when the Majestic Glory declared, <em>“This is my </em><em>dearly </em><em>loved Son that I delight in.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>We heard that voice from heaven ourselves when we were with him on the holy mountain. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> so </em>we have verified the prophetic word. You do well <em>then </em>to pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place till the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. <sup>20</sup>First of all, get this: no prophecy in scripture comes from somebody’s own insight <em>into things</em>. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>No prophet ever <em>just</em><em> </em>decided to make a prophecy. Instead, the Holy Spirit moved them to speak from God.</span>
