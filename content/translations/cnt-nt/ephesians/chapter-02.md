## Ephesians Chapter 2

### Spiritual Death from Personal Sinning

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You were ‘dead’ because of the sins <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>you once lived in like the rest of the world. <em>It was a way of living</em> that corresponded to the ruler of the power in the air, the spirit that operates in disobedient people. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Among those people at one time we all lived by fleshly drives. We were doing what the flesh and imagination desired. Our character made us objects of God’s anger like everybody else. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But God was so merciful because he loved us so much. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>We ‘died’ by sinning, but he ‘made us alive’ with Christ (by grace he saved us). <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He raised us up with <em>him</em> and seated us with <em>him</em> in high places. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>In the coming ages, what he did will show the tremendous wealth of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>By grace we’re saved people through faith, and that salvation doesn’t come from us; it’s God’s gift; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>so we can’t be proud. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>We’re his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for living the way God designed us ahead of time to live.</span>
