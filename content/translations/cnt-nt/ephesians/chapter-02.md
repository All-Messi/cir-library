## Ephesians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You were 'dead' because of the sins 2you once lived in like the rest of the world. It was a way of living that corresponded to the ruler of the power in the air, the spirit that operates in disobedient people. 3Among those people at one time we all lived by fleshly drives. We were doing what the flesh and imagination desired. Our character made us objects of God's anger like everybody else. 4But God was so merciful because he loved us so much. 5We 'died' by sinning, but he 'made us alive' with Christ (by grace he saved us). 6He raised us up with him and seated us with him in high places. 7In the coming ages, what he did will show the tremendous wealth of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8By grace we're saved people through faith, and that salvation doesn't come from us; it's God's gift; 9so we can't be proud. 10We're his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for living the way God designed us ahead of time to live. 11-12So, you Gentiles in the flesh—called Uncircumcision by the handmade Circumcision in the flesh, remember that you were separated from Christ at that time. You were excluded from the Commonwealth of Israel, without hope, and without God in the world. 13But you that were once afar off have come near through Christ's blood. 14-15Christ is the basis for peace between us. He made both of us into one group and tore down the wall that separated us. In his flesh he abrogated the Law that's made up of regulations. That way, from the two groups he could create in himself one new united mankind and could make peace between us. 16He could reconcile both of us to God in one body through the cross. In himself he killed the hostility. 17He came and offered peace to you that were far away and to us that were close by. 18Through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. 19So you're not strangers and aliens anymore, but fellow citizens and members of God's family. 20You're built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus as the cornerstone. 21In Christ the whole building fits together and grows upward to become a holy sanctuary. 22In him you're growing along with us into a spiritual house for God in the person of the Spirit.</span>
