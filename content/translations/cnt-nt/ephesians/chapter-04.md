## Ephesians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So I, a prisoner in the Lord, urge you to live appropriate to your calling—2with humility and gentleness, with patience toward each other in love. 3Make every effort to maintain spiritual unity* by being bound together with peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> There's one body, one Spirit, one hope you're called to,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Christ has measured out grace to each of you, 8like it says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What does "he ascended" involve but that he had also descended to earth? 10And the One that had descended also ascended above the skies to complete everything. 11He "gave" apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers 12to equip the saints for service and to build up Christ's body. 13That work goes on till we become one in trusting and knowing God's Son and are full-grown as measured by the stature of Christ. 14That's so we won't stay like little kids, tossed back and forth and blown around by every idea that sly people devise to trick us. 15Let's speak the truth in love and grow up in Christ in every respect. 16He's the head that unites the whole body. Every ligament holds it together so each part can contribute properly to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So don't live like Gentiles anymore in their pointless way of thinking 18and darkened understanding. They're strangers to godly living because they're ignorant and hardhearted. 19They've become insensitive and have given themselves over to doing everything indecent, impure, and greedy. 20You didn't learn to live that way from Christ. [21]repeat</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So set aside the former way of living—the old kind of humanity that's ruined by desires that deceive; 23adopt a new mentality. 24Put on the new kind of humanity that's like God in the goodness and holiness that lie in the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> So don't lie; "each of you, speak truthfully with your neighbor" [Zech 8:16], because you're members of one another. 26"If youpl feel angry, don't sin" [Ps 4:4]. Don't letsg the sun set on your anger; 27don't give the devil a foothold. 28If you're stealing, stop it. Instead, work with your hands, doing what's good so you can share with people who need help. 29Take every bad word out of your mouth and replace it with a good word that builds up with graciousness those who hear you. 30Don't grieve God's Holy Spirit that Christ sealed you with to the day of final redemption. 31Get rid of bitterness, wrath, anger, angry shouting, blasphemy, hateful feelings. 32Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, gracious, like God in Christ was gracious to you.</span>
