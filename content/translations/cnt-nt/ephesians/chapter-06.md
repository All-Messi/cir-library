## Ephesians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Children, obey your parents in the Lord; it's the right thing to do. 2-3"Honor your father and mother so you'll live long and well" [Ex 20:12; Deut. 5:16] (the first commandment with a promise attached). 4Dads, don't make your kids resent you. Raise them up in the Lord's instruction and discipline.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Servants, obey your masters with fear and trembling, sincerely as if obeying Christ. 6Don't just try to create impressions to please them; but as Christ's servants, do God's will honestly 7with good intentions. Be serving the Lord, as it were, not people. 8Understand that whatever each of you does, you'll receive it back from the Lord whether you're a servant or free. 9Masters, treat your servants the same way. Give up making threats; you know that their Lord and yours is in heaven, and he doesn't show preferences.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Finally, be strong in the Lord and his great power. 11Put on God's full armor so you can withstand the devil's schemes. 12You're not fighting a physical war, but rulers, authorities, this world's dark forces, spiritual evil in high places. 13So put on God's full armor so you can withstand sinful times, overcome everything, and stand firm. 14So stand firm. Tie truth around your waist. Make goodness your breastplate. 15On your feet, wear the good news about peace. 16Along with everything else, pick up faith as your shield so the devil's flaming arrows will ricochet away from you. 17Take salvation for a helmet and God's word as a spiritual sword. 18Pray in the spirit on every occasion. Stay alert and persist in petitions for the saints. 19Pray that I'll speak boldly the unrevealed message that the good news makes known. 20On behalf of it, I'm an ambassador in chains. Pray that I'll speak boldly for him like I need to.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Tychicus, our dear brother and faithful minister in Christ, will fill you in on my circumstances and how I'm doing. 22I've sent him to do that so he can comfort you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Peace to fellow believers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 24Grace be with everybody that has undying love for him.</span>
