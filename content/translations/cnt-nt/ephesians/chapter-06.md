## Ephesians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Children, obey your parents in the Lord; it’s the right thing to do. <strong><sup>2-</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><em>“Honor</em></strong><strong><em> your father and mother so you’ll live long and well”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 20:12; Deut. 5:16]</strong> (the first commandment with a promise <em>attached</em>). <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Dads, don’t make your kids resent you. Raise them up in the Lord’s instruction and discipline.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Servants, obey your masters with fear and trembling, sincerely as if obeying Christ. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Don’t just try to create impressions to please them; but as Christ’s servants, do God’s will honestly <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>with good intentions. Be serving the Lord, as it were, not people. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Understand that whatever each of you does, you’ll receive it back from the Lord whether you’re a servant or free. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Masters, treat your servants the same way. Give up making threats; you know that their Lord and yours is in heaven, and he doesn’t show preferences.</span>

### The Full Armor of God


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Finally, be strong in the Lord and his great power. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Put on God’s full armor so you can withstand the devil’s schemes. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>You’re not fighting a physical war, but rulers, authorities, this world’s dark forces, spiritual evil in high places. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>So put on God’s full armor so you can withstand sinful times, overcome everything, and stand firm. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So stand firm. Tie truth around your waist. Make goodness your breastplate. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>On your feet, wear the good news about peace. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Along with everything else, pick up faith as <em>your</em> shield so the devil’s flaming arrows will ricochet away from you. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Take salvation for a helmet and God’s word as a spiritual sword. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Pray in the spirit on every occasion. Stay alert and persist in petitions for the saints. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Pray that I’ll speak boldly the unrevealed message that the good news makes known. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>On behalf of it, I’m an ambassador in chains. <em>Pray</em> that I’ll speak boldly for him like I need to.</span>

### Farewells


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Tychicus, our dear brother and faithful minister in Christ, will fill you in on my circumstances and how I’m doing. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>I’ve sent him to do that so he can comfort you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Peace to fellow believers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Grace <em>be</em> with everybody that has undying love for him.</span>
