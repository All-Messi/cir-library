## Ephesians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of ChristMessiah Jesus by God's will, to the saints [in Ephesus]ms and faithful in Christ Jesus. 2Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He's blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in high places. 4Before he founded the world, he chose us in Christ to be holy and blameless in his presence in love. 5It pleased him to destine us ahead of time to be his children through Jesus Christ. 6So we praise the glorious grace he freely extended to us in the Beloved. 7He redeemed us by his blood, and that forgiveness demonstrates the rich grace 8he lavished on us by providing us wisdom and insight. 9He let us know his previously unrevealed will that, in his good pleasure, he intended for Christ 10to oversee when the time came. He chose to sum up everything in Christ in heaven and on earth. 11In him we've become an inheritance for the One who accomplishes everything according to his own counsel and purpose. 12As a result of what he's done, we praise his glory—we who have already placed our hope in Christ. 13You've heard the truth as well—the good news about salvation—and put your trust in him; and he has sealed you with the Holy Spirit he promised. 14The Spirit is God's pledge to give us our full inheritance when he redeems his people—to the praise of his glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I've heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for the saints. 16So I keep including you in my prayers and being grateful for you. 17I pray that the God of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ will give you wisdom and revelation by knowing him. 18That means enlightening you to recognize what the hope of his calling is, to realize how rich his inheritance among the saints is, 19and to understand what the unlimited greatness of his power is toward us who believe. 20God brought about that hope, inheritance, and power by raising Christ from the dead and seating him on his own right hand in high places. 21Now he's far above all rule, authority, power, dominion, and everybody else in this age and the next. 22-23God put him in charge of everything as head of his body the church, the embodiment of the One that fills everything.</span>
