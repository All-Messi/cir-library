## Ephesians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> Jesus by God’s will, to the saints [in Ephesus]<sup>ms</sup> and faithful in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eph 1:1-2</p>

### The Blessings of Redemption


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Blessed <em>be</em> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He’s blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in high places. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Before he founded the world, he chose us in Christ to be holy and blameless in his presence in love. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>It pleased him to destine us ahead of time to be his children through Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So we praise the glorious grace he freely extended to us in the Beloved. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He redeemed us by his blood, and that forgiveness demonstrates the rich grace <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>he lavished on us by providing us wisdom and insight. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He let us know his previously unrevealed will that, in his good pleasure, he intended for Christ <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>to oversee when the time came. He chose to sum up everything in Christ in heaven and on earth. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>In him we’ve become an inheritance for the One who accomplishes everything according to his own counsel and purpose. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>As a result of what he’s done, we praise his glory—we who have already placed our hope in Christ. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>You’ve heard the truth as well—the good news about salvation—and put your trust in him; and he has sealed you with the Holy Spirit he promised. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Spirit</em> is <em>God’s</em> pledge to <em>give us </em>our <em>full </em>inheritance when he redeems his <em>people</em>—to the praise of his glory.</span>

### Prayer for the Ephesians


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I’ve heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for the saints. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So I keep including you in my prayers and being grateful for you. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> pray </em>that the God of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ will give you wisdom and revelation by knowing him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>That means enlightening you to recognize what the hope of his calling is, <em>to realize </em>how rich his inheritance among the saints is, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and <em>to understand </em>what the unlimited greatness of his power is toward us who believe. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God brought about that <em>hope, inheritance, and power</em> by raising Christ from the dead and seating him on his own right hand in high places. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Now</em> he’s far above all rule, authority, power, dominion, and everybody else in this age and the next. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>23</sup></strong>God put him in charge of everything as head of his body the church, the embodiment of the One that fills everything.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong></span>
