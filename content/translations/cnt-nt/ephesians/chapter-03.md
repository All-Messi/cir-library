## Ephesians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> That’s why I’m Christ’s prisoner for you Gentiles. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You’ve heard about the stewardship of grace God gave me for you. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He revealed to me his previously unrevealed message, like I noted briefly before. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When you read it, you can understand my insight into that message about Christ. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>In other generations God hadn’t made it known to anybody, but now the Spirit has revealed it to his holy apostles and prophets. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>This is the message: Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, fellow partakers of the promise available in Christ Jesus through the good news. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I became a minister of that message by the grace God gave me in keeping with his powerful working. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>To me, the least of the saints, he gave this grace to present to Gentiles Christ’s amazing riches <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and to bring to light the message that in ages past God kept to himself, who created everything. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The church can make known to rulers and authorities in high places the many forms of God’s wisdom. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>That comes from the eternal purpose he brought about in Christ our Lord. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>In him we have confident bold access because we trust him. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>So don’t get discouraged over my difficulties on your behalf. They honor you.</span>

### Another Prayer for the Ephesians


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So I kneel to the Father; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>from him every people group in heaven and on earth has identity. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>I pray that, in keeping with his glorious riches, he’ll greatly increase your inner strength by his Spirit. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> pray </em>that Christ will live in your heart by faith, rooted and grounded in love. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> pray </em>that you’ll be able to understand with all the saints the length and breadth, height and depth of Christ’s love, which is greater than knowledge. <em>I pray</em> that you’ll fully experience everything God provides you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now to him who can do far more than we think or ask in keeping with the power that’s at work in us—<strong><sup>21</sup></strong>glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations. Amen.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong></span>
