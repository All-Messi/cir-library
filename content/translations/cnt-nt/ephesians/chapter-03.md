## Ephesians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> That's why I'm Christ's prisoner for you Gentiles. 2You've heard about the stewardship of grace God gave me for you. 3He revealed to me his previously unrevealed message, like I noted briefly before. 4When you read it, you can understand my insight into that message about Christ. 5In other generations God hadn't made it known to anybody, but now the Spirit has revealed it to his holy apostles and prophets. 6This is the message: Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, fellow partakers of the promise available in Christ Jesus through the good news. 7I became a minister of that message by the grace God gave me in keeping with his powerful working. 8To me, the least of the saints, he gave this grace to present to Gentiles Christ's amazing riches 9and to bring to light the message that in ages past God kept to himself, who created everything. 10The church can make known to rulers and authorities in high places the many forms of God's wisdom. 11That comes from the eternal purpose he brought about in Christ our Lord. 12In him we have confident bold access because we trust him. 13So don't get discouraged over my difficulties on your behalf. They honor you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So I kneel to the Father; 15from him every people group in heaven and on earth has identity. 16I pray that, in keeping with his glorious riches, he'll greatly increase your inner strength by his Spirit. 17I pray that Christ will live in your heart by faith, rooted and grounded in love. 18-19I pray that you'll be able to understand with all the saints the length and breadth, height and depth of Christ's love, which is greater than knowledge. I pray that you'll fully experience everything God provides you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now to him who can do far more than we think or ask in keeping with the power that's at work in us—21glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations. Amen.</span>
