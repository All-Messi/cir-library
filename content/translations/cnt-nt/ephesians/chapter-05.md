## Ephesians Chapter 5

### Imitating God

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So imitate God like children he loves. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Live in love like Christ loved you and gave himself for you <em>as an</em> offering, a sacrifice to God for a sweet fragrance. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Don’t let immorality, impurity, or greed even be mentioned among you, as is appropriate for saints. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Don’t allow any indecency or foolish, vulgar talk among you; express gratitude instead. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Know for certain that no immoral, impure, or covetous person—covetousness amounts to idolatry—will inherit anything in the kingdom of Christ and God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eph 5:1-5</p>

### Resisting Human Influence


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Don’t let anybody deceive you with meaningless words. Because of things like that, God measures out his anger on disobedient people. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So don’t take part in their disobedience. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>At one time you were in the dark; now you’re in the light that comes from the Lord. (Light produces goodness, uprightness, and truth.)<sup> </sup>Live like enlightened children <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and demonstrate what pleases the Lord.<strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Don’t take part in deeds done in darkness; they don’t produce anything; expose them for what they are. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>It’s disgraceful even to talk about what some people do secretly. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Everything exposed by light becomes visible; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>light makes everything visible. So he says, <em>“Wake up </em><em>up</em><em>, sleeper</em><em>”</em> <strong>(Rom 13:11</strong><strong>)</strong><em>;</em> <em>	“</em><em>arise from the dead</em><em>” </em><strong>(Is 26:19)</strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <em>	and Christ will give you light</em><em>”</em> <strong>(Is 60:1).</strong><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eph 5:6-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So be careful to live like wise people. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Make the most of <em>every</em> opportunity because this is a sinful time. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Don’t be foolish; know what the Lord’s will is. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Don’t get drunk on wine in reckless living; be filled with the Spirit. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Speak to each other in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make melody in your hearts to the Lord. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, always thank the Father for everything.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eph 5:15-20</p>

### Family Virtues


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Defer to one another out of respect for Christ. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Wives defer to your husbands the way <em>you do </em>to the Lord, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>because a husband is responsible above the wife like Christ is responsible above the church and Savior of the body. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>As the church defers to Christ, wives defer to husbands in the over-all order <em>of the home</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Husbands, love your wives the way Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He did it to sanctify the church and cleanse it by washing <em>it</em> with water and the word. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He did it so he could present the church to himself without stain or wrinkle or anything like that—so it would be holy and blameless. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Husbands, love your wives like your own bodies. Loving your wife amounts to loving yourself. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Nobody neglects his own body; he feeds it and takes care of it. Christ does that with the church <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>because we’re parts of his body: <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><strong><em>“That’s</em></strong><strong><em> why</em></strong><strong><em> a man is to leave his </em></strong><strong><em>parents</em></strong><strong><em> and unite with his wife, and </em></strong><strong><em>they’ll</em></strong><strong><em> be</em></strong><strong><em>come</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>one</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen </strong><strong>2:24]</strong>.<strong> </strong><strong><sup>32</sup></strong>That’s a profound matter, but the main thing I’m talking about is Christ and the church. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>But, each one of you needs to love his wife like he loves himself, and wives need to respect their husbands.<strong> </strong><strong>Eph 5:21-33</strong></span>
