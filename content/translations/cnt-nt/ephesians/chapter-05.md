## Ephesians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So imitate God like children he loves. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Live in love like Christ loved you and gave himself for you <em>as an</em> offering, a sacrifice to God for a sweet fragrance. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Don’t let immorality, impurity, or greed even be mentioned among you, as is appropriate for saints. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Don’t allow any indecency or foolish, vulgar talk among you; express gratitude instead. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Know for certain that no immoral, impure, or covetous person—covetousness amounts to idolatry—will inherit anything in the kingdom of Christ and God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eph 5:1-5</p>

### Resisting Human Influence


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Servants, obey your masters with fear and trembling, sincerely as if obeying Christ. 6Don't just try to create impressions to please them; but as Christ's servants, do God's will honestly 7with good intentions. Be serving the Lord, as it were, not people. 8Understand that whatever each of you does, you'll receive it back from the Lord whether you're a servant or free. 9Masters, treat your servants the same way. Give up making threats; you know that their Lord and yours is in heaven, and he doesn't show preferences. The Full Armor of God</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Don’t let anybody deceive you with meaningless words. Because of things like that, God measures out his anger on disobedient people. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So don’t take part in their disobedience. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>At one time you were in the dark; now you’re in the light that comes from the Lord. (Light produces goodness, uprightness, and truth.)<sup> </sup>Live like enlightened children <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and demonstrate what pleases the Lord.<strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Finally, be strong in the Lord and his great power. 11Put on God's full armor so you can withstand the devil's schemes. 12You're not fighting a physical war, but rulers, authorities, this world's dark forces, spiritual evil in high places. 13So put on God's full armor so you can withstand sinful times, overcome everything, and stand firm. 14So stand firm. Tie truth around your waist. Make goodness your breastplate. 15On your feet, wear the good news about peace. 16Along with everything else, pick up faith as your shield so the devil's flaming arrows will ricochet away from you. 17Take salvation for a helmet and God's word as a spiritual sword. 18Pray in the spirit on every occasion. Stay alert and persist in petitions for the saints. 19Pray that I'll speak boldly the unrevealed message that the good news makes known. 20On behalf of it, I'm an ambassador in chains. Pray that I'll speak boldly for him like I need to. Farewells</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Don’t take part in deeds done in darkness; they don’t produce anything; expose them for what they are. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>It’s disgraceful even to talk about what some people do secretly. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Everything exposed by light becomes visible; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>light makes everything visible. So he says, <em>“Wake up </em><em>up</em><em>, sleeper</em><em>”</em> <strong>(Rom 13:11</strong><strong>)</strong><em>;</em> <em>	“</em><em>arise from the dead</em><em>” </em><strong>(Is 26:19)</strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <em>	and Christ will give you light</em><em>”</em> <strong>(Is 60:1).</strong><em> </em><em>	  </em><strong>Eph 5:6-14</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So be careful to live like wise people. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Make the most of <em>every</em> opportunity because this is a sinful time. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Don’t be foolish; know what the Lord’s will is. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Don’t get drunk on wine in reckless living; be filled with the Spirit. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Speak to each other in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make melody in your hearts to the Lord. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, always thank the Father for everything.</span>

### Family Virtues


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> the first commandment with a promise attached). 4Dads, don't make your kids resent you. Raise them up in the Lord's instruction and discipline.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Defer to one another out of respect for Christ. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Wives defer to your husbands the way <em>you do </em>to the Lord, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>because a husband is responsible above the wife like Christ is responsible above the church and Savior of the body. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>As the church defers to Christ, wives defer to husbands in the over-all order <em>of the home</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Peace to fellow believers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 24Grace be with everybody that has undying love for him. Translator: Virgil Warren    								      christir.org</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Husbands, love your wives the way Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He did it to sanctify the church and cleanse it by washing <em>it</em> with water and the word. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He did it so he could present the church to himself without stain or wrinkle or anything like that—so it would be holy and blameless. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Husbands, love your wives like your own bodies. Loving your wife amounts to loving yourself. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Nobody neglects his own body; he feeds it and takes care of it. Christ does that with the church <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>because we’re parts of his body: <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><strong><em>“That’s</em></strong><strong><em> why</em></strong><strong><em> a man is to leave his </em></strong><strong><em>parents</em></strong><strong><em> and unite with his wife, and </em></strong><strong><em>they’ll</em></strong><strong><em> be</em></strong><strong><em>come</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>one</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen </strong><strong>2:24]</strong>.<strong> </strong><strong><sup>32</sup></strong>That’s a profound matter, but the main thing I’m talking about is Christ and the church. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>But, each one of you needs to love his wife like he loves himself, and wives need to respect their husbands.<strong> </strong><strong>Eph 5:21-33</strong></span>
