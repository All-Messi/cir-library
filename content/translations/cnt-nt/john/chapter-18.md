## John Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>When Jesus finished, he went out with his disciples </strong><strong>past</strong><strong> the valley Kidron</strong><strong> to an o</strong><strong>rchard.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>Judas knew about the place, because Jesus often went there with his disciples.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>Judas had</strong><strong> received a cohort as well as officers of the chief priests </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd Pharisees, and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>Jesus knew what</strong><strong> was coming on him, and went out to them, </strong><strong><em>“Who are you looking for?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><em>“Jesus the Nazarene.”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“I’m Jesus.”</em></strong> <strong>	Judas was standing with them.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>Whe</strong><strong>n</strong><strong> he said, </strong><strong><em>“I’m Jesus,”</em></strong><strong> they shrank back and fell to the ground.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>He asked them again, </strong><strong><em>“Who are you looking for?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“Jesus the Nazarene.”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><em>“I told you, I’m Jesus.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>If you’re looking for me, let these go”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>(in keeping with what he had said, </strong><strong><em>“I haven’t lost any you gave me.”</em></strong><strong>)</strong><strong>.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><strong>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>His name was Malchus.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“Put you sword</em></strong><strong><em> back</em></strong><strong><em> in its sheath.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Am I not going to drink the cup the Father gave me to drink?”</em></strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>Then the cohort, the tribune, and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus, bound him, </strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><strong>and led him to Annas first, because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><strong>He was the Caiaphas who counseled the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>Simon Peter and another disciple</strong><strong> followed Jesus.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>That disciple</strong><strong> was acquainted with the high priest</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and went in with</strong><strong> Jesus to the court</strong><strong>yard.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><strong>Peter stood outside at the gate.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The </strong><strong>o</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> disciple</strong><strong> went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>The maid, the gatekeeper, said to Peter, </strong><strong><em>“Aren’t you one of this man’s disciples?”</em></strong> <strong>	He said, </strong><strong><em>“No.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>Servants and officers were standing there.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>They had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Peter was standing with them, warming himself.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>        </strong><strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 18:1-18</p>

### The Trial Before Annas


<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><strong>Jesus answered, </strong><strong><em>“I spoke to the world openly and taught constantly in the synagogue and the temple, where all the Jews gather.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>I haven’t done anything secretly.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><strong><em>Why are you asking me?</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Ask the ones that heard what I said.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>They know what I said.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>O</strong><strong>ne of the officers standing by slapped him, </strong><strong><em>“Do you answer the high priest that way?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><strong><em>“If I said something wrong, tell me what it was.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>If I said something good, why are you hitting me?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>        </strong><strong> </strong><strong>          </strong></span>

### 19-24 Peter’s Final Denials


<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>They said to him, </strong><strong><em>“You</em></strong><strong><em>’re not</em></strong><strong><em> one of his disciples too, are you?”</em></strong> <strong>	 </strong><strong><em>“No.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, said, </strong><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>Didn’t </em></strong><strong><em>I </em></strong><strong><em>see</em></strong><strong><em> you in the orchard with him?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>Again Peter denied it, and a rooster crowed.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>  </strong><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>       </strong></span>

### The Trials Before Pilate


<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>They led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>It was early, and they didn’t go in the Praetorium </strong><strong>themselves.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>They didn’t want to get </strong><strong>defiled and </strong><strong>nkot be </strong><strong>able to eat the Passover.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><strong>So Pilate</strong><strong> came out to them, </strong><strong><em>“What charges are you bringing against this man?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><strong><em>“If he weren’</em></strong><strong><em>t a criminal, we wouldn’</em></strong><strong><em>t have delivered him to you.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>Pilate said, </strong><strong><em>“You take him and judge him by your law.”</em></strong> <strong>	The Jews said, </strong><strong><em>“It’s illegal for us to execute anybody”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><strong>(in fulfillment of Jesus’ statement about how he would die).</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>Pilate went back in t</strong><strong>he Praetorium and called Jesus,</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>“Are you the king of the Jews?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><strong><em>“Are you asking this yourself</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong><strong><em> or have other people prompted you?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>Pilate answered, </strong><strong><em>“I’m not a Jew, am I?</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Your nation and the chief priests delivered you to me.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>What have you done?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>My</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>kingdom</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong><em> is not </em></strong><strong><em>an earthly kingdom</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>If it were, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being delivered to the Jews.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>Pilate said to him, </strong><strong><em>“So you’re a ‘king’ then?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“Yes; I’m a ‘king.’</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>That’s why I was born—the reason I came:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>to testify to the truth.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>Pilate said, </strong><strong><em>“What’</em></strong><strong><em>s truth?</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>When</strong><strong> </strong><strong>he heard</strong><strong> this, he went out to the Jews, </strong><strong><em>“I don’t find him guilty of anything.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><strong><em>You have a custom that I release </em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em> prisoner to you at the Passover.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><strong>They shouted again, </strong><strong><em>“Not him</em></strong><strong><em>!</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Barabbas!</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>(Barabbas was an insurrectionist.)</strong></span>
