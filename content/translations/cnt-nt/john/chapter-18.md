## John Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When Jesus finished, he went out with his disciples past the wadi Kidron to an orchard <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Judas knew about, because Jesus often went there with his disciples. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Judas had received a cohort as well as officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus knew what was coming and went out to meet them, <em>“Who are you looking for?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He asked them again, <em>“Who are you looking for?”</em> <em>“Jesus the Nazarene.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear. His name was Malchus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“Put you</em><em>r</em><em> sword </em><em>back </em><em>in its sheath.</em><em> </em><em>Am I not going to drink the cup the Father gave me to drink?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then the cohort, the tribune, and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They led him to Annas first because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He’s the Caiaphas who counseled the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was acquainted with the high priest and went in with Jesus to the courtyard. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Peter stood outside at the gate. The other disciple went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The gatekeeper, a servant woman, said<sup>p</sup> to Peter, <em>“Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’re not</em><em> one of th</em><em>is</em><em> man’s disciples</em><em>, are you</em><em>?”</em> <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Servants and officers were standing there. They’d built a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was standing with them, warming himself. <strong>Jn 18:10</strong><strong>-18</strong> <strong>The Trial Before Annas</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He answered, <em>“I spoke </em><em>openly </em><em>to the world and taught constantly in syn</em><em>agogue and in the Temple, where</em><em> the Jews </em><em>all </em><em>gather.</em><em> </em><em>I haven’t done anything secretly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Why </em><em>ask</em><em> me?</em><em> </em><em>Ask the ones that heard </em><em>me</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They know what I said.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>One of the officers standing by slapped him, <em>“Do you answer the high priest that way?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	       </strong><strong>Jn 18:19-24</strong> <strong>Peter’s Final Denials</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>While Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself, <em>the </em><em>officers</em> said, <em>“You’re not one of his disciples too, are you?”</em> <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>I saw</em><em> you in the orchard with him</em><em>, didn’t I</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Peter denied it again. Immediately a rooster crowed.</span>

### The Trials Before Pilate


<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They led<sup>p</sup> Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They didn’t go into the Praetorium themselves. They didn’t want to defile themselves and not be able to eat the Passover. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>So Pilate came out to them, <em>“What charges are you bringing against this man?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Pilate said, <em>“You take him and judge him by your </em><em>L</em><em>aw.”</em> <em>“It’s illegal for us to </em><em><u>execute</u></em><em> anybody”</em> (<strong><sup>32</sup></strong>fulfilling Jesus’ statement about how he would die).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Pilate went back into the Praetorium and called Jesus, <em>“Are you the K</em><em>ing of the Jews?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Pilate said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“What’s truth?”</em> When he said that, he went out to the Jews, <em>“</em><em>He’s not</em><em> guilty of anything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>You have a custom that I release </em><em>a</em><em> prisoner to you at Passover.</em><em> Do you want me to release ‘the K</em><em>ing of the Jews’?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> They shouted again, <em>“Not him! Barabbas!</em><em>”</em><em> </em>(an insurgent).	<strong>Jn 1</strong><strong>8:28</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>40</strong></span>
