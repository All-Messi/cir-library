## John Chapter 18

### Agony in the Garden; 	The Arrest; Peter’s First Denial

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jesus finished, he went out with his disciples past the wadi Kidron to an orchard <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Judas knew about, because Jesus often went there with his disciples. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Judas had received a cohort as well as officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus knew what was coming and went out to meet them, <em>“Who are you looking for?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“Jesus the Nazarene.”</em><em> </em> <em>“I’m Jesus.”</em><em> </em>(Judas was standing with them.) <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When he said, <em>“I’m Jesus,”</em> they drew back and fell to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He asked them again, <em>“Who are you looking for?”</em> <em>“Jesus the Nazarene.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“I told you I’m Jesus.</em><em> </em><em>If you’re looking for me, let these go”</em> (<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>like he’d said, <em>“I haven’t lost any you gave me.</em><em>”</em>).<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 18:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear. His name was Malchus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus said, <em>“Put you</em><em>r</em><em> sword </em><em>back </em><em>in its sheath.</em><em> </em><em>Am I not going to drink the cup the Father gave me to drink?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the cohort, the tribune, and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They led him to Annas first because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He’s the Caiaphas who counseled the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was acquainted with the high priest and went in with Jesus to the courtyard. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Peter stood outside at the gate. The other disciple went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The gatekeeper, a servant woman, said<sup>p</sup> to Peter, <em>“Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’re not</em><em> one of th</em><em>is</em><em> man’s disciples</em><em>, are you</em><em>?”</em> <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Servants and officers were standing there. They’d built a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was standing with them, warming himself.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 18:10-18</p>

### The Trial Before Annas


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He answered, <em>“I spoke </em><em>openly </em><em>to the world and taught constantly in syn</em><em>agogue and in the Temple, where</em><em> the Jews </em><em>all </em><em>gather.</em><em> </em><em>I haven’t done anything secretly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Why </em><em>ask</em><em> me?</em><em> </em><em>Ask the ones that heard </em><em>me</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They know what I said.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> One of the officers standing by slapped him, <em>“Do you answer the high priest that way?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> <em>“If I said something wrong, what was</em><em> it? </em><em>If I </em><em>didn’t</em><em>, wh</em><em>at</em><em> are you hitting me</em><em> for</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 18:19-24</p>

### Peter’s Final Denials


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> While Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself, <em>the </em><em>officers</em> said, <em>“You’re not one of his disciples too, are you?”</em> <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>I saw</em><em> you in the orchard with him</em><em>, didn’t I</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Peter denied it again. Immediately a rooster crowed.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 18:25-27</p>

### The Trials Before Pilate


<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They led<sup>p</sup> Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They didn’t go into the Praetorium themselves. They didn’t want to defile themselves and not be able to eat the Passover. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>So Pilate came out to them, <em>“What charges are you bringing against this man?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <em>“If he w</em><em>as</em><em>n’t a criminal, we wouldn’t have delivered him to you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Pilate said, <em>“You take him and judge him by your </em><em>L</em><em>aw.”</em> <em>“It’s illegal for us to </em><em><u>execute</u></em><em> anybody”</em> (<strong><sup>32</sup></strong>fulfilling Jesus’ statement about how he would die).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Pilate went back into the Praetorium and called Jesus, <em>“Are you the K</em><em>ing of the Jews?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> <em>“Are you asking that</em><em> yourself, or have other people prompted you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> <em>“I’m not a Jew, am I?</em><em> </em><em>Your nation and the chief priests delivered you to me.</em><em> </em><em>What have you done?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> <em>“My ‘kingdom’ is not </em><em>an earthly kingdom</em><em>.</em><em> If it was</em><em>, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being delivered to the Jews.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> <em>“So you’re a ‘king’ then?”</em> <em>“Yes,</em><em> I’m a ‘king.’</em><em> </em><em>That’s why</em><em> I was born—why I came into the world—</em><em>t</em><em>o speak about </em><em>truth.</em><em> Everybody that’s committed to truth listens to me.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Pilate said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“What’s truth?”</em> When he said that, he went out to the Jews, <em>“</em><em>He’s not</em><em> guilty of anything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>You have a custom that I release </em><em>a</em><em> prisoner to you at Passover.</em><em> Do you want me to release ‘the K</em><em>ing of the Jews’?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> They shouted again, <em>“Not him! Barabbas!</em><em>”</em><em> </em>(an insurgent).</span>
