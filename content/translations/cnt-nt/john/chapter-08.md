## John Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> esus went to the Mount of Olives. 2Early in the morning he went back to the Temple. The people came, and he sat down and started teaching them. 3The scribes and Pharisees broughtp a woman they'd caught in adultery and stood her in front of everybody, 4"Rabbi, we caught this woman in adultery—in the very act. 5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone a woman like this. What do you say?" 6(They were trying to trap him so they could accuse him.) Jesus squatted down and scribbled on the ground with his finger. 7When they kept badgering him, he stood up, "The one of you that doesn't have any sin, throw the first stone at her." 8He squatted down again and scribbled on the ground. 9They began to go away one by one, starting with the oldest, and left him alone with the woman standing there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus stood up, "Where are they? Hasn't anybody condemned you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jesus started talking to the audience again. "I'm the light of the world. You that follow me won't be living in the dark; you'll have the light to live by."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Pharisees said, "You're testifying for yourself; your testimony's not valid."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jesus answered, "Although I'm testifying for myself, my testimony is valid because I know where I'm from and where I'm going. You don't. 15You condemn people by legal standards; I don't condemn anybody that way. 16If I do render judgment, my judgment's valid because I'm not the only witness. There's me and the Father that sent me. 17Yourpl Law says the testimony of two is valid. 18I testify for myself, and the Father testifies for me." Jesus answered, "You don't know me or him. If you knew me, you'd know him." 20He said that in the Temple Treasury, and nobody arrested him; it wasn't time yet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He told them again, "I'm going away. You'llpl look for me and die in your sinsg. You can't go where I'm going."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The Jews said, "He's not going to kill himself, is he?—because he said, "You can't go where I'm going."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He said, "You're from below; I'm from above. You're from this world; I'm not. 24I said you'd die in your sins because if you don't believe who I am, you will die in your sins." "Exactly what I've been telling you all along. 26I have a lot to say about you and judgments to make, but the One that sent me is the real basis for it. What I've heard from him is what I'm telling the world." 27(They didn't know he was talking about the Father; 28so he said,) "When you lift up the Son of Man, you'll know who I am and that I'm not saying anything but what I got from the Father. 29The One that sent me is with me. He hasn't left me alone, because I always do what pleases him." 30While he was saying that, many believed in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then he told the Jews that believed him, "If you keep following what I say, you really are my disciples. 32You'll know the truth, and the truth will set you free." 33"We're Abraham's descendants. We've never been servants to anybody. What do you mean, 'You'll be free'?" 34"Everybody that sins is a servant to sin. 35A servant is not a part of the family. A son is. 36So if a son sets you free, you really are free. 37I know you're Abraham's descendants, but you're trying to kill me because you don't want to hear what I'm saying. 38I'm telling you what I've seen my Father do, and you're doing what you've seen your father do." "If you were Abraham's children, you'd be acting like Abraham. 40But you're trying to kill me now, a man that's told you the truth I heard from God. Abraham didn't act like that. 41You're doing what your father does." 42"If God were your Father, you'd love me because I've came from him. I haven't come on my own; he sent me. 43Why don't you understand what I'm saying? Can't you hear? 44You belong to your father the devil, and you want to do what he wants you to do. He was a murderer from the beginning and doesn't stand for the truth. There's no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he's doing his own thing because he's a liar and invented lying. 45Because I'm telling the truth, you don't believe me. 46Which of you can convict me of wrongdoing? If I'm telling the truth, why don't you believe me? 47Whoever belongs to God listens to God. Here's the reason you don't listen: you don't belong to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I do respect my Father, and you disrespect me. 50I'm not trying to honor myself. There is One who seeks and condemns. 51Truth is, if anybody keeps what I say, he'll never die." 52The Jews said, "Now we know you've got a demon. Abraham died and the prophets died, but you're saying, 'If anybody keeps what I say, he'll never die.' 53You aren't greater, are you, than our ancestor Abraham that died and the prophets that died? Who do you think you are anyway?" 54"If I honor myself, it's not important. My Father honors me—who you say is your God. 55You don't even know him, but I do. If I said I didn't, I'd be lying like youpl. But I know him and keep his word. 56Your ancestor Abraham was overjoyed at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was happy." 59They picked up stones to throw at him, but he was hidden and left the Temple.</span>
