## John Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There was a man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. 2That was the Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Lazarus was her brother. 3His sisters sent to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When he heard it, he said, "He's not going to die from this sickness; it's for God's praise so it can praise God's Son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Now Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus. 6So when he heard Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days, 7then saidp to the disciples, "Let's go back to Judaea."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They saidp, "Rabbi, the Jews were trying to stone you just the other day, and you're going back there?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If you walk in the daylight, you won't stumble, because you have light. 10If you try to walk in the dark, you stumble because you doesn't have light coming out of yourself."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> After he said that, he told them, "Our friend Lazarus is sleeping; I'm going to wake him up."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> His disciples said, "Lord, if he's sleeping, he'll get better."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Jesus was talking about death, but they thought he was talking about rest. 14Then he told them plainly, "Lazarus has died. 15For your sake I'm glad I wasn't there, so you can believe. Let's go to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Thomas, called Didymus, said, "Let's go, too, so we can die with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When Jesus got there, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. 18Bethany was about a mile and three-quarters from Jerusalem, 19and many Jews had come to console Martha and Mary about their brother. 20When Martha heard Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house. 21Martha said, "Lord, if you'd been here, my brother wouldn't have died. 22But I know even now that whatever you ask God for, he'll give you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Martha saidp, "I know he'll rise again in the end."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Jesus said, "I'm resurrection and life. Whoever believes in me will live even though he dies. 26Everybody that lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?" 27"Yes, Lord; I've believed you're the Messiah, God's Son, who comes to the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When she'd said that, she went and called Mary privately, "The Rabbi's here; he's asking for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> She got up quickly and went to him. 30He hadn't come into the village yet; he was still where Martha met him. 31When the Jews in the house saw her get up quickly and leave, they followed her. They supposed she was going to the tomb to mourn. 32Mary came to where Jesus was and fell down to him, "Lord, if you'd been here, my brother wouldn't have died."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When Jesus saw her crying and the Jews crying that had come with her, he was deeply moved, 34"Where have youpl laid him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus began to cry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The Jews said, "See how much he loved him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Some said, "Couldn't this man that gave sight to the blind man have kept this man from dying?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> When Jesus got to the tomb, he was deeply moved. It was a cave with a stone lying against it. 39He saidp, "Take the stone away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Jesus saidp to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believe, you'd see how great God is?" They took the stone away. 41He looked up and said, "Father, thank you for listening to me. 42I know you always do, but I've said it for the crowd standing here so they would believe you've sent me." 43Then he shouted, "Lazarus, come out!" 44The dead man came out wrapped hand to foot with strips of cloth; his face was wrapped in a facecloth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Many Jews that came to Mary believed in Jesus when they saw what he did; 46but some of them went and told the Pharisees what he'd done. 47So the high priests and the Pharisees called the Sanhedrin into session. "What are we going to do? This man is doing lots of signs. 48If we let him keep doing this, everybody's going to believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and nation."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Caiaphas, high priest that year, said, "There's something you don't understand: 50It's to your advantage that one man die for the people so the whole nation doesn't perish." 51He didn't say this on his own; but as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 52and not just for the nation, but that he'd gather into one body the children of God scattered abroad. 53From then on, they conspired to put him to death. 54So Jesus quit moving around openly among the Jews and went away to the territory close to the desert—to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his disciples. 55Now the Jews' Passover was coming up, and people from around Ephraim went up to Jerusalem ahead of time to purify themselves ceremonially. 56People were looking for Jesus and saying to one another in the Temple, "What do you think? Surely he won't come to the festival." 57The chief priests and the Pharisees had passed laws that anybody that knew where he was should report it so they could arrest him.</span>
