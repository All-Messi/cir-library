## John Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>There was a man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>That was the Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Lazarus was her brother. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>His sisters sent to Jesus, <em>“Lord, the one you love is sick.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When he heard it, he said, <em>“</em><em>He’s not going to die from this sickness</em><em>; it’s for </em><em>God’s</em><em> </em><em>praise</em><em> so </em><em>it can praise God’s</em><em> Son.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Now Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So when he heard Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>then said<sup>p</sup> to the disciples, <em>“Let’s go back to Judaea.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Rabbi, the Jews were trying to stone you</em><em> just the other day</em><em>, and you’re going back there?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight?</em><em> </em><em>If </em><em>you</em><em> walk in the daylight, </em><em>you</em><em> </em><em>wo</em><em>n’t stumble, because </em><em>you have</em><em> light.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>If </em><em>you</em><em> </em><em>try to walk in the dark, you stumble</em><em> because </em><em>you</em><em> doesn’t have light </em><em>coming out of your</em><em>self.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	Jn </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>1-10</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After he said that, he told them, <em>“Our friend Lazarus is </em><em>sleeping; </em><em>I’m going to wake him up.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>His disciples said, <em>“Lord, if he’s </em><em>sleeping</em><em>, he’ll get better.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus was talking about <u>death</u>, but they thought he was talking about <u>rest</u>. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Then he told them plainly, <em>“Lazarus has died.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>F</em><em>or your sake I’m glad I wasn’t there, so you can believe.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s go to him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Thomas, called Didymus, said,<em> “Let’s go</em><em>,</em><em> too</em><em>,</em><em> so we can die with him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When Jesus got there, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Bethany was about a mile and three-quarters from Jerusalem, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and many Jews had come to console Martha and Mary about their brother. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When Martha heard Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Martha said, <em>“Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But I know even now that whatever you ask God for</em><em>,</em><em> he’ll give you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Martha said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“I know he’ll rise again </em><em>in the end</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“</em><em><u>I</u></em><em><u>’m</u></em><em> resurrection and life.</em><em> </em><em>Whoever believes in me will live even though he die</em><em>s</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Everybody that l</em><em>ives and believes in me will never</em><em> die.</em><em> </em><em>Do you believe that?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When she’d said that, she went and called Mary privately, <em>“The Rabbi’s here; he’</em><em>s asking for you.”</em><em>	</em><strong> </strong><strong>Jn </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>11-28</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>She got up quickly and went to him. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He hadn’t come into the village yet; he was still where Martha met him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>When the Jews in the house saw her get up quickly and leave, they followed her. They supposed she was going to the tomb to mourn. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Mary came to where Jesus was and fell down to him, <em>“Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When Jesus saw her crying and the Jews crying that had come with her, he was deeply moved, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>“Where have you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> laid him?”</em> They said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>We’ll show you</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus began to cry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The Jews said, <em>“See how much he </em><em>loved</em><em> him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Some said, <em>“Couldn’t </em><em>this man that</em><em> gave sight to the blind man have kept this man from dying?”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	Jn </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>29</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>37</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> When Jesus got to the tomb, he was deeply moved. It was a cave with a stone lying against it. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Take the stone away.”</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	                   </em> <em>Martha</em> said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Lord, by now he smells; he’s been dead </em><em>four</em><em> days.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Jesus said<sup>p</sup> to her, <em>“Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you’d see </em><em>how great God is</em><em>?”</em> They took the stone away. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He looked up and said, <em>“Father, thank you for listen</em><em>ing</em><em> to</em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>I know you always </em><em>do</em><em>, but I</em><em>’ve</em><em> s</em><em>aid it for the crowd standing here</em><em> so they would believe you’ve sent me.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong>Then he shouted, <em>“Lazarus, come out!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>The dead man came out wrapped hand to foot with strips of cloth; his face was wrapped in a facecloth. Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Unwrap him and </em><em>set</em><em> him</em><em> free</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Jn 11:</strong><strong>38</strong><strong>-44</strong> <strong>Plots to Kill Jesus</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Many Jews that came to Mary believed in Jesus when they saw what he did; <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>but some of them went and told the Pharisees what he’d done. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>So the high priests and the Pharisees called the Sanhedrin into session. <em>“What are we going to do? This man is doing lots of signs.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>If we </em><em>let him keep doing</em><em> this, everybody’s going to believe in him, and the Romans will come</em><em> and take away our place and</em><em> nation.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Caiaphas, high priest that year, said, <em>“There’s something you don’t understand:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>It’s </em><em>to your advantage</em><em> that one man die for the people so the whole nation doesn’t perish.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong>He didn’t say this on his own; but as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>and not just for the nation, but that he’d gather into one <em>body</em> the children of God scattered abroad. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>From then on, they conspired to put him to death. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>So Jesus quit moving around openly among the Jews and went away to the territory close to the desert—to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his disciples.</span>
