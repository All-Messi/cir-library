## John Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>There was a sick man, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha her sister.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>This was the Mary that anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Lazarus was her brother.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>His sisters sent to Jesus, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, the one you love is sick.” </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>When he heard it, he said, </strong><strong><em>“This sickness isn’t to death; it’s for the glory of God so the Son of God can be glorified by it.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup><strong>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em><sup>6</sup></em></strong><strong>So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>Afterwards he said to the disciples, </strong><strong><em>“Let’s go back to Judaea.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>They said, </strong><strong><em>“Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you, and you’re going back there?” </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>Jesus answered, </strong><strong><em>“Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight?</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>If a person walks in the daylight, he doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of the world.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><strong><em>If a person walks in the dark, he stumbles, because he doesn’t have light in himself.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>After he said this, he told them, </strong><strong><em>“Our f</em></strong><strong><em>riend Lazarus is asleep, but I’</em></strong><strong><em>m going to wake him up.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>His disciples said, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, if he’s asleep, he’ll get better.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>Jesus had been talking about the </strong><strong><u>death</u></strong><strong> of Lazarus, but they thought he was talking about sleep as in rest.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><strong>Then he told them </strong><strong>plainly, </strong><strong><em>“Lazarus has died.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em><sup>15</sup></em></strong><strong><em>I’m glad for your sake that I wasn’t there, so you can believe.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Let’s go to him</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>Then Thomas, called Didymus, said,</strong><strong><em> “Let’s go too so we can die with him.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>When Jesus got there, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><strong>Now Bethany was</strong><strong> a little</strong><strong> less than two miles from Jerusalem.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><strong>Many Jews had come to console Mary and Martha about their brother.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong>When Martha heard Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, but Mary </strong><strong>continued to sit</strong><strong> in the house</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><strong>Martha said, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. </em></strong><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><strong><em>But I know even now that whatever you ask God for he’ll give you.”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><strong><em>“Your brother will rise again.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>Martha said, </strong><strong><em>“I know he’ll rise again in the resurrection at the end of time.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“I am resurrection and life.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Whoever believes i</em></strong><strong><em>n me will live even though he’</em></strong><strong><em>s died.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><strong><em>Everybody that lives and believes in me will not die forever.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Do you believe that?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><strong>“Yes, Lord; I’ve believed you’re the Messiah, God’s Son, who comes into the world.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>Having said this, s</strong><strong>he went and cal</strong><strong>led Mary privately, </strong><strong><em>“The Rabbi’</em></strong><strong><em>s here and is asking for you.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>When she heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><strong>Now he </strong><strong>had not </strong><strong>come</strong><strong> in the village yet;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>he</strong><strong> was still where Martha met him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><sup> </sup><strong>When</strong><strong> the Jews in the house with Mary saw her get up quickly and leave, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to mourn.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><strong>Mary came to where Jesus was and fe</strong><strong>ll at his feet, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, if you’d been here, my brother </em></strong><strong><em>wouldn’t</em></strong><strong><em> have died.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>When Jesus saw her crying and the ones coming with her crying, he was deeply moved and troubled in himself, </strong><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><strong><em>“Where have you laid him?”</em></strong> <strong>	They said, </strong><strong><em>“Come and see.”</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup><strong>Jesus began to cry.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup><strong>The Jews said, </strong><strong><em>“See how much he loved him.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup><strong>Some said, </strong><strong><em>“Couldn’t he who gave sight to the blind man have kept this man from dying?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup><strong>When Jesus </strong><strong>got</strong><strong> to the tomb, he was deeply moved.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>It was a cave with a stone lying against it.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><strong>He said, </strong><strong><em>“Take the stone away.”</em></strong> <strong>Martha said, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, by now he smells; he’s been dead four days.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup><strong>Jesus said to her, </strong><strong><em>“Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you’d see </em></strong><strong><em>God’s glory</em></strong><strong><em>?”</em></strong> <strong>They took the stone away.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><strong>Then he looked up and said, </strong><strong><em>“Father, thank you for hearing me.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><strong><em>I know you always hear me, but I said it for the crowd standing </em></strong><strong><em>by, so they’</em></strong><strong><em>d believe that you’ve sent me.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><strong>When he said this, he shouted, </strong><strong><em>“Lazarus, come out!</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><strong>The dead man came out bound hand </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> foot with strips of cloth</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and his face wrapped </strong><strong>in</strong><strong> a facecloth.</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“Unwrap him and free him.”</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong></span>
