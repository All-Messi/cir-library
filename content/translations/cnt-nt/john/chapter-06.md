## John Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>After this Jesus went away beyond the Sea of Galilee (Sea of Tiberias).</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>A large crowd followed him, because they saw the signs he was doing on the sick.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>He went up on a hill and sat down with his disciples.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>The Passover feast of the Jews was coming. </strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>Then Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd arriving, and said to Philip, </strong><strong><em>“Where will we buy bread so these can eat?”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>(He </strong><strong>said</strong><strong> this to test him, because </strong><strong><u>he</u></strong><strong> knew what he was going to do.)</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><strong>Philip answered, </strong><strong><em>“Two hundred </em></strong><strong><em>days’ wages</em></strong><strong><em> worth of bread won’t be enough for each person to get </em></strong><strong><em>even </em></strong><strong><em>a little bit</em></strong><strong><em>.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup><strong>One disciple said to him—Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong><em>“There’s a boy here </em></strong><strong><em>that has</em></strong><strong><em> five</em></strong><strong><em> loaves and two fish, but what’</em></strong><strong><em>s that for so many?”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup><strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“Have the people sit down.”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>There was lots of grass in the place.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>So they sat down—about five thousand men.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><strong>Jesus took the loaves, bl</strong><strong>essed them, and gave them to those seated—the fish too, as much as people wanted.</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><strong>When they were full, he told his disciples, </strong><strong><em>“Pick up the leftover pieces so nothing is </em></strong><strong><em>wasted</em></strong><strong><em>.”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><strong>So they picked up the leftovers and filled twelve baskets with pieces from the five barley loaves that increased for those who had eaten.</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><strong>People that saw the sign said, </strong><strong><em>“This is truly the prophet that’s coming into the world.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><strong>Jesus kne</strong><strong>w they intended to come and tak</strong><strong>e him </strong><strong>by force </strong><strong>to make </strong><strong>him king, and </strong><strong>he withdrew </strong><strong>up</strong><strong> the </strong><strong>hill</strong><strong> by himself.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>     </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>    </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>          </strong></span>
