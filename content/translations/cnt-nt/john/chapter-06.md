## John Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After that, Jesus went to the other side of Lake Galilee (<em>Lake </em>Tiberias). <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>A big crowd followed him because they saw the signs he was performing on the sick. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He went up on a hillside and sat down with his disciples. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The Jews’ Passover Festival was coming up. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus looked up and saw a huge crowd arriving, and said to Philip, <em>“Where </em><em>are we going to</em><em> buy </em><em>enough bread for</em><em> these </em><em>people to</em><em> eat?”</em><em> </em>(<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He said that to test him because <em>Jesus</em> <em>already</em> knew what he was going to do.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Philip answered, <em>“</em><em>B</em><em>read </em><em>worth 200 denarii </em><em>won’t be enough for each person to get even a little bit.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said<sup>p</sup>, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“There’s a boy here </em><em>that has</em><em> five </em><em>barley loaves and two fish, but what good i</em><em>s that </em><em>for this big crowd</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus said, <em>“Have the</em><em>m</em><em> sit down.”</em> There was lots of grass there, so they sat down—about 5,000 men. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Jesus took the loaves, blessed them, and gave them to the ones that were sitting there—the fish too, as much as people wanted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When they were full, he told his disciples, <em>“Pick up the le</em><em>ftover pieces so nothing’s wasted</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>So they filled twelve baskets with scraps from the five barley loaves that Jesus had multiplied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The people that saw the sign said, <em>“This real</em><em>ly </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> the prophet that’s supposed to come</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Jesus knew they intended to take him by force to make him king, so he withdrew up the hill alone.</span>

### Jesus Walking on the Water


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>got in a boat, and headed over to Capernaum. It was dark now, and Jesus hadn’t come. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The lake was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>When they’d rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the lake, getting close to the boat, and it scared them. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>But he said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“It’s me; don’t be afraid.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>So they came to take him into the boat, and presently the boat landed where they were headed.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jn</strong><strong> </strong><strong>6:16-21</strong> <strong>Jesus’ Refusal to Be a Political </strong><strong>Messiah</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The next day the crowd that was standing back on the other side of the lake, saw that no other small boat had been there except the one Jesus hadn’t got into with his disciples; they’d left by themselves. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Other small boats came from Tiberias to where the people ate the bread the Lord had blessed. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When the crowd saw that he and his disciples weren’t around, they got in <em>those </em>small boats and went to Capernaum, looking for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said, <em>“Rabbi, when did you get here?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“You’re looking for me, not so much because you saw signs, but because you ate </em><em>bread</em><em> </em><em>till you</em><em> were full.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Don’t work for bread that </em><em>molds</em><em>, b</em><em>ut for bread that stays freesh forever. That’s the </em>kind of <em>bread</em><em> the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> will give you, because he’s the One the Father has marked with a seal.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They asked him, <em>“What’ll we do to be working </em><em>God’s</em><em> works?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“This is </em><em>God’s</em><em> </em><em>‘</em><em>work</em><em>’: believe i</em><em>n the One he sent.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They said, <em>“What sign are</em><em> you do</em><em>ing</em><em> so we can see </em><em>it </em><em>and believe?</em><em> </em><em>What ‘work’ do you do?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>Our ances</em><em>tors ate manna in the desert like</em><em> </em><em>scripture says</em><em>, </em><strong><em>‘He gav</em></strong><strong><em>e them bread from heaven to eat</em></strong><strong><em>’”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 78:24]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Jesus said, <em>“Moses didn’t give you bread from </em><em>heaven</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>My Fathe</em><em>r is giving you the real ‘bread</em><em> from heaven.</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>God’s ‘bread’ is the One </em><em>that</em><em> </em><em>has come</em><em> down from heaven to give life to the world.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Jn</strong><strong> </strong><strong>6:</strong><strong>22-33</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They said, <em>“Sir, </em><em>give us that bread all the time!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“</em><em><u>I’m</u></em><em> the life-giving bread.</em><em> </em><em>Whoever comes to me will never get hungry</em><em>;</em><em> whoever </em><em>trusts</em><em> in me will never get thirsty.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>But, you’</em><em>ve seen me and not </em><em>believed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and </em><em>whoever </em><em>comes to me I won’t </em><em>reject;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>because I</em><em> haven’t</em><em> come down from heaven to do </em><em><u>my</u></em><em> will, but the will of the One that sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>This is his will:</em><em> </em><em>that I not lose anything he’s given me, </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>that everybody </em><em>who</em><em> sees the Son and </em><em>believes</em><em> in him</em><em> may have eternal life, and I</em><em> raise him up in the </em><em>end</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> The Jews started grumbling because he said, <em>“I’m the bread that’s come down from heaven.”</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>They were saying, <em>“Isn’t this Jesus, </em><em>Joseph’s</em><em> son?</em><em> </em><em>We</em><em> know</em><em> his </em><em>parents</em><em>.</em><em> How can</em><em> he </em><em>be saying now that he</em><em> </em><em>has </em><em>come down from heaven?”</em><em> </em><em>	</em><strong>Jn</strong><strong> </strong><strong>6:</strong><strong>34-42</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“Don’t grumble </em><em>around </em><em>with one another.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>Nobody can come to me unless the </em><em><u>Father</u></em><em> that sent me is drawing him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>he prophets</em><em> wrote</em><em>, </em><strong><em>‘God will teach them all’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 54:13]</strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong><em>Everybody that listens to the Father and learns</em><em>,</em><em> comes to me—</em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>not that anybody has seen </em><em>him</em><em> except the One </em><em>that’s come</em><em> from </em><em>him</em><em>; he’s seen him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>Whoever </em><em>believes</em><em> has eternal life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>I’m the life-giving ‘bread.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and died.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>No</em><em>body that eats th</em><em>is ‘bread’ from </em><em>heaven will </em><em>die.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>I’m the life-giving ‘bread’ that comes from heaven.</em><em> Everybody</em><em> </em><em>that </em><em>eats this ‘bread’</em><em> wi</em><em>ll live forever.</em><em> </em><em>Yes, and the ‘bread’ I’ll give for the life of the world is my own flesh.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Jn</strong><strong> </strong><strong>6:</strong><strong>43-51</strong></span>
