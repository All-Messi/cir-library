## John Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, 2came to Jesus at night, "Rabbi, we know you're a teacher from God. Nobody can do the signs you do unless God's with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Jesus answered, "Unless a person has been born again, he can't see God's kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Nicodemus saidp, "How can you be born when you're an adult? You can't get into your mother's womb a second time and be born, can you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jesus answered, "Unless you've been born of water and spirit, he can't get into God's kingdom. 6What's born out of the physical is physical; what's born out of the spiritual is spiritual. 7Don't be surprised that I told yousg youpl have to be born again. 8The wind blows where it wants to. Yousg hear it, but you can't tell where it's from or where it's going. That's how everybody is that's born out of the spirit."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Nicodemus responded, "What are you talking about?" 10"You're a teacher in Israel and don't understand that? 11I'm telling yousg, we're talking about what we know and have seen, and youpl don't accept what we're telling you. 12If youpl don't believe my earthly illustrations, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly ones? 13Nobody has gone up to heaven except the One that came down from heaven, the Son of Man. 14As Moses held up the brazen viper in the desert, the Son of Man needs to be held up 15so everybody that believes can in him have eternal life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> God cared about the world so much he gave his only Son so anybody that trusts in him wouldn't perish but have eternal life. 17God didn't send his Son to the world to condemn it, but to save it. 18Whoever trusts in him is not condemned, but whoever doesn't, stands condemned for not trusting in God's only Son. 19Here's the condemnation: light has come into the world, but people like darkness better than light because they do bad things. 20People that do bad things hate light and don't come to it; they don't want their deeds condemned. 21But people that do the truth come to the light to show that they're doing what God wants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> After that, Jesus and his disciples went to Judaea, and he stayed there baptizing. 23John was baptizing too—at Aenon close to Salem; there was a good supply of water there. 24(Herod hadn't put John in prison yet.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> A controversy about purification came up between John's disciples and a Jew. 26They came to John and said, "Rabbi, the man that was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you vouched for—is baptizing, and everybody's going to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> John answered, "A person can't receive anything unless Heaven lets him. 28You heard me say I'm not the Messiah; 'I've been sent ahead of him.' 29The groom has the bride, but the best man enjoys listening to him talk. I'm perfectly content, then, with this situation. 30He needs to increase; I need to decrease. 31"The One from above is above everything; someone from the earth talks about the earth. 32The One from above talks about what he's seen and heard, and people tend not to accept what he says. 33Whoever does accept it, is acknowledging that God tells the truth. 34The One that God sent speaks God's message; he gives the spirit without measure. 35The Father loves the Son and has turned everything over to him. 36Whoever trusts in him has eternal life; whoever doesn't, won't see life. God's displeasure rests on him."</span>
