## John Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>came to Jesus at night, <em>“Rabbi, we know you’re a teach</em><em>er from God. N</em><em>obody can do the signs you do unless God’s with him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“Unless a person has been</em><em> born again, he can’t see </em><em>God’s kingdom</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Nicodemus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“How can </em><em>you</em><em> be born when </em><em>you’re an adult</em><em>?</em><em> You</em><em> can’t </em><em>get into</em><em> </em><em>your</em><em> mother’s womb a second time and be born, can </em><em>you</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“Unless you’ve been</em><em> born of water and spirit, he can’t </em><em>get into God’s kingdom</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>What’s born out of</em><em> the phys</em><em>ical is physical; what’s born out of</em><em> the spiritual is spiritual.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Don’t be surprised that I </em><em>told</em><em> you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> </em><em>y</em><em>ou</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> have to be born again.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The wind blows where</em><em> it wants to. Y</em><em>ou</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> hear </em><em>it</em><em>, but you can’t tell where </em><em>it’s</em><em> from or where it’s going.</em><em> </em><em>That’s </em><em>how</em><em> everybody is that’s born </em><em>out of </em><em>the spirit.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Nicodemus responded, <em>“</em><em>What </em><em><u>are</u></em><em> you talking about</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> God cared about the world so much he gave his only Son so anybody that trusts in him wouldn’t perish but have eternal life. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>God didn’t send his Son to the world to condemn it, but to save it. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Whoever trusts in him is not condemned, but whoever doesn’t, stands condemned for not trusting in God’s only Son. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Here’s the condemnation: light has come into the world, but people like darkness better than light because they do bad things. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>People that do bad things hate light and don’t come to it; they don’t want their deeds condemned. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>But people that do the truth come to the light to show that they’re doing what God wants.</span>

### Jesus’ Growing Ministry and  John’s Waning Ministry at Aenon


<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>After that, Jesus and his disciples went to Judaea, and he stayed there baptizing. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>John was baptizing too—at Aenon close to Salem; there was a good supply of water there. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>(Herod hadn’t put John in prison yet.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> A controversy about purification came up between John’s disciples and a Jew. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They came to John and said, <em>“Rabbi, the man that was with you </em><em>on the other side of</em><em> the Jordan—the one you </em><em>vouched</em><em> for—is baptizing</em><em>,</em><em> and everybody’s going to him.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>John answered, <em>“A person</em><em> can’t receive anything unless H</em><em>eaven lets him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>You </em><em>heard me say I’m not the Messiah;</em><em> ‘I’ve been sent ahead of him.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>The groom has the bride, but the </em><em>best man enjoys listening to</em><em> hi</em><em>m talk</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I’m perfectly </em><em>content,</em><em> then</em><em>,</em><em> with this situation.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>He needs to increase; I need to decrease.</em></span>
