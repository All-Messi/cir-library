## John Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Jesus went up to a festival of the Jews in Jerusalem. 2By the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there's a pool with five porches, called Bethzatha in Hebrew. 3A crowd of sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed people was lying in those porches. [4]ms 5One fellow had been in his condition for 38 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jesus saw him and knew he'd been there a long time. "Do you want to get well?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The crippled man answered, "Sir, I don't have anybody to take me into the pool when the water stirs. While I'm making my way down, somebody else gets there ahead of me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus toldp him, "Get up, pick up your bedroll, and walk."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Right away the fellow was sound. He picked up his bedroll and started walking. 	Jn 5:1-9a It was a Sabbath, 10so the Jews started telling him, 11"It's against the Law to be carrying your bedroll."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He didn't know because he hadn't noticed Jesus leave in the crowd. 14Later, Jesus found him in the Temple, "You've been made well. Don't sin anymore so something worse doesn't happen to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The man left and told the Jews it was Jesus that had cured him. 16They started harassing Jesus because he did it on a Sabbath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working till now, and so am I."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now the Jews tried to do more to him—to put him to death. Not only had he broken the Sabbath; he said God was his Father. That made him equal to deity. 	Jn 5:9b-18</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jesus answered them, "The Son of Man can't do anything on his own. He does what he sees the Father do. 20The Father loves the Son and shows him what he's doing; he'll show him greater deeds than these to amaze you. 21As the Father raises the dead, so the Son makes alive the ones he wants to. 22The Father doesn't judge anybody; he's given judgment to the Son 23so everybody will respect the Son like they do the Father. Whoever doesn't respect the Son doesn't respect the Father that sent him. 24Whoever listens to what the Son says and believes the One who sent him, has eternal life and doesn't end up condemned. He's crossed over from death to life. 25The time's coming—it's already here—when the dead will hear the Son and come to life. 26As the Father has life in himself, he's enabled the Son to have life in himself. 27And he's given him authority to judge because he's a human being. 28"Don't be surprised that the time's coming when everybody in the tombs will hear him. 29The ones that did good things will come out to a resurrection that leads to life. The ones that did bad things will come out to a resurrection that leads to condemnation. 30"I can't do anything on my own. As I hear I judge, and my judgment is just, because I'm not trying to accomplish my own purpose, but the purpose of the One that sent me. 31"If I speak for myself, you might consider suspect what I'm saying. 32There's somebody else that vouches for me, and I know his testimony about me is true: 33you've sent to John, and he's vouched for the truth. 34I don't receive people's claims about me, but I do say this so you can be saved: 35John was a burning, shining lamp, and you were happy for a while in his light. 36But I present greater testimony than John did. The works the Father has given me to accomplish speak for the fact that he sent me. 37The Father that sent me has spoken for me. You haven't heard him speak or seen him, 38and you don't believe in the One he sent. 39Search the scriptures, because you suppose you have eternal life in them, and they talk about me. 40You don't want to come to me to have life. 41"I don't accept honor from people; 42I know you don't love God. 43I've come in my Father's name, and you don't accept me. If others comes in their own name, youpl accept them. 44How can you believe when you accept honor from one another instead of striving for the honor that only comes from God? 45Don't suppose I'm going to accuse you to the Father. Moses accuses you, the one you've put your faith in. 46If you believed Moses, you'd believe me because he wrote about me. 47If you don't believe what he wrote, how can you believe what I say?"</span>
