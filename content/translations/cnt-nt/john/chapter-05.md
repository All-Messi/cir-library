## John Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After that, Jesus went up to a festival of the Jews in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>By the Sheep <em>Gate </em>in Jerusalem there’s a pool with five porches, called Bethzatha in Hebrew. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A crowd of sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed people was lying in those porches. [<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>]<sup>ms </sup><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>One fellow had been in his condition for 38 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jesus saw him and knew he’d been there a long time. <em>“</em><em>Do</em><em> you want to </em><em>get well</em><em>?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The crippled man answered, <em>“Sir, I don’t have anybody to take m</em><em>e into the pool when the water stirs</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>While I’m making my way down, somebody else gets there ahead of me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus told<sup>p</sup> him, <em>“Get up, pick up your bedroll, and walk.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Right away the fellow was sound. He picked up his bedroll and started walking.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jn 5:1-</strong><strong>9a</strong> It was a Sabbath, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>so the Jews started telling him,<em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em>t’s against the </em><em>L</em><em>aw to be carrying your bedroll.”</em> He answered, <em>“The One that </em><em>made me well</em><em> told me</em><em> to p</em><em>ick </em><em>it </em><em>u</em><em>p</em><em> and walk.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He didn’t know because he hadn’t noticed Jesus leave in the crowd. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Later, Jesus found him in the Temple, <em>“You’ve been made well. D</em><em>on’t sin anymore so something worse doesn’t happen to you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The man left and told the Jews it was Jesus that had cured him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They started harassing Jesus because he did it on a Sabbath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But Jesus answered them, <em>“My Father ha</em><em>s been working till now, and so am I</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now the Jews tried to do more to him—to put him to death. Not only had he broken the Sabbath; he said God was his Father. That made him equal to deity.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jn 5:</strong><strong>9b-18</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jesus answered them, <em>“The </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> can’t do anything on his own</em><em>. H</em><em>e </em><em>does what he </em><em>sees the </em><em>Father do</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The Father loves</em><em> the Son and shows him what he’s doing; he’</em><em>ll show him greater deeds than these </em><em>t</em><em>o amaze</em><em> you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>As the Father raises the dead, so the Son makes alive the ones he wants to.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>The Fat</em><em>her doesn’t judge anybody; he’</em><em>s given judgment to the Son </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>so </em><em>everybody will respect the Son like</em><em> they do the Father.</em><em> </em><em>Whoever doesn’t respect the Son doesn’t respect the Father that sent him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Whoever </em><em>listens to what </em><em>the Son says</em><em> and believes the One </em><em>who </em><em>s</em><em>ent him, has eternal life and doesn’t end up condemned. He’</em><em>s crossed over from death to life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>The time’s coming—</em><em>it’s already here</em><em>—when the dead will hear the Son and come to life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>As the F</em><em>ather has life in himself, he’</em><em>s enabled </em><em>the Son to have life in himself. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>A</em><em>nd</em><em> he’</em><em>s given him </em><em>authority</em><em> to </em><em>judge because he’</em><em>s a human being.</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>Jn 5:1</strong><strong>9-2</strong><strong>7</strong></span>
