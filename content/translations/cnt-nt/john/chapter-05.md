## John Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup>1</sup><strong>After this came a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>At the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there was a pool with five porches called </strong><strong><em>Bethesda</em></strong><strong> in Hebrew.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>In these porches lay a crowd of infirm, blind, lame, and paralyzed people.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>] </strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>One fellow there had been in his condition for thirty-eight years.</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><strong>W</strong><strong>hen Jesus saw him and knew he’</strong><strong>d already been there a long time, he said,</strong> <strong><em>	“Are you wanting to be cured?” </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>The crippled man answered, </strong><strong><em>“Sir, I do</em></strong><strong><em>n’t have anybody to take me in</em></strong><strong><em> the pool when the water </em></strong><strong><em>stirs </em></strong><strong><em>up.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>While I’m making my way down, somebody else gets there ahead of me.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>Jesus told him, </strong><strong><em>“Get up, pick up your bedroll, and walk.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><strong>Right away the fellow was cured, took up his bedroll, and started walking.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><strong>That day was the Sabbath.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>So the Jews started telling the cured man, </strong><strong><em>“It’s the Sabbath; </em></strong><strong><em><sup>11</sup></em></strong><strong><em>it’s against the law for you to be carrying your bedroll.”</em></strong> <strong>	He answered, </strong><strong><em>“The One that cured me told me, ‘Pick up your bedroll and walk.’”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>They asked him, </strong><strong><em>“Who told you that?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><strong>The cured man </strong><strong>didn’t know who it was, because Jesus had conveyed himself away in the crowd.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><strong>Later, Jesus found him in the temple and said, </strong><strong><em>“You’ve been cured; don’t sin anymore so something worse doesn’t happen to you.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>The man went and told the Jews it was Jesus that </strong><strong>cured him</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><strong>On this account the Jews began to harass Jesus, because he did it on the Sabbath.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>But Jesus answered them, </strong><strong><em>“My Father has been working till now</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong><strong><em> and I am working.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>Now the Jews tried to do mo</strong><strong>re to him and put him to death.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>N</strong><strong>ot only </strong><strong>had</strong><strong> he br</strong><strong>oken</strong><strong> the Sabbath, he God was his Father, making himself equal to God.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>Jesus answered them, </strong> <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>T</em></strong><strong><em>he Son of </em></strong><strong><em>M</em></strong><strong><em>an can’t do anything on his own unless he sees the Father do it.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>What he does the Son does too.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong><em>The Father loves</em></strong><strong><em> the Son and shows him what he’</em></strong><strong><em>s doing, and will show him gr</em></strong><strong><em>eater deeds than these so you’</em></strong><strong><em>ll be amazed.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><strong><em>As the Father raises the dead and makes them live, so also the Son makes alive the ones he wants to.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><strong><em>The Father doesn’t judge anybody; he has given all judgment to the Son, </em></strong><strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><em>so everybody will respect the Son as they do the Father.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Whoever doesn’t respect the Son doesn’t respect the Father that sent him.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><strong><em>T</em></strong><strong><em>he one that listens to what I’m</em></strong><strong><em> saying and believes the One that</em></strong><strong><em> sent me has eternal life and does</em></strong><strong><em>n’t wns up</em></strong><strong><em>condemn</em></strong><strong><em>ed</em></strong><strong><em>; he has crossed over from death to life.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><strong><em>The time’s coming—</em></strong><strong><em>an</em></strong><strong><em>d is now—</em></strong><strong><em>when the dead will hear the Son and come to life.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><strong><em>As the Father has life in himself, he has enabled the Son to have life in himself, </em></strong><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><strong><em>and has given him the authority to render judgment, because he is a human being.</em></strong> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><strong>“Don’t be amazed that the time’s coming when everybody in the tombs will hear him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><strong>Those who did good things will come out into the resurrection of life, and those who did evil things into the resurrection of condemnation.</strong> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong><strong>“I can’t do anything on my own.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>As I hear I judge</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and my judgment is just, because I’m not trying to accomplish my own purpose, but the purpose of the One that sent me.</strong> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><strong>“If I testify</strong><strong> about myself, you might consider my testimony suspect.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><strong>There is somebody else that testifies about me, and I know his testimony is true:</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><strong>you have sent to John, and he testified to the truth.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><strong>I don’t receive testimony from </strong><strong>man</strong><strong>, but I do say this so you can be saved:</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><strong>John was a burning, shining lamp, and you were willing to be happy for a while in his light.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><strong>B</strong><strong>ut I have greater testimony than</strong><strong> John’s:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the deeds the Father has given me to do testify that he sent me.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><strong>The Father </strong><strong>has testified about me.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>You’v</strong><strong>e n</strong><strong>ot heard him speak </strong><strong>or seen him,</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><strong>and you don’t believe in the One he sent.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><strong>Search the scriptures, because you suppose you have eternal life in them, and they testify about me.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><strong>You don’t </strong><strong><u>want</u></strong><strong> to come to me to </strong><strong>have life.</strong> <strong><sup>41</sup></strong><strong>“I</strong><strong> don’t accept glory from </strong><strong>man</strong><strong>, </strong><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><strong>but I know you don’t </strong><strong>love</strong><strong> God.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><strong>I’ve come in my Father</strong><strong>’s name</strong><strong>, and you don’t accept </strong><strong><u>me</u></strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>If somebody comes in his own name, you</strong><strong><sup>pl </sup></strong><strong>accept </strong><strong><u>him</u></strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><strong>How can you believe when you accept glory from one another</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and don’t seek glory from God alone?</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><strong>Don’t suppose I’m going to</strong><strong> accuse you to the Father.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Moses</strong><strong> </strong><strong>accuses you</strong><strong>, the one you’</strong><strong>ve put your faith in.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><strong>If you believed Moses, you</strong><strong>’d</strong><strong> be believing me, because he wrote about me.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><strong>If you don’t believe </strong><strong>what he wrote</strong><strong>, how will you believe what I say?</strong><strong>”</strong><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>     </strong><strong> </strong><strong>	            </strong></span>
