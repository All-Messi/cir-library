## John Chapter **19**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>The</strong><strong>n</strong><strong> Pilate took Jesus and had him </strong><strong>flogged</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>The soldiers twisted thorns together to make a crown, and put it on his head.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>They put a purple robe on him, </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>and </strong><strong>started</strong><strong> coming up to him and saying, </strong><strong><em>“Hail, king of the Jews!” </em></strong><strong>and slapping him.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>Pilate brought him out again, </strong><strong><em>“I’m bringing him out to let you know I don’t find </em></strong><strong><em>him guilty of anything</em></strong><strong><em>.”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>So he brought Jesus out wearing the crown o</strong><strong>f thorns and the purple robe.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>“Look at the man!”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>When the chief priests and officers saw him, they shouted, </strong><strong><em>“Crucify him!</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Crucify him!</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>	Pilate said, </strong><strong><em>“You take him and crucify him.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>I don’t find him guilty of anything.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>The Jews answered, </strong><strong><em>“We have a law</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong><strong><em> according to that law he should die, because he made himself God’s Son.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>When Pilate heard this, he became more concerned </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>and </strong><strong>went in</strong><strong> the Praetorium and said to Jesus, </strong><strong><em>“Where are you from?</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong> <strong>	Jesus didn’t answer him.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><strong>Pilate said to him, </strong><strong><em>“You aren’t talking to me?</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Y</em></strong><strong><em>ou know</em></strong><strong><em>, don’t you,</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>that </em></strong><strong><em>I have the authority to release you or crucify you?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><strong><em>“You wouldn’t have any authority over me if </em></strong><strong><em>God hadn’t allowed it</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>So the one </em></strong><strong><em>that</em></strong><strong><em> betrayed me to you has committed a worse sin.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>Pilate tried to release him, b</strong><strong>ut the Jews shouted, </strong><strong><em>“If you release this man, you’re no friend of Caesar.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Anybody that makes himself king opposes Caesar.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgement seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>Gabbatha</em></strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><strong>It was Preparation during the Passover,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>Then he delivered him to them to be crucified.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>  </strong></span>

<p class="section-ref">Jn 19</p>

### :17-18 The Death of Christ


<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>Pilate wrote an inscription and put it on the cross:</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>“Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong>Many Jews read it, because the place where he was crucified was close to the city.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>It was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>The chief priests said to Pilate, </strong><strong><em>“Don’t write ‘King of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am king of the Jews.’”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>Pilate answered,</strong><strong><em> “What I’ve written I’</em></strong><strong><em>ve written.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into fou</strong><strong>r sets, one for each soldier—</strong><strong>except for the tunic.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>It was seamless, woven from the top throughout.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><strong>They said, </strong><strong><em>“Let’s not tear it apart; cast lots for it”</em></strong><strong>—in </strong><strong>fulfillment of the s</strong><strong>cri</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>ture that said,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	“They divided my garments among them, </strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>and </strong><strong>cast lots for my clothes.”</strong> <strong>So that’s what the soldiers did.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>Beside Jesus’ cross stood his mother, the sister of his mother; Mary, wife of Clopas; and Mary </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Magdalene.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><strong>When he saw his mother and the disciple he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Your son.”</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><strong>Then he said to the disciple, </strong><strong><em>“Your mother</em></strong><strong><em>.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>From that time the disciple</strong><strong> took her to his home.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>Knowing that everything was done in fulfillment of the scripture, Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“I’m thirsty.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>A jar was sitting there full of sour wine.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>They put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it up to his mouth.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><strong>When he had taken the sour wine, he said, </strong><strong><em>“It’s done!”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>He dropped his head, and quit breathing.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>      </strong><strong> </strong></span>

### ebrewHebrew)) The Burial


<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>Because it was Preparation, the Jews asked Pilate to break their bones and take them away so the bodies wouldn’t be on the cross on the Sabbath.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(That Sabbath was a high day.)</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><strong>So the soldiers went and broke the bones of the first and the other man crucified with him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><strong>But when they came to Jesus and saw he was already dead, they didn’t break his bones.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><strong>But, one soldier pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water drained out immediately.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><strong>(The one that</strong><strong> has seen has borne witness;</strong><strong> his witness is tr</strong><strong>ue</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> he knows </strong><strong>he’</strong><strong>s telling the truth so you can believe</strong><strong> too</strong><strong>.)</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><strong>This </strong><strong>reminds us of </strong><strong>the scripture, </strong><strong><em>“Not </em></strong><strong><em>a </em></strong><strong><em>one of his bones</em></strong><strong><em> will be broken.”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><strong>Another scripture says, </strong><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>They’</em></strong><strong><em>ll look at the one they pierced.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesu</strong><strong>s—</strong><strong>but a s</strong><strong>ecret one for fear of the Jews—</strong><strong>asked Pilate for permission to take the body of Jesus, and Pilate granted it.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>He went and took his body away.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><strong>Nicodemus—who at the first came to Jesus at night—also came </strong><strong>with</strong><strong> some seventy pounds of myrrh mixed with aloes.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><strong>T</strong><strong>hey took the body and wound it in linen wrappings along with the aromatic spices, which is the Jews’ burial custom.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><strong>There was a garden near where he was crucified, and </strong><strong>there</strong><strong> was a new tomb </strong><strong>in it that </strong><strong>no one had been buried in.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><strong>That’s where they put Jesus</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> because it was the Jews’ Preparation and </strong><strong>the tomb was close by.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>      </strong></span>
