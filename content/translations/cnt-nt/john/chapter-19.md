## John Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. 2The soldiers twisted thorns together to make a crown and put it on his head. They put a purple robe on him 3and started coming up to him and saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and slapping him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Pilate brought him out again, "I'm bringing him out to let you know I don't find him guilty of anything." 5So he brought Jesus out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. "Look at the man!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When the chief priests and officers saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Pilate saidp, "You take him and crucify him. I don't find him guilty of anything."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The Jews answered, "According to our Law he should die because he's claimed to be God's Son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When Pilate heard that, he got more concerned. 9He went into the Praetorium and saidp to Jesus, "Where are you from?" 10"You're not going to talkp to me? You know, don't you, that I can release you or crucify you?" 11"You wouldn't have any authority over me if God hadn't let you have it. So the one that betrayed me to you has committed a worse sin."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Pilate tried to release him over that comment. But the Jews shouted, "If you release him, you're no friend of Caesar! Anybody that makes himself king is rebelling against Caesar!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When Pilate heard that, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgement seat at a place called The Pavement (Gabbatha in Hebrew). 14It was Preparation Day during Passover week, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Look, your 'king'!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They yelled, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then he delivered him over to be crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They took Jesus, and he went out carrying his own cross to The Place of the Skull ("Golgotha" in Hebrew). 18They crucified him along with two others, one on each side of him. 19-20Pilate wrote an inscription in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, and put it on the cross: "Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews." A lot of Jews read it because the place where they crucified him was close to the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The chief priests said to Pilate, "Don't write 'King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am King of the Jews.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Pilate answered, "What I've written I've written."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> After the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes four ways, one for each soldier—except for the tunic. It was seamless, woven from the top throughout. 24They said, "Let's not tear it apart; cast lots for it." So they did—fulfilling the scripture,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Beside Jesus' cross stood his mother, the sister of his mother; Mary, wife of Clopas; and Mary the Magdalene. 26When he saw his mother and the disciple he loved standing there, he saidp to his mother, "Your son." 27and to the disciple, "Your mother." From that time the disciple took her to his home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Since he knew they'd done everything that fulfilled the scripture, Jesus saidp, "I'm thirsty." 29A jar was sitting there full of sour wine. They put a sponge full of it on a hyssop branch and held it up to his mouth. 30When he'd taken it, he said, "It's done!" He dropped his head and quit breathing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Since it was Preparation Day, the Jews asked Pilate to break the legs of the crucified men and take their bodies away so they wouldn't be on the cross on a Sabbath. (That Sabbath was a high day.) 32So the soldiers broke the legs of the first and of the other man crucified with him. 33When they saw that Jesus was already dead, they didn't break his legs. 34One soldier thrust his spear into Jesus' side, and blood and water drained out immediately. 35(The one that watched it himself has submitted this report. He knows what he's telling you is true so you can believe it too.) 36That reminds us of the scripture, "Don't break any of its bones" [Ex 12:46; Num 9:12; (Ps 34:20)]. 37Another scripture says, "They'll look at the one they speared" [Zech 12:10].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> After that, Joseph of Arimathea—a disciple of Jesus secretly for fear of the Jews—asked Pilate to let him take Jesus' body, and Pilate granted it. He went and took his body away. 39Nicodemus—who at the first came to Jesus at night—also brought some 70 pounds of myrrh mixed with aloes. 40They wrapped his body in linen wrappings along with the aromatic spices, which is the Jews' burial custom. 41A garden close to where they crucified Jesus had a new, unused tomb in it. 42That's where they put Jesus because it was the Jews' Preparation Day.</span>
