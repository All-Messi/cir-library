## John Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The soldiers twisted thorns together to make a crown and put it on his head. They put a purple robe on him <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and started coming up to him and saying, <em>“Hail, K</em><em>ing of the Jews!” </em>and slapping him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Pilate brought him out again, <em>“I’m bringing him out to let you know I don’t find him guilty of anything.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So he brought Jesus out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. <em>“Look at the man!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When the chief priests and officers saw him, they shouted, <em>“Crucify him!</em><em> </em><em>Crucify him!”</em> Pilate said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> take him and crucify him.</em><em> </em><em>I don’t find him guilty of anything.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The Jews answered, <em>“A</em><em>ccording to </em><em>our L</em><em>aw he should die because he</em><em>’s claimed to be </em><em>God’s Son.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When Pilate heard that, he got more concerned. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He went into the Praetorium and said<sup>p</sup> to Jesus, <em>“Where are you from?”</em> Jesus didn’t answer him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 19:1</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Pilate tried to release him over that comment. But the Jews shouted, <em>“If you release him, you’re no friend of Caesar! </em><em>Anybody that makes himself king </em><em>is rebelling against Caesar!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When Pilate heard that, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgement seat at a place called The Pavement (Gabbatha in Hebrew). <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>It was Preparation <em>Day</em> during Passover <em>week</em>, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, <em>“</em><em>Look,</em><em> your </em><em>‘</em><em>king</em><em>’</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They yelled, <em>“Away with him!</em><em> </em><em>Away with him!</em><em> </em><em>Crucify him!”</em> <em>“You want me to crucify your </em><em>‘</em><em>king</em><em>’!</em><em>?”</em> The chief priests answered, <em>“We don’t have any king but Caesar.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then he delivered him over to be crucified.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jn </strong><strong>19:10-16</strong> <strong>The Way to Golgotha</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They took Jesus, and he went out carrying his own cross to The Place of the Skull (“Golgotha” in Hebrew). <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They crucified him along with two others, one on each side of him. <strong>Jn 19:17-18</strong> <strong>   </strong><strong>The Death of </strong><strong>Messiah</strong> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><strong><sup>-20</sup></strong>Pilate wrote an inscription in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, and put it on the cross: <em>“Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews.”</em><em> </em>A lot of Jews read it because the place where they crucified him was close to the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The chief priests said to Pilate, <em>“Don’t write ‘K</em><em>ing of the </em><em>Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am K</em><em>ing of the Jews.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Pilate answered,<em> “What I’ve written I’ve written.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>After the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes four ways, one for each soldier—except for the tunic. It was seamless, woven from the top throughout. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They said, <em>“Let’s not tear it apart;</em><em> </em><em>cast lots for it</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em>So they did—fulfilling the scripture, <strong><em>“They divided </em></strong><strong><em>up </em></strong><strong><em>my </em></strong><strong><em>garments</em></strong><strong><em> among them, </em></strong> <strong><em>	and cast lots for my clothes</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 22:18]</strong>.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 19:1</p>

### 9-24


<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Beside Jesus’ cross stood his mother, the sister of his mother; Mary, wife of Clopas; and Mary the Magdalene. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>When he saw his mother and the disciple he loved standing there, he said<sup>p</sup> to his mother<em>, “Your son.”</em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>and to the disciple, <em>“Your mother.”</em><em> </em>From that time the disciple took her to his home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Since he knew they’d done everything that fulfilled the scripture, Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“I’m thirsty.” </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong>A jar was sitting there full of sour wine. They put a sponge full of it on a hyssop branch and held it up to his mouth. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>When he’d taken it, he said, <em>“It’s done!”</em> He dropped his head and quit breathing.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jn 19:25</strong><strong>-30</strong> <strong>ebrewHebrew))</strong> <strong>The Burial</strong><strong> of Jesus</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Since it was Preparation <em>Day</em>, the Jews asked Pilate to break the legs of the crucified men and take <em>their bodies</em> away so they wouldn’t be on the cross on a Sabbath. (That Sabbath was a high day.) <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>So the soldiers broke the legs of the first and of the other man crucified with him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>When they saw that Jesus was already dead, they didn’t break his legs. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>One soldier thrust his spear into Jesus’ side, and blood and water drained out immediately. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>(The one that watched <em>it</em> <em>himself</em> has submitted this report. He knows what he’s telling you is true so you can believe <em>it </em>too.) <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>That reminds <em>us </em>of the scripture, <strong><em>“Don’t break a</em></strong><strong><em>ny</em></strong><strong><em> of it</em></strong><strong><em>s bones</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex 12:46;</strong><strong> Num 9:12; (Ps</strong><strong> 34:20</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>]</strong>. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Another scripture says, <strong><em>“They’ll look at the one they </em></strong><strong><em>speared</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Zech 12:10</strong><strong>]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> After that, Joseph of Arimathea—a disciple of Jesus secretly for fear of the Jews—asked Pilate to let him take Jesus’ body, and Pilate granted it. He went and took his body away. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Nicodemus—who at the first came to Jesus at night—also brought some 70 pounds of myrrh mixed with aloes. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>They wrapped his body in linen wrappings along with the aromatic spices, which is the Jews’ burial custom. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>A garden close to where they crucified Jesus had a new, unused tomb in it. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>That’s where they put Jesus because it was the Jews’ Preparation <em>Day</em>.<strong> </strong> <strong></span>
