## John Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus looked up to heaven, "Father, it's time. Honor your Son so he can honor you. 2You gave him the right to give eternal life to everybody you've given him. 3Eternal life means knowing you, the only true God, and Jesus the Messiah you sent. 4I've honored you on the earth and finished the work you gave me to do. 5Now, glorify me and yourself with the glory I had with you before the earth existed. 6"I've shown you to the ones you gave me out of the world, and they've kept your word. 7Now they know that the message I've given them came from you, 8They know that I really did come from you, and believe you sent me. 9I'm not asking about the world right now, but about the ones you gave me. 10My things are yours and yours are mine, and they've honored me. 11I'm not in the world anymore, but they are, and I'm coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name—which you've given me—so they can be one like we are. 12When I was with them, I kept them in your name, and none of them have perished except the one headed for destruction—to fulfill scripture. 13I'm saying these things so they can fully experience my joy. 14The world hates them because they're not like it. 15I'm not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. 16They're not like the world as I'm not. 17I've sanctified them with the truth—with your message. 18As you sent me into the world, I've sent them into it. 19I've sanctified myself for them so the truth can sanctify them. 20"Father, I'm not just asking that these be one, but that their converts also be one. 21That way the world will know you sent me. 22I've given them the honor you gave me so they can be one like we are—23so the world can know you love them like you love me. 24What you've given me I want to be with me where I am so they can see the honor you gave me because you loved me before the world existed. 25"Righteous Father, the world doesn't know you, but I know you, and these know you sent me. 26I'll continue to make you known to them so the love you loved me with can be in them like I am."</span>
