## John Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene camep to the tomb while it was still pretty dark and saw that the stone was rolled away from it. 2She ranp to Simon Peter and the disciple Jesus loved, "They've taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they put him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So Peter and the other disciple ran to the tomb. 4The other disciple outran Peter, 5stooped down and sawp the linen wrappings, but didn't go in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then Simon Peter gotp there and went on in and sawp the linen wrappings 7and the facecloth they'd put over his head. It wasn't with the linen wrappings; it was folded up by itself. 8Then the other disciple went in and looked and believed. 9They didn't yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead. 10So they went back to their quarters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Mary stood outside the tomb crying. While she was crying, she stooped down and looked inside the tomb. 12She sawp two angels in white, sitting at the head and foot of where Jesus' body had been.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They saidp, "Dear woman, why are you crying?" "They've taken my Lord, and I don't know where they've put him." 14When she'd said that, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but didn't recognize him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He saidp, "Why are you crying? Who are you looking for?" She thought he was the gardener, "Sir, if you've carried him off, tell me where you've put him, and I'll take him away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jesus saidp, "You don't need to hang onto me. I haven't gone up to the Father yet. Go tell my disciples I'm going up to my Father and yourspl, my God and yourspl."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Mary wentp and told them, "I've seen the Lord!" and what he'd told her to say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> That evening, the first day of the week, the disciples had locked the doors for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them, "Hello." 20He showed them his hands and side. They were excited to see him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He said again, "Peace to you. I'm sending you like the Father sent me." 22Then he blew on them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. 23The ones whose sins you forgive are forgiven; the ones whose sins you hold against them are held against them."	Jn 20: 19-23</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Thomas, one of the Twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came. The other disciples told him, "We've seen the Lord!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But Thomas said, "Unless I see the imprints from the spikes in his wrists and put my finger in them and put my hand in his side, I'm not believing it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> A week later, his disciples were behind locked doors again. Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Hello." 27He saidp to Thomas, "Look at my wrists; put your finger here. Put your hand in my side. Don't keep on not believing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Thomas answeredp, "My Lord and my God!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jesus saidp, "You believe because you've seen. They're blessed who believe and haven't seen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus did an endless number of signs in front of his disciples that I haven't recorded here. 31I've written these down so you'll believe he's the Messiah, God's Son, and have life by believing in him.     	 Jn 20: 24-31</span>
