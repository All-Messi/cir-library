## John Chapter 20

### The Resurrection of Messiah;  	The Report of the Women;   	The Visit of Peter and John

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came<sup>p</sup> to the tomb while it was still pretty dark and saw that the stone was rolled away from it. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She ran<sup>p</sup> to Simon Peter and the disciple Jesus loved, <em>“They’ve taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they put him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So Peter and the other disciple ran to the tomb. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The other disciple outran Peter, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>stooped down and saw<sup>p</sup> the linen wrappings, but didn’t go in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then Simon Peter got<sup>p</sup> there and went on in and saw<sup>p</sup> the linen wrappings <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and the facecloth they’d put over his head. It wasn’t with the linen wrappings; it was folded up by itself. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then the other disciple went in and looked and believed. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They didn’t yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>So they went back to their quarters.</span>

### Appearance to Mary the Magdalene


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Mary stood outside the tomb crying. While she was crying, she stooped down and looked inside the tomb. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>She saw<sup>p</sup> two angels in white, sitting at the head and foot of where Jesus’ body had been.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Dear woman</em><em>, why are you crying?” </em> <em>“They’ve taken my Lord, and I don</em><em>’t know where they’ve put him.” </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When she’d said that, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but didn’t recognize him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>W</em><em>hy are you crying?</em><em> </em><em>Who are you looking for?”</em> She thought he was the gardener, <em>“Sir, if you’ve carried him off, tell </em><em>me where you’ve put him, and I’</em><em>ll take him away.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“Mary.”</em> She turned around and said<sup>p</sup> in Aramaic,<em> “Rabboni (</em><em>Teacher</em><em>)!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“You don’t need to hang onto me. </em><em>I haven’t gone up to the Father yet.</em><em> </em><em>Go tell my disciples I’m going up to my Father and your</em><em>s</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>, my God and your</em><em>s</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Mary went<sup>p</sup> and told them, “<em>I’ve seen the Lord</em><em>!</em><em>” </em>and what he’d told her to say.</span>

### Appearance to the Ten


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> That evening, the first day of the week, the disciples had locked the doors for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them, <em>“</em><em>Hello</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He showed them his hands and side. They were excited to see him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He said again, <em>“Peace to you.</em><em> </em><em>I’m sending you </em><em>like the Father sent me.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Then he blew on them, <em>“Receive the Holy Spirit.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>The ones w</em><em>hose sins you forgive are forgiven; </em><em>the ones </em><em>whose sins you hold against them are held against them.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Jn 20: 19-23</strong> 	<strong>Appearance to the </strong><strong>Eleven</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Thomas, one of the Twelve, called Didymus, wasn’t with them when Jesus came. The other disciples told him, <em>“We’ve seen the Lord</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But Thomas said, <em>“Unless I </em><em>see the imprints from the spikes in his </em><em>wrists</em><em> and put my finger in them and put my hand in his side, I’m not </em><em>believing </em>it<em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> A week later, his disciples were behind locked doors again. Jesus came and stood among them and said, <em>“</em><em>Hello</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He said<sup>p</sup> to Thomas, <em>“Look at my </em><em>wrists;</em><em> put your finger here.</em><em> </em><em>Put you</em><em>r</em><em> hand in my side.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t keep </em><em>on not </em><em>believing.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Thomas answered<sup>p</sup>, <em>“My Lord and my God!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>You believe because you’ve seen. They’</em><em>re blessed who </em><em>believe and </em><em><u>haven’t</u></em><em> seen.”</em><em>	</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus did an endless number of signs in front of his disciples that I haven’t recorded here. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>I’ve written these down so you’ll believe he’s the Messiah, God’s Son, and have life by believing in him.     	 <strong>Jn 20: 24-31</strong> 	<strong>Appearance to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Seven</strong><strong> by </strong><strong>Lake </strong><strong>Galilee</strong><strong> </strong></span>
