## John Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Jesus was traveling around in Galilee. He didn't want to travel around in Judaea because the Jews were trying to kill him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The Jews' Festival of Unleavened Bread was coming up. 3Jesus' brothers told him, "Go to Judaea so your disciples can see what you're doing. 4Nobody does something privately when he's trying to get known publicly. If you're doing these things, show yourself to the world." (5Even his brothers didn't believe in him.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jesus toldp them, "It's not time for me to go yet. You can go anytime. 7The world can't hate you; it hates me because I speak to the fact that it does sinful things. 8You go on up; it's not time for me to go up to this festival yet."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He stayed in Galilee.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Jesus went up secretly. 11The Jews were looking for him at the festival, "Where is he?" 12A lot of murmuring was going on in the crowds. Some were saying, "He's a good man." Others said, "No, he's misleading the crowd." 13But, people wouldn't talk openly about him because they were afraid of the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> In the middle of the festival, Jesus did go up to the Temple and start teaching. 15The Jews were amazed, "How does he know letters without going to school?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jesus answered, "My teaching's not mine; it's the teaching of the One that sent me. 17If anybody wants to do his will, he'll know if my teaching is from God or if I'm speaking on my own. 18Somebody that speaks on his own is looking for his own honor. Somebody that's looking for the honor of the One that sent him is genuine; there's nothing dishonest about him. 19Didn't Moses give you the Law? But none of you keep it. Why are you trying to kill me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The crowd answered, "You've got a demon. Who's trying to kill you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus responded, "I did one thing, and it amazed you all. 22Moses gave you circumcision—not that it originated with him but with the ancestors—and you circumcise a man on a Sabbath. 23If you circumcise a man on a Sabbath to avoid breaking the Law, are you mad at me because I made a whole man well on a Sabbath? 24Don't make superficial judgments; base your judgments on what's real."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Some that lived in Jerusalem were saying, "Isn't this the One they're trying to put to death? 26And look, he's speaking openly, and they're not saying anything to him. Do the rulers know maybe that he is the Messiah?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then, as he was teaching, he shouted, "You know me, and you know where I'm from! I haven't come on my own; the One that's true sent me. You don't know him; 29but I do, because he sent me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They were trying to arrest him, but nobody laid a hand on him because it wasn't time yet. 31Many in the crowd believed in him, "When the Messiah comes, he won't do more signs than this man's done, will he?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring those things, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 33Jesus said, "I'll be with you for a little while yet; then I'll go back to the One that sent me. 34You'll look for me, but you won't find me. You can't go where I'm going."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The Jews said to each other, "Where's he going that we won't find him? He's not going to the Diaspora among the Greeks to teach the Greeks, is he? 36What does he mean, 'You'll look for me and won't find me,' and, 'You can't go where I'm going'?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> On the last day of the festival, the main day, Jesus stood and shouted, "If anybody's thirsty, come to me and drink. 38Everyone that believes in me, like the scripture has said, will have streams of living water flowing from within him." 39(He said that about the Spirit the ones who believed in him would receive. The Spirit hadn't come yet because Jesus hadn't been glorified.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Some in the crowd said, "This really is 'the prophet'"; some said, "He's 'the Messiah.'" 41Others said, "The Messiah's not supposed to come from Galilee, is he? 42Doesn't scripture say he descends from David and comes from Bethlehem, where David lived?" 43So a difference of opinion about him arose in the crowd. 44Some wanted to arrest him, but nobody laid a hand on him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> The officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees, "Why didn't you bring him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> The officers answered, "Nobody's ever spoken like that."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> The Pharisees answered them, "You haven't been deceived too, have you? 48None of the rulers or the Pharisees have believed in him, have they? 49This crowd that doesn't know the Law is accursed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Nicodemus saidp to them—the one who came to him at first, 51"It's not legal, is it, to convict someone without a hearing?" 52They answered him, "You're not from Galilee, too, are you? Search the Scriptures and see that no prophet is supposed to arise from Galilee." [[53Each one went home.]]ms [[</span>
