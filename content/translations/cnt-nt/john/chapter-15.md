## John Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I'm the true vine; my Father is the vinedresser. 2He cuts off every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit. He prunes every branch that does bear fruit so it'll bear more fruit. 3The message I've spoken to you has already pruned you. 4Stay in me and I in you. A branch can't bear fruit by itself; it has to stay connected to the vine; you can't either unless you stay in me. 5I'm the vine; you're the branches. If you stay in me and I in you, you'll bear lots of fruit. You can't bear any by yourselves. 6If you don't stay in me, you're cut off like a branch that dries up and people burn up. 7If you stay in me and what I say stays in you, ask whatever you want, and you'll receive it. 8This is what honors my Father: you becoming my disciples and bearing lots of fruit. 9I've loved you like the Father has loved me. Stay in my love. 10If you do what I tell you, you'll be staying in my love like I've done what my Father told me and stay in his love. 11"I've told you that so you can have the complete joy I have. 12This is my command: love one another like I've loved you. 13Nobody loves more than a person that lays down his life for his friends. 14You're my friends if you do what I tell you. 15I don't consider you servants anymore; servants don't know what their master's doing. I consider you friends because I tell you everything I've heard from my Father. 16You didn't choose me; I chose you and appointed you to bear fruit that lasts, so my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name. 17I'm commanding these things so you'll love one another. 18"If the world hates you, understand that it hated me first. 19If you were like the world, it would love its own kind. But because you're not like it, it hates you—but I've chosen you out of it. 20Remember that I told you servants are not better off than their master. If they persecuted me, they'll persecute you. If they kept my word, they'll keep yours. 21They'll do that to you because of me, because they don't know the One that sent me. 22"If I hadn't come and spoken to them, they wouldn't be guilty; but now they don't have any excuse for their sin. 23Whoever hates me hates my Father too. 24If I hadn't done among them what no one else has done, they wouldn't be guilty; but now they've seen and hated both me and my Father. 25What they've done fulfills what their Law says, 'They hated me for no reason' [Ps 35:19; 69:4]. 26"When the Helper comes that I'll send from the Father—the truth-revealing Spirit—he'll speak on my behalf. 27You will, too, because you've been with me since I began my ministry.</span>
