## John Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When Jesus found out that the Pharisees heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>(though Jesus didn’t perform the baptisms himself; his disciples did them), <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>he left Judaea and headed back to Galilee. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He had to go through Samaria. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He came<sup>p</sup> to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of land Jacob gave his son Joseph. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was sitting on the well <em>wall </em>about noon, tired from the trip.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A Samaritan woman came<sup>p</sup> to draw water, and he said to her, <em>“Give me a drink</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>(His disciples had gone into town to buy food.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The woman said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“How do</em><em>es </em><em>a Jewish man</em><em> ask a Samaritan woman for a drink</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Jews don’t </em><em>have anything to do</em><em> with Samaritans.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“If you knew God</em><em>’s gift</em><em> and who’s </em><em>ask</em><em>ing</em><em> you for</em><em> a drink, you</em><em>’d</em><em> be asking </em><em><u>him</u></em><em> to give </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> </em><em><u>living</u></em><em> water.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“Everyb</em><em>ody that drinks this water </em><em>get</em><em>s</em><em> thirsty again.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Whoever drinks the water I give him won’t get thirsty again.</em><em> </em><em>It</em><em>’ll become a well inside him that springs</em><em> up into eternal life.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Jesus told her<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Go </em><em>get</em><em> your husband and come back.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The woman said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Sir, </em><em>you must be</em><em> a prophet.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Our ances</em><em>tors worshiped on this mountain. Y</em><em>ou</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> say people </em><em>should</em><em> worship in Jerusalem.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus told<sup>p</sup> her, <em>“Believe me, the time’s coming when you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> won’t worship the Father on this mountain </em><em><u>or</u></em><em> in Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>You</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> don’t know what you’re worshiping.</em><em> </em><em>We </em><em>do</em><em>, because salvation does come from the Jews.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>But, the time’s coming—</em><em>i</em><em>t’</em><em>s here now—when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.</em><em> </em><em>The Father’s looking for people to worship him</em><em> like that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>God’s a spirit. and th</em><em>ose who </em><em>worship him need to worship him in spirit and truth.</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“I </em><em><u>am</u></em><em> the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>At that point his disciples got back and were surprised that he was talking to a woman. But nobody said, <em>“What are you trying to find out?”</em> <em>“Why are you talking to her?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>She left her water pot and went into town and told<sup>p</sup> the men, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“Come see a </em><em>fellow</em><em> that told me everything I ever did.</em><em> He’s not</em><em> the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, is </em><em>he</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They left the town and were on the way to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Meanwhile the disciples kept saying, <em>“Rabbi, eat something.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But he said, <em>“I have ‘food’ </em><em>to eat that </em><em>you don’t know about.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They said to one another, <em>“Nobody</em><em>’s</em><em> </em><em>brought him anything to eat, have</em><em> they?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“My ‘food’ is doing the will of the One that sent me and finishing it up.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Are</em><em>n’t you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> saying h</em><em>arvest is still </em><em>four</em><em> months away?</em><em> L</em><em>ook</em><em>; </em><em>the fields are ready for harvest now.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Whoever<em> reaps earns wages and gathers grain for eternal life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>In this respect, the saying hold</em><em>s true, ‘One sows</em><em>,</em><em> another reaps.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>I’ve sent you to reap what you haven’t worked on</em><em>. </em><em>Other people have worked, and you’ve joined in their work.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> From that town many Samaritans believed in him because the woman said, <em>“He told me everything I ever did.”</em> <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>So when the Samaritans got to where he was, they asked him to stay with them; he stayed two days. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>Many more believed because of what he said. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>They told the woman, <em>“We don’t believe </em><em>just</em><em> because of what you said.</em><em> </em><em>We’ve heard him ourselves and know this really is the </em><em>One that will save </em><em>the world.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Jn 4:1-42</strong> <strong>Introductory Statements About the Galilean Ministry</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Two days later, Jesus left for Galilee. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>He observed that a prophet doesn’t get any respect in his hometown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Yet when he got to Galilee, the Jews welcomed him because they’d seen what he’d done in Jerusalem; they’d attended the festival themselves.</span>

### Healing the Official’s Son


<span class="verse" id="v46"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then he went to Cana in Galilee, where he’d turned the water into wine. An official’s son in Capernaum was sick. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he went to ask him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Jesus told him, <em>“Unless you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> see signs, you won’t believe, will you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> The official said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Sir, come on down before </em><em>my little boy</em><em> dies.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Jesus told him<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Go on, your son</em><em>’s alive.”</em> The man took his word for it and went on back.</span>
