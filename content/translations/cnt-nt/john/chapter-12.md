## John Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>Six days before the Passover Jesus arrived at Bethany</strong><strong>, where Lazarus was that Jesus had raised from the dead</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>They made him a meal there.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Martha was waiting on him and Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>Mary took twelve </strong><strong>ou</strong><strong>nces of ointment—pure nard, very expensive—and poured it on Jesus’ feet and started wiping them with her hair</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The scent from the ointment filled the whole house</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><strong>But Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ disciples—the one that was going to betray him—said,</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><em>“Why wasn’t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>(He didn’t say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>He took care of the money pouch</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and had been stealing from what was put in it.)</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“Let her keep it for my burial.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><em>You always have the poor with you, but you don’t always have me.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><strong>A </strong><strong>great crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>They came, not just because of him, but also to see Lazarus, that he raised from the dead.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><strong>The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too, because many Jews were going away </strong><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><strong>because of him and believing in Jesus.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>  </strong></span>
