## John Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Six days before Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived that Jesus had raised from the dead. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They made him a meal there. Martha was waiting on him and Lazarus was reclining at table with him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Mary took twelve ounces of ointment—very expensive pure nard—and poured it on Jesus’ feet and started wiping them with her hair. The scent from the ointment filled the house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Judas Iscariot, Jesus’ disciple that would betray him, said<sup>p</sup>, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“Why didn’t she sell that</em><em> ointment for </em><em>300</em><em> </em><em>denarii [up to a year’s wages] </em><em>and give it to the poor?”</em> (<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He didn’t say that because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. He took care of the money pouch and had been stealing from it.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jesus said, <em>“Let her keep it for my burial.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>You always have poor </em><em>people around; you w</em><em>on’t always have</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> me</em><em> around</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A large crowd of the Jews found out that Jesus was there. They hadn’t come just because of him, but to see Lazarus. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus, too, because lots of Jews were <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>believing in Jesus because of him.	<strong>Jn </strong><strong>12:1</strong><strong>-1</strong><strong>1</strong> <strong>The Triumphal Entry</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The next day the huge crowd that attended the festival heard Jesus was coming into Jerusalem, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and took fronds from the palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, <strong><em>“‘Hosanna!</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	Blessed </em></strong><strong><em>be</em></strong><strong><em> the One that’</em></strong><strong><em>s coming in the name of the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>,’</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>  the King of Israel!</em><em>”</em> <strong>[Ps 118:25-</strong><strong>26]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it, like scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Some Greeks that went up to worship at the festival <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, <em>“Sir, we’d like to see Jesus.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Philip went<sup>p</sup> and spoke<sup>p</sup> to Andrew, and the two of them spoke<sup>p</sup> to Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus answered<sup>p</sup> them, <em>“</em><em>It’s time to honor</em><em> the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Unless a grain of wheat falls on</em><em> the ground and dies, </em><em>it’s alone. </em><em>But if it dies, it yields lot</em><em>s</em><em> of grain</em><em>s</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Those who</em><em> love</em><em> their</em><em> life will lose it</em><em>;</em><em> </em><em>those who</em><em> </em><em>look on past</em><em> </em><em>their</em><em> life in the world will keep it for eternal life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If </em><em>people</em><em> serve me, </em><em>they</em><em> need to follow me, and </em><em>they</em><em>’ll be where I am.</em><em> </em><em>If </em><em>they</em><em> serve me, the Father will honor </em><em>the</em><em>m.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The crowd standing there heard it and said it had thundered. Others said, <em>“An angel </em><em>spoke</em><em> to him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Jesus responded, <em>“That</em><em> voice didn’t come </em><em>for my sake so much as</em><em> for yours.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>Now judgment is in th</em><em>e</em><em> world; the ruler of this world will be thrown out.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>And i</em><em>f I’m lifted up from the ground, I’ll draw every</em><em>one</em><em> to me.”</em> <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>(He said that to indicate how he’d die.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The crowd responded, <em>“We’ve heard out of the L</em><em>aw that </em><em>Messiah will</em><em> </em><em>remain</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> forever.</em><em> </em><em>How do you say the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> has to be lifted up?</em><em> </em><em>Who is this ‘</em><em>Son of Man</em><em>’?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus said, <em>“The light’s still among you for a little while.</em><em> </em><em>Walk while you have </em><em>it</em><em> so darkness doesn’t overtake you.</em><em> People that </em><em>walk in the dark can’t tell where </em><em>they’re</em><em> going.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>While you have light, believe in it so </em><em>it will enlighten you</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>After saying that, Jesus went away and was hidden <em>from them</em>. 	<strong>Jn </strong><strong>12:</strong><strong>28b-36</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Despite doing so many signs in their presence, they weren’t believing in him—<strong><sup>38</sup></strong>just like Isaiah the prophet said, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>, who has believed our report, and </em></strong> <strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>	w</em></strong><strong><em>ho has the arm of the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> been revealed to?”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 53:1]</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Here’s the reason they couldn’t believe: Isaiah said again,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Isaiah said that because he saw the Messiah’s glory and spoke about him. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>Nevertheless a number even of the rulers did believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn’t admit it and get excommunicated from the synagogue. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>They cared more about honor from people than glory from God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Jesus shouted, <em>“Whoever believes in me doesn’t</em> just<em> </em><em>believe in me, but in the One that sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>Whoever sees me sees the One that sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> come </em><em>to the world as a light so nobody that believes in me will be in the dark.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>I don’t condemn</em><em> </em><em>anybody </em><em>that</em><em> hear</em><em>s what I’m saying and doesn’t do it. </em><em>I didn’t come to condemn the world, but to save it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>People that</em><em> reject me </em><em>do have</em><em> something that</em><em> will</em><em> condemn</em><em> them in the end: the message I’m delivering</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>I haven’t spoken on my own.</em><em> </em><em>The Father </em><em>has told</em><em> me what to say.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>I know </em><em>that what he says</em><em> leads to eternal life; so I say what he</em><em>’s</em><em> told me to say.”</em><em>	</em> <strong>Jn 12:</strong><strong>37</strong><strong>-50</strong> <strong>Jesus Washes the Disciples’ Feet</strong></span>
