## John Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>As he was walking along, he saw a man that had been blind from birth. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>His disciples asked him, <em>“Rabbi, who sinned, </em><em>him</em><em> or his parents, that </em><em>caused him to be</em><em> born blind?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When he’d said that, he spit on the ground and made some mud and smeared it on the blind man’s eyelids, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Go was</em><em>h it off in the Pool of Siloam (‘</em><em>Sent</em><em>’</em><em>)</em><em>.”</em> He went and washed it off and came back able to see. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Neighbors and people that had seen him begging said, <em>“I</em><em>sn’t that</em><em> the </em><em>fellow</em><em> that sits and begs?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They took<sup>p</sup> him to the Pharisees. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>It was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and gave him sight. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The Pharisees, too, asked him how he’d received his sight. He told them, <em>“He put mud on my eye</em><em>lid</em><em>s.</em><em> </em><em>I washed it off and I c</em><em>an</em><em> see.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Some Pharisees said, <em>“That</em><em> man</em><em>’</em><em>s not</em><em> from God; he doesn’t keep Sabbath</em><em>.”</em> Others said, <em>“How c</em><em>ould</em><em> a man </em><em>that’s a sinner </em><em>do such a thing?”</em> So they were divided over it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They said<sup>p</sup> to the blind man again, <em>“You’re the one he made see.</em><em> </em><em>What do </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> think about him?”</em> <em>“He’s a prophet.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The Jews doubted that he’d been blind till they called his parents, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“Is this your son that you </em><em>claim</em><em> was blind?</em><em> </em><em>How </em><em>can he</em><em> see now?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They called the man a second time, <em>“Give </em><em><u>God</u></em><em> the credit; we know that</em><em> man’s a sinner.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He responded, <em>“I don’t know if he’s a sinner.</em><em> </em><em>I do know</em><em> one thing</em><em>:</em><em> </em><em>I was blind; now I can see.”</em><em>	 </em><strong>Jn 9:13</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>25</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They said, <em>“What did he do to you?</em><em> </em><em>How did he make you able to see?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus heard they’d excommunicated him. When he found him, he said, <em>“Do you believe in the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“I came </em><em>to the world</em><em> to render judgment</em><em> so the ones that can’t see </em><em>can</em><em> see</em><em>,</em><em> and the ones that</em><em> can</em><em> see </em><em>can</em><em> </em><em>go</em><em> blind.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The Pharisees that were with him heard it, <em>“We aren’t blind too, are we?”</em></span>
