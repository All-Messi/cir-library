## John Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> As he was walking along, he saw a man that had been blind from birth. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>His disciples asked him, <em>“Rabbi, who sinned, </em><em>him</em><em> or his parents, that </em><em>caused him to be</em><em> born blind?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <em>“Neither he nor his parents sinned </em>to cause his blindness<em>. That has happened so I could demonstrate God’s work</em><em> in him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>We need to work for the One that</em><em> sent me while it’s daylight. N</em><em>ight</em><em>’s</em><em> coming when nobody can work.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>While I’m in the world, I’m the light of</em><em> it</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When he’d said that, he spit on the ground and made some mud and smeared it on the blind man’s eyelids, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Go was</em><em>h it off in the Pool of Siloam (‘</em><em>Sent</em><em>’</em><em>)</em><em>.”</em> He went and washed it off and came back able to see. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Neighbors and people that had seen him begging said, <em>“I</em><em>sn’t that</em><em> the </em><em>fellow</em><em> that sits and begs?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“It </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> him.”</em> <em>“No, he just looks like him.”</em> <em>“It </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“How did you get your sight?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>“The man they call</em><em> Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eye</em><em>lid</em><em>s and </em><em>told me to</em><em> </em><em>g</em><em>o to Siloam and wash it off.</em><em> </em><em>So I </em><em>did,</em><em> and I </em><em>could</em><em> see.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“Where is he?”</em> <em>“I don’t know.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 9:1-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They took<sup>p</sup> him to the Pharisees. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>It was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and gave him sight. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The Pharisees, too, asked him how he’d received his sight. He told them, <em>“He put mud on my eye</em><em>lid</em><em>s.</em><em> </em><em>I washed it off and I c</em><em>an</em><em> see.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Some Pharisees said, <em>“That</em><em> man</em><em>’</em><em>s not</em><em> from God; he doesn’t keep Sabbath</em><em>.”</em> Others said, <em>“How c</em><em>ould</em><em> a man </em><em>that’s a sinner </em><em>do such a thing?”</em> So they were divided over it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They said<sup>p</sup> to the blind man again, <em>“You’re the one he made see.</em><em> </em><em>What do </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> think about him?”</em> <em>“He’s a prophet.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The Jews doubted that he’d been blind till they called his parents, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“Is this your son that you </em><em>claim</em><em> was blind?</em><em> </em><em>How </em><em>can he</em><em> see now?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <em>“He’s our son, and </em><em>he was </em><em>born </em><em>blind.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>We don’t know how he</em><em> can </em><em>see now or w</em><em>ho gave him his sight. Ask him; he’s </em><em>legal age; he can speak for himself.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>(They said that because they were afraid. The Jews had already agreed to excommunicate from the synagogue anybody who agreed that Jesus was the Messiah. [<strong><sup>23</sup></strong>]<sup>repeat</sup>)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They called the man a second time, <em>“Give </em><em><u>God</u></em><em> the credit; we know that</em><em> man’s a sinner.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He responded, <em>“I don’t know if he’s a sinner.</em><em> </em><em>I do know</em><em> one thing</em><em>:</em><em> </em><em>I was blind; now I can see.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 9:13-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They said, <em>“What did he do to you?</em><em> </em><em>How did he make you able to see?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> <em>“I already told you and you didn’t listen.</em><em> </em><em>Why do you want to hear it again?</em><em> </em><em>You don’t want to become his disciples too, do you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> <em>“You’re </em><em><u>his</u></em><em> disciple; we’re </em><em><u>Moses’</u></em><em> disciples.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>We know God spoke to </em><em>Moses</em><em>, but we don’t know where this man’s from.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <em>“It’s</em><em> amazing that you don’t know where he’s from</em><em>:</em><em> he gave me my sight.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>We know God doesn’t </em><em>listen to</em><em> sinners, but if anybody is devout and does his will, he </em><em>listens to</em><em> </em><em><u>him</u></em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>From</em><em> </em><em>eternity</em><em> </em><em>past </em><em>nobody ever heard of some</em><em>one</em><em> giving sight to a man born blind.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>If he</em><em> weren’t from God, he couldn’t </em><em>have done anything</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> <em>“You were </em><em>totally</em><em> born in sins, and you’re trying to teach us?”</em> They excommunicated him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jn 9:26-34</p>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus heard they’d excommunicated him. When he found him, he said, <em>“Do you believe in the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> <em>“Who is he so I can believe in him?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> <em>“You’ve seen him</em><em>;</em><em> he’s the </em><em>O</em><em>ne talking to you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> “<em>I believe, Lord,”</em> and knelt down to him.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	          </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Jesus said, <em>“I came </em><em>to the world</em><em> to render judgment</em><em> so the ones that can’t see </em><em>can</em><em> see</em><em>,</em><em> and the ones that</em><em> can</em><em> see </em><em>can</em><em> </em><em>go</em><em> blind.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The Pharisees that were with him heard it, <em>“We aren’t blind too, are we?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> <em>“If you were blind, you wouldn’t be guilty.</em><em> But you say, ‘We can see.’ You’re still</em><em> guilt</em><em>y.</em><em>”</em></span>
