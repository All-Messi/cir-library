## John Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> As he was walking along, he saw a man that had been blind from birth. 2His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, him or his parents, that caused him to be born blind?" 3"Neither he nor his parents sinned to cause his blindness. That has happened so I could demonstrate God's work in him. 4We need to work for the One that sent me while it's daylight. Night's coming when nobody can work. 5While I'm in the world, I'm the light of it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When he'd said that, he spit on the ground and made some mud and smeared it on the blind man's eyelids, 7"Go wash it off in the Pool of Siloam ('Sent')." He went and washed it off and came back able to see. 8Neighbors and people that had seen him begging said, "Isn't that the fellow that sits and begs?" 11"The man they call Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyelids and told me to go to Siloam and wash it off. So I did, and I could see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They tookp him to the Pharisees. 14It was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and gave him sight. 15The Pharisees, too, asked him how he'd received his sight. He told them, "He put mud on my eyelids. I washed it off and I can see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Some Pharisees said, "That man's not from God; he doesn't keep Sabbath." Others said, "How could a man that's a sinner do such a thing?" So they were divided over it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They saidp to the blind man again, "You're the one he made see. What do you think about him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The Jews doubted that he'd been blind till they called his parents, 19"Is this your son that you claim was blind? How can he see now?" 20"He's our son, and he was born blind. 21We don't know how he can see now or who gave him his sight. Ask him; he's legal age; he can speak for himself." 22(They said that because they were afraid. The Jews had already agreed to excommunicate from the synagogue anybody who agreed that Jesus was the Messiah. [23]repeat)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They called the man a second time, "Give God the credit; we know that man's a sinner."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He responded, "I don't know if he's a sinner. I do know one thing: I was blind; now I can see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They said, "What did he do to you? How did he make you able to see?" 27"I already told you and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples too, do you?" 28"You're his disciple; we're Moses' disciples. 29We know God spoke to Moses, but we don't know where this man's from." 30"It's amazing that you don't know where he's from: he gave me my sight. 31We know God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anybody is devout and does his will, he listens to him. 32From eternity past nobody ever heard of someone giving sight to a man born blind. 33If he weren't from God, he couldn't have done anything." 34"You were totally born in sins, and you're trying to teach us?" They excommunicated him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus heard they'd excommunicated him. When he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Jesus said, "I came to the world to render judgment so the ones that can't see can see, and the ones that can see can go blind."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The Pharisees that were with him heard it, "We aren't blind too, are we?" 41"If you were blind, you wouldn't be guilty. But you say, 'We can see.' You're still guilty."</span>
