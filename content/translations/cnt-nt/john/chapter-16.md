## John Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've told you that, so you won't get caught off guard. 2They'll excommunicate you from the synagogues, but—more than that—the time's coming when anybody that kills you will think they're serving God. 3That's because they don't know the Father or me. 4So when it happens, remember that I told you it would. "I didn't tell you those things at first because I was with you. 5But now I'm going to the One that sent me, and you don't need to ask where I'm going. 6Because I've told you that, you feel sad. 7But it's to your benefit that I go away because the Helper wouldn't be coming to you. If I go, I'll send him. 8When he comes, he'll convict the world of sin and goodness and judgment—9of sin because they don't believe in me; 10of goodness because I'm going to the Father and you won't see me anymore; 11and of judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged. 12"I still have so much to tell you, but you can't deal with it now. 13But when the truth-revealing Spirit comes, he'll lead you in all truth. He won't speak on his own; he'll tell you what he's heard and what's going to happen. 14He'll honor me because he'll take from me and tell you. 15Everything the Father has is mine. That's why I've said the Spirit will take from me and tell you. 16"In a little while you won't see me; and a little while after that you'll see me again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Some disciples said to one another, "What's this, 'In a little while you won't see me; in a little while you'll see me again'; and 'because I'm going to the Father'? 18What's this 'little while' mean? We don't understand it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jesus knew they wanted to ask him, "Are you talking about what I said, 'In a little while, you won't see me; in a little while, you'll see me again'? 20You'll mourn, but the world will be happy. You'll grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. 21When a woman's in labor, she has grief; but when she has the child, she doesn't think about the anguish anymore because of the joy of bringing a person into the world. 22You'llp grieve now, but I'll see you again, and you'll be happy. Nobody will takep your happiness away. 23At that time you won't be asking me for anything. Whatever you ask the Father for in my name now he'll give you. 24Up till now you haven't asked for anything in my name. Ask and you'll receive so you'll be completely happy. 25"I've been using illustrations. The time's coming when I'll speak plainly about the Father. 26Then you'll ask in my name; and, rest assured, I'll ask the Father for you. 27The Father himself loves you because you love me and believe I came from him. 28I did come from him to the world. Again, I'm leaving the world and going back to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The disciples saidp, "Now you're speaking clearly. 30Now we know that you know everything and don't need anybody to ask you. That's why we believe you've come from God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Jesus responded, "Do you? 32The time's coming—it's almost here—when you'll all scatter and leave me alone. But I'm not alone, because the Father's with me. 33I've told you these things so you'll have peace. In the world you have trouble, but take heart, I've overcome the world."</span>
