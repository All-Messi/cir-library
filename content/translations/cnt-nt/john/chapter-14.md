## John Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Don't worry. You believe in God; believe in me too. 2There are many rooms in my Father's house. If that weren't so, I would've told you, because I'm going to get a place ready for you. 3When I've done that, I'll come backp to get you so you can be with me. 4You know how to get to where I'm going."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Thomas saidp, "We don't know where you're going. How can we know how to get there?" 6"I'm the way, truth, and life. No one gets to the Father except through me. 7If you've come to know me, you'll know my Father too. From now on you know him and have seen him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Philip saidh[, "Lord, show us the Father; that'll be enough." 9"Have I been with youpl all this time, Philip, and yousg haven't seen me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can yousg say, 'Show us the Father'? 10Don't yousg believe I'm in the Father and the Father's in me? What I say I'm not saying on my own, but the Father that's in me is working through me. 11Believepl that I'm in the Father and the Father's in me. If not, believepl because of the things I do. 12Whoever believes in me will do what I do and more because I'm going to the Father. 13I'll do whatever you ask in my name so I can praise the Father. 14I repeat, if you ask anything in my name, I'll do it. 15"If you love me, you'll do what I tell you. 16I'll ask the Father to give you another Helper to be with you permanently. 17He's the truth-revealing Spirit that the world can't receive because they don't see him or know him. But you know him because he stays with you and will be in you. 18I won't leave you as orphans; I'll come to you. 19In a little while, the world won't see me, but you'll see me. You'll be living because I'll be living. 20Then you'll know I'm in the Father and you're in me and I'm in you. 21The ones that love me are the ones that have my commands and keep them. My Father will love the ones that love me, and I'll love them and show myself to them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Judas (not Iscariot) saidp, "Lord, what's happened that you're going to show yourself to us, but not to the world?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus answered, "If people love me, they'll follow what I say, and my Father will love them. We'll come and make our home in them. 24People that don't love me, don't follow what I say. The message you hear is not mine, but the Father's. 25"I've said this while I'm with you. 26The Helper—the Holy Spirit the Father will send in my name—will teach you everything and remind you of what I've told you. 27I'm leaving my peace with you, not the kind the world gives. Don't worry or be afraid. 28You heard me say I'm going away, but I'll come back to you. If you loved me, you'd be happy that I'm going to the Father because the Father is greater than I am. 29"I've told you now before it happens so when it does, you'll believe. 30Lots of things I'm not going to tell you now because the ruler of this world is on his way, and he doesn't have anything to do with me. 31But I'm doing what the Father told me to do so the world can know I love him.</span>
