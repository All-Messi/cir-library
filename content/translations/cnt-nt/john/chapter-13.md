## John Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Before the Passover Festival, Jesus knew the time had come for him to go to the Father. He loved his own that were in the world and loved them to the end. 2During the supper, the devil had already prompted Judas, Simon Iscariot's son, to betray him. 3Jesus knew the Father had turned everything over to him. 4He gotp up from supper, laidp his outer clothes aside, and took a towel and hung it over his shoulder. 5He putp some water in a basin and started washing his disciples' feet and drying them with the towel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When he camep to Simon Peter, Peter saidp, "Lord, you're going to wash my feet?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jesus answered, "You don't understand right now what I'm doing, but you will in a little bit."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Peter saidp, "Don't you ever wash my feet!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Simon Peter saidp, "Lord, don't wash just my feet, but my hands and head too."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus saidp, "Someone that's taken a bath doesn't need to wash anything but his feet. He's clean everywhere else. You'repl clean, but not all of you." 11(He knew who would betray him; that's why he said, "Youpl are not all clean.")</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When he'd washed their feet and put his outer clothes back on, he sat down again, "Do you understand what I've done? 13You call me 'Rabbi' and 'Lord,' and rightly so. 14If I—'Lord' and 'Rabbi'—washed your feet, then you should wash each other's feet. 15I've given you an example to do like I've done to you. 16A servant has it no better than his master; a messenger has it no better than the one that sent him. 17If you understand that, you're blessed if you act that way. 18I'm not talking about all of you. I know who I've chosen, but like the scripture says:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> From now on, I'll tell you before things happen so when they do, you'll believe who I am. 20Whoever receives somebody I send, receives me, and whoever receives me receives the One that sent me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> After he said that, he began to feel deeply distressed, "One of you is going to betray me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The disciples looked at one another at a loss who he meant. 23One disciple was reclining at table in front of Jesus—one that Jesus loved. 24Simon Peter motioned to him to find out who Jesus meant. 25So he leaned back on Jesus and saidp, "Lord, who is it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus answeredp, "The one I dip the piece of bread and give it to." He dipped it and handedp it to Judas. 27After the piece of bread, Satan entered Judas. Jesus saidp, "Do what you're goingp to do." 28Nobody at the table knew why he spoke to him. 29Since Judas had the money pouch, some supposed Jesus meant to go buy something we needed for the festival or to give something to the poor. 30He took the piece of bread and went out immediately. It was dark.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> When Judas had gone out, Jesus saidp, "Now God will glorify the Son of Man, and the Son of Man will glorify him, 32and God will glorify him soon. 33Little children, I'll be with you a little while yet. You'll look for me and, like I told the Jews, 'You can't go where I'm going'; now I'm telling you. 34I'm commanding you something new: love one another like I've loved you. 35If you love one another, people can tell you're my disciples."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Simon Peter saidp, "Where are you going, Lord?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Peter saidp, "Why can't I follow you now? I'll lay down my life for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Jesus answered, "Will you? Truth is, before a rooster crows, you're going to deny three times that you know me."</span>
