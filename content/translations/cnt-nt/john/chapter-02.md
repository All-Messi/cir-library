## John Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Three days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, 2and he and his disciples were invited. 3When the wine ran out, his mother toldp him they'd run out of wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus saidp, "What is this? It's not my time yet."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> His mother toldp the help, "Do whatever he tells you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Six big stone water jars were standing there that the Jews use for purification. They held 20 or 30 gallons apiece. 7Jesus saidp, "Fill the jars with water." They filled them to the brim. 8"Dip some out and take it to the master of ceremonies." 9When he tasted it, he didn't know where it had come from—but the help that drew the water knew. He called the groom, 10"Everybody serves good wine first. When guests have had a lot to drink, they serve wine that's not as good. You've kept the good wine till now." 11So Cana was where Jesus performed his first sign and demonstrated his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> After that, he went down to Capernaum for a few days with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Jews' Passover was coming, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14In the Temple he found moneychangers sitting and merchants selling oxen, sheep, and doves. 15He made a whip out of cords and drove the sheep and oxen out of the Temple. He poured out the moneychangers' coins and turned their tables over. 16He told the ones that were selling doves, "Get them out of here! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace." 17His disciples remembered the scripture, "Zeal for your house has consumed me" [Ps 69:9a].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The Jews said, "What sign do you do to show us you have a right to do this?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jesus answered, "Destroypl this Temple, and I'll rebuild it in 3 days." 20"It took 46 years to build; you're going to rebuild it in 3 days?" 21(He was talking about his body, "the Temple." 22When he resurrected, his disciples remembered he'd said that and believed it and the scripture.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, many believed in him because they saw the signs he did. 24But he didn't entrust himself to them because he knew everybody. 25He didn't need anybody to tell him about anyone; he knew what each person was like.</span>
