## John Chapter 2

### The First Miracle—at Cana

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Three days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and he and his disciples were invited. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When the wine ran out, his mother told<sup>p</sup> him they’d run out of wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“What is this</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>It’s not my time yet.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> His mother told<sup>p</sup> the help, <em>“Do whatever he tells you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Six big stone water jars were standing there that the Jews use for purification. They held 20 or 30 gallons apiece. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Fill the jars with water.</em><em>”</em> They filled them to the brim. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Dip some out</em><em> and take</em><em> it to the master of ceremonies.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When he tasted it, he didn’t know where it had come from—but the help that drew the water knew. He called the groom,<em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“Everybody serves good wine first.</em><em> </em><em>When </em><em>guests</em><em> have</em><em> had a lot to drink</em><em>, they serve wine that’s not as good.</em><em> </em><em>You’ve kept the good wine till now.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So Cana was where Jesus performed his first sign and demonstrated his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</span>

### The First Cleansing of the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Jews’ Passover was coming, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>In the Temple he found moneychangers sitting and merchants selling oxen, sheep, and doves. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He made a whip out of cords and drove the sheep and oxen out of the Temple. He poured out the moneychangers’ coins and turned their tables over. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He told the ones that were selling doves, <em>“Get them out of here! D</em><em>on’t make my Father’s house a </em><em>market</em><em>place.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>His disciples remembered the scripture,<em> </em><strong><em>“Zeal for your house has consumed me</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Ps 69:9a</strong><strong>]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The Jews said, <em>“What </em><em>sign do you do to show us you have a</em><em> right to do this?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“Destroy</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> this </em><em>Temple</em><em>, and I’ll </em><em>rebuild it</em><em> in </em><em>3</em><em> days.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <em>“It took </em><em>46</em><em> years to build</em><em>;</em><em> you’re going to </em><em>rebuild it</em><em> in </em><em>3</em><em> days?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>(He was talking about his body, “the Temple.” <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When he resurrected, his disciples remembered he’d said that and believed it and the scripture.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, many believed in him because they saw the signs he did. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But he didn’t entrust himself to them because he knew everybody. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He didn’t need anybody to tell him about anyone; he knew what each person was like.</span>
