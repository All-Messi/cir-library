## John Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>Three </strong><strong>days later there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Jesus’ mother was there, </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>and Jesus and his disciples were invited.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, </strong><strong><em>“They don’t have any more wine.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“What’s between </em></strong><strong><em>you and me</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>It’s not my time yet.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>His mother told the help, </strong><strong><em>“Do whatever he tells you.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><strong>Now six large stone water pots </strong><strong>were </strong><strong>standing there, used for purification by the Jews, holding twenty or thirty gallons apiece.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“Fill the pots with water,”</em></strong><strong> and they filled them to the brim.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><em>“Dip some out now, and take</em></strong><strong><em> it to the master of ceremonies.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>When the master of ceremonies tasted the water turned to wine, he didn’t know where it came from—but the help that drew the water knew.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>He</strong><strong> called the groom,</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><strong>“Everybody serves good wine first.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>When people have drunk freely, they serve wine that’s not as good.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>You’ve kept the good wine till now.”</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><strong>So Cana was where Jesus performed his first sign and demonstrated his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>    </strong><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	         </strong><strong>Jn </strong><strong>2:1-11</strong></span>
