## John Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>In the beginning the Word was there.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The Word was with God</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and the Word was deity.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>He was in the beginning with God.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>He made everything; nothing was made without him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>He had life in himself, and the life was light for mankind.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>The light shined in the dark</strong><strong>ness</strong><strong>, but the darkness did not accept it.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>God sent a man named John </strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>to testify about the light so everybody would believe through him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>He wasn’t the light, but came to testify about </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>the true light that enlightens every person by coming into the world.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><strong>He was in the world and made</strong><strong> the world, but the world didn’</strong><strong>t know him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><strong>He came into his own things, but his own people did not accept him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><strong>But, to as many as did accept him he gave the right to become God’s children—the ones that </strong><strong>trust</strong><strong> in him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><strong>They were not born from the will of a husband, from physical drives, or from blood, but from God.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>The Word took on a physical nature and lived among us for a while, and we saw </strong><strong>his glory, glory like the only O</strong><strong>ne begotten by the Father, full of grace and truth.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>John shouted, </strong><strong><em>“This is the One I meant when I said, ‘One coming after me has come to be before me, because he was before me.’”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><strong>From his full supply we have all received grace upon grace.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><strong>Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Messiah.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><strong>Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten deity—the One dear to the Father—has shone wh</strong><strong>at he’s like.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>    </strong><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>    </strong><strong> </strong><strong>     </strong></span>
