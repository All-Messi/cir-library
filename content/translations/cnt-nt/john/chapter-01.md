## John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the beginning the Word was there. The Word was with God, and the Word was deity. 2He was in the beginning with God. 3He made everything; nothing came into existence without him. What has come 4in him was life, life that gave people light. 5The light shinedp in the darkness, but the darkness tended not to accept it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> God sent a man named John 7to tell about the light so everybody would believe. 8He wasn't the light, but came to reveal 9it, the true light for enlightening everyone in the world. 10The Word was in the world and made the world, but it didn't know him. 11He came into his own things, but his own people tended not to accept him. 12But, to as many as did accept and believe in him, he gave the right to become God's offspring, 13not born by blood, physical desire, or a husband's will, but by God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The Word took on a physical nature and lived with us. We saw his glory, glory like the only One from the Father, full of grace and reality.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> John testifiedp about him, shouting, "He's the One I was talking about when I said, 'After me a man is coming that has become before me because he existed before me!'" 16From his full measure we've all received grace on top of grace. 17Moses gave law, but Jesus the Messiah brought grace and reality. 18Nobody's ever seen God, but the unique deity—the One dear to the Father—has shown what he's like.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> This is what John said when Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. 22"Who are you, so we can answer the ones that sent us? What do you say about yourself?" 23"I'm one shouting in the desert, 'Make the LORD's road straight!' [Is 40:3] like Isaiah the prophet said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The Pharisees had sent the ones that came. 25They asked him, "Why are you baptizing if you're not the Messiah, Elijah, or 'the prophet'?" 26"I'm baptizing in water, but there's a man you don't know standing among you. 27He'll succeed me, a man whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to unfasten."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan River, where John was baptizing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The next day he sawp Jesus coming, "Look, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world! 30He's the One I was talking about when I said, 'After me a man is coming that has become before me because he existed before me.' 31I didn't know who he was; but to point him out to Israel, I came immersing in water. 32I've seen the Spirit coming down from the sky like a dove and remaining on him. 33The One that sent me to immerse people in water told me, 'Whoever you see the Spirit coming down and remaining on is the One that will 'immerse' them in the Holy Spirit.' 34I've seen that, and I'm telling you, this is God's Son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The next day John was standing with a couple disciples. 36When he saw Jesus walk by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!" 37His two disciples followed Jesus. 38Jesus turned around and saw them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two that followed Jesus. 41The first thing Andrew did was gop and findp his brother Simon, "We've found the Messiah (the Christ)." 42When he brought him to Jesus, Jesus looked at him, "You're Simon Barjonah; you'll be called Cephas (Peter)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> The next day Jesus wanted to leave for Galilee. He foundp Philip, "Come with me." 44Philip was from Bethsaida, where Andrew and Peter lived. 45Philip foundp Nathanael, "We've found the One that Moses and the Prophets wrote about in the Law: Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Nathanael said, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Jesus saw Nathanael coming, "A true Israelite with no deceit in him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Nathanael saidp, "Where do you know me from?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Nathanael answered, "Rabbi, you're the Son of God, the king of Israel!" 50"You believe because I said I saw you under the fig tree? You're going to see greater things than that. 51You'll see the sky opened up and God's angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</span>
