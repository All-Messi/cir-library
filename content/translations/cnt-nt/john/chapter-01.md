## John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>In the beginning the Word was <em>there</em>. The Word was with God, and the Word was <u>deity</u>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He was in the beginning with God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He made everything; nothing came into existence without him. What has come <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>in him was life, life that gave people light. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The light shined<sup>p</sup> in the darkness, but the darkness tended not to accept it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>God sent a man named John <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>to tell about the light so everybody would believe. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He wasn’t the light, but came to reveal <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>it, the true light for enlightening everyone in the world. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The</em> <em>Word</em> was in the world and made the world, but it didn’t know him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He came into his own things, but his own people tended not to accept him. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But, to as many as did accept and believe in him, he gave the right to become God’s offspring, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>not born by blood, physical desire, or a husband’s will, but by God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The Word took on a physical nature and lived with us. We saw his glory, glory like the only One from the Father, full of grace and reality.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> John testified<sup>p</sup> about him, shouting, <em>“</em><em>He’</em><em>s the One I </em><em>was talking about when I said, ‘After me a man is coming that</em><em> </em><em>has become before me</em><em> because he </em><em>existed</em><em> before </em><em>me!</em><em>’”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>From his full measure we’ve all received grace on top of grace. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Moses gave law, but Jesus the Messiah brought grace and reality. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Nobody’s ever seen God, <em>but</em> the unique deity—the One dear to the Father—has shown what he’s like.</span>

### John’s Defense of His Ministry


<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>This is what John said when Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The Pharisees had sent the ones that came. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>They asked him<em>, “Why are you baptizing if you’re not the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, Elijah, or </em><em>‘</em><em>the prophet</em><em>’</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan <em>River</em>, where John was baptizing.<strong>	</strong> <strong></span>

### :1 John’s Identification of Jesus as the Messiah


<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The next day he saw<sup>p</sup> Jesus coming, <em>“Look, the Lamb of God that </em><em>takes away the sin of the world! </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>He’s</em><em> the One I was talking about when I said, ‘After me </em><em>a man is</em><em> comin</em><em>g that has become before me</em><em> because he </em><em>existed before me</em><em>.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>I didn’t know who he</em><em> was; but to point him out to Israel, I came </em><em>immersing</em><em> in water.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>I’ve seen the Spirit coming down from the sky like a dove and remaining on him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>The One that sent me to </em><em>immerse people</em><em> in water told me, ‘Whoever you see the Spirit coming down and remaining on is the One that will </em><em>‘immerse’</em><em> </em>them <em>in the Holy Spirit.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>I’ve seen</em><em> </em>that<em>,</em><em> and</em><em> I’m</em><em> </em><em>telling you,</em><em> this is </em><em>God’s</em><em> Son.”</em>	<strong>J</strong><strong>n 1:29-34</strong> <strong>The First Disciples of Jesus</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The next day John was standing with a couple disciples. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>When he saw Jesus walk by, he said, <em>“Look, t</em><em>he Lamb of God!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>His two disciples followed Jesus. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Jesus turned around and saw them, <em>“What are you looking for?”</em> <em>	“Rabbi (</em><em>Teacher</em><em>)</em><em>, where are you staying?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two that followed Jesus. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>The first thing Andrew did was go<sup>p</sup> and find<sup>p</sup> his brother Simon, <em>“</em><em>We’ve found the Messiah (</em><em>the </em><em>Christ</em><em>)</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When he brought him to Jesus, Jesus looked at him, <em>“You’re Simon</em><em> Barjonah</em><em>; you’ll b</em><em>e called Cephas (</em><em>Peter</em><em>)</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The next day Jesus wanted to leave for Galilee. He found<sup>p</sup> Philip, <em>“</em><em>Come with</em><em> me.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong>Philip was from Bethsaida, where Andrew and Peter lived. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>Philip found<sup>p</sup> Nathanael, <em>“We’ve found the One that Moses and the </em><em>P</em><em>rophets wrote about in the </em><em>L</em><em>aw:</em><em> </em><em>Jesus son of Joseph</em><em> from Nazareth</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Nathanael said, <em>“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”</em> <em>“</em><em>I’ll show you</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus saw Nathanael coming, <em>“A true Israelite with no deceit in him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Nathanael said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Where do you know me from</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Nathanael answered, <em>“Rabbi, you’</em><em>re the Son of God, the k</em><em>ing of Israel!”</em></span>
