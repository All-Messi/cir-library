## John Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Jesus appeared again to his disciples at Lake Tiberias. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Simon Peter, Thomas, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples were together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Simon Peter said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“I’m going fishing.”</em> <em>“We’ll go with you.”</em> They went out and got in the boat, and that night didn’t catch anything. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When morning came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn’t know it was him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“</em><em>Fellows</em><em>, you haven’t had anything to eat, have you?”</em> <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“Throw</em><em> the net o</em><em>n the right side of the boat;</em><em> you’ll find some.”</em> So they did, and they couldn’t haul it in for the number of fish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The disciple Jesus loved said<sup>p</sup> to Peter, <em>“It’s the Lord!”</em> When Simon Peter heard that, he put on his outer garment (he’d stripped down) and dived into the lake. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The rest of the disciples came in the small boat because they were only about 300 feet from shore, dragging the net full of fish. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When they got out of the boat, they saw<sup>p</sup> a charcoal fire with a fish and a loaf laid on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus told<sup>p</sup> them, <em>“Bring some of the fish you just caught.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Simon Peter got up and pulled the net up onto land full of big fish—153. Although there were so many, the net didn’t tear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Come eat breakfast.”</em> None of the disciples dared to ask him who he was;<em> </em>they knew it was the Lord. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He gave<sup>p</sup> them the bread and fish. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>That was a third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he resurrected.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When they’d finished breakfast, Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Simon</em><em> </em>Bar<em>j</em><em>onah</em><em>, do you love me more than these do?”</em> <em>“Yes, Lord, you know I love you.”</em> <em>“Tend my lambs.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He said<sup>p</sup> the second time, <em>“Simon</em><em> </em>Bar<em>jonah</em><em>, do you love me?”</em> <em>“Yes, Lord, you know I love you.”</em> <em>“Tend my sheep.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He said<sup>p</sup> the third time, <em>“Simon</em><em> Barjonah</em><em>, do you love me?”</em> It pained Peter that Jesus asked a third time, <em>“Do you love me?”</em><em> </em>He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Lord, you know everything; you know I love you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jesus told him, <em>“Tend my sheep. When you were younger, you’</em><em>d </em><em>get </em><em>dress</em><em>ed</em><em> and walk wherever you wanted to.</em><em> </em><em>When you get old, you’ll stretch out your hands, and somebody else will dress you and carry you where you don’t want to go.” </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>(He said that to indicate by what kind of death he would honor God.) When he’d said that, he told him. <em>“Follow me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Peter turned around and saw<sup>p</sup> the disciple Jesus loved, following, the one that leaned back on Jesus’ chest at the supper and asked, <em>“Lord, who’s going to betray you?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Peter said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>W</em><em>hat about him?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“If I want him to </em><em>live</em><em> till I come back, what’s that to you?</em><em> </em><em>You follow me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So the rumor got out among the believers that he wouldn’t die. But Jesus didn’t say he wouldn’t die; he said, <em>“If I want him to </em><em>live</em><em> til</em><em>l I come back, what’s that to you?”</em><strong> </strong><strong>            </strong><strong>Jn 21:1-23</strong> 	<strong>Epilogue</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I’m the disciple that wrote this <em>book</em>. I know what I’m telling you is true. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Jesus did a lot of other things too, but if every one was written down, I suppose the world couldn’t hold all the books.</span>
