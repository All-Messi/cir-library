## John Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Jesus appeared again to his disciples at Lake Tiberias. 2Simon Peter, Thomas, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two other disciples were together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Simon Peter saidp, "I'm going fishing." They went out and got in the boat, and that night didn't catch anything. 4When morning came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn't know it was him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The disciple Jesus loved saidp to Peter, "It's the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that, he put on his outer garment (he'd stripped down) and dived into the lake. 8The rest of the disciples came in the small boat because they were only about 300 feet from shore, dragging the net full of fish. 9When they got out of the boat, they sawp a charcoal fire with a fish and a loaf laid on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus toldp them, "Bring some of the fish you just caught."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Simon Peter got up and pulled the net up onto land full of big fish—153. Although there were so many, the net didn't tear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jesus saidp, "Come eat breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him who he was; they knew it was the Lord. 13He gavep them the bread and fish. 14That was a third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he resurrected.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When they'd finished breakfast, Jesus saidp, "Simon Barjonah, do you love me more than these do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He saidp the second time, "Simon Barjonah, do you love me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He saidp the third time, "Simon Barjonah, do you love me?" It pained Peter that Jesus asked a third time, "Do you love me?" He saidp, "Lord, you know everything; you know I love you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jesus told him, "Tend my sheep. When you were younger, you'd get dressed and walk wherever you wanted to. When you get old, you'll stretch out your hands, and somebody else will dress you and carry you where you don't want to go." 19(He said that to indicate by what kind of death he would honor God.) When he'd said that, he told him. "Follow me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Peter turned around and sawp the disciple Jesus loved, following, the one that leaned back on Jesus' chest at the supper and asked, "Lord, who's going to betray you?" 21Peter saidp, "What about him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Jesus saidp, "If I want him to live till I come back, what's that to you? You follow me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So the rumor got out among the believers that he wouldn't die. But Jesus didn't say he wouldn't die; he said, "If I want him to live till I come back, what's that to you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I'm the disciple that wrote this book. I know what I'm telling you is true. 25Jesus did a lot of other things too, but if every one was written down, I suppose the world couldn't hold all the books.
