## John Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>After this, Jesus appeared again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>This is </strong><strong>what</strong><strong> happened.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>Together were Simon Peter, Thomas, Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>Simon Peter said, </strong><strong><em>“I’m going fishing.”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“We’ll go with you.”</em></strong> <strong>They went out and got in the boat, and that night they didn‘t catch anything.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>When morning was coming, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><em>“Children, you haven’t had anything to eat, have you?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“No.”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong><em>“Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you’ll find some.”</em></strong> <strong>So they cast</strong><strong> it</strong><strong>, and they weren’</strong><strong>t strong enoug</strong><strong>h to haul it in because ot</strong><strong> the number of fish.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>The disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, </strong><strong><em>“It’s the Lord!”</em></strong> <strong>	When Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment </strong><strong>(he had stripped down) </strong><strong>and jumped in the sea.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>The other disciples came in the small boat, because they were not far from land—only about three hundred feet</strong><strong> away</strong><strong>, dragging the net full of fish.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><strong>When they got out of the boat, they saw a charcoal fire laid with a fish and </strong><strong>a loaf</strong><strong> laid on it.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><strong>Jesus told them, </strong><strong><em>“Bring some of the fish you just caught.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup><strong>Simon Peter got up and drew the net </strong><strong>on</strong><strong>to land full of large fish—153; and though th</strong><strong>ere were so many, the net didn’</strong><strong>t tear.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>Jesus said, </strong><strong><em>“Come and eat breakfast.”</em></strong> <strong>None of the disciples dared to ask him, </strong><strong><em>“Who are you?”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>They knew it was the Lord.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><strong>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish as well.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><strong>This was </strong><strong>a</strong><strong> third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after being raised from the dead.</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> Peter, </strong><strong><em>“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these do?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“Yes, Lord, you know I love you.”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“Tend my lambs.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong>He said a second time, </strong><strong><em>“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“Yes, Lord, you know I love you.”</em></strong> <strong>	</strong><strong><em>“Tend my sheep.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong>He said the third time, </strong><strong><em>“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</em></strong> <strong>	Peter was pained that Jesus said a third time, </strong><strong><em>“Do you love me?” </em></strong><strong>and said, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, you know everything; you know I love you.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong>Jesus said to him, </strong><strong><em>“Tend my sheep.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong><em>’m</em></strong><strong><em> tell</em></strong><strong><em>ing</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>you, when you were younger, you’</em></strong><strong><em>d dress yourself and walk</em></strong><strong><em> around</em></strong><strong><em> wherever you wanted to.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>When you get old, you’ll stretch out your hands, and somebody else will dress you and carry you where you don’t want to go.” </em></strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><strong>(He said this to </strong><strong>indicte</strong><strong> by what kind of death he would glorify God.)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>When he had said this, he said to him.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>“Follow me.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><strong>When Peter tur</strong><strong>ned around, he saw the disciple</strong><strong> Jesus loved, following, who had leaned back on Jesus’ chest at the supper and said, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, who’s the one that’s going to betray you?”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><strong>When Peter saw him, he said, </strong><strong><em>“Lord, what about him?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>J</strong><strong>esus</strong><strong> said, </strong><strong><em>“If I want him to </em></strong><strong><em>live</em></strong><strong><em> till I come back, what’s that to you?</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>You follow me.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>So the idea circulated among the brothers that he wouldn’t die.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>But Jesus </strong><strong>didn’t day he wouldn’t die; he </strong><strong>said, “If I want him to </strong><strong>live</strong><strong> till I come, what’s that to you?”</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>   </strong><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>    </strong><strong> </strong><strong>    </strong></span>

### Epilogue


<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong>This is the disciple</strong><strong> that </strong><strong>wrote down</strong><strong> these matters, and we know his witness is true.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong>Jesus did many other things.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>If every one was written down, the world could</strong><strong>n’t</strong><strong> hold the books.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>   </strong><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>    </strong><strong> </strong></span>
