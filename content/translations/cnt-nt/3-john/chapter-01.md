## 3 John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> What was from the beginning, what we’ve heard and seen, what we’ve observed and touched about the living message—<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>the eternal life that was with the Father and he revealed to us—that’s what <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>we’re passing along to you so we can have it in common with you as well as with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>We’re writing these things <em>to you </em>to fully share our joy.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Jn 1:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I pray that you'll be as prosperous and healthy in every way as you are in your soul. 3I was so happy when the brothers reported that you really live by the truth. 4Nothing makes me happier than hearing that my children are doing that.</span>
<p class="section-ref">3 Jn 1-4</p>

### Cooperation and Opposition


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The message is that God is light; there’s no darkness in him at all. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>If we claim to be in fellowship with him and live in the dark, we’re lying and not practicing the truth. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>If we live in the light with him, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of his Son continues to cleanse us from sin.  <strong><sup>8-</sup></strong><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>If we claim we don’t have any sin, we deceive ourselves and make God a liar. If we admit we’ve sinned, we can trust him to be just and forgive us of everything. <strong>1 Jn 1:5-10</strong> <strong>Christ Our Advocate</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to take charge among them, wouldn't receive us. 10So if I come, I'll remind people how he slanders us, and—more than that—doesn't receive disciples, stops the ones that want to, and excommunicates them from the church.</span>
<p class="section-ref">3 Jn 9-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Imitate good, not evil. Whoever does what's good belongs to God; whoever does what's evil hasn't seen him. 12Demetrius receives good testimony from everybody, from the truth itself, and from us. You know you can rely on what we say.</span>
<p class="section-ref">3 Jn 11-12</p>

### Farewell


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I've had so much I want to tell yousg but not in writing. 14I hope to see you soon and speak to you in person. Peace to you. Your friends send their greetings. Greet your friends by name.</span>
