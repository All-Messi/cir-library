## 3 John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Elder to Gaius, that I truly love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I pray that you'll be as prosperous and healthy in every way as you are in your soul. 3I was so happy when the brothers reported that you really live by the truth. 4Nothing makes me happier than hearing that my children are doing that. 	3 Jn 1-4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Friendsg, you're acting faithfully in what you do for your fellow believers in ChristMessiah, especially for the ones you don't know. 6In front of the church, they've testified to your love. You do well to send them forward in a way worthy of God. 7They went out for The Name, not taking anything from Gentiles. 8We should support servants like them and so become their true fellow workers. 	3 Jn 5-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to take charge among them, wouldn't receive us. 10So if I come, I'll remind people how he slanders us, and—more than that—doesn't receive disciples, stops the ones that want to, and excommunicates them from the church.                                                               	3 Jn 9-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Imitate good, not evil. Whoever does what's good belongs to God; whoever does what's evil hasn't seen him. 12Demetrius receives good testimony from everybody, from the truth itself, and from us. You know you can rely on what we say. 	3 Jn 11-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I've had so much I want to tell yousg but not in writing. 14I hope to see you soon and speak to you in person. Peace to you. Your friends send their greetings. Greet your friends by name.  	 3 Jn 13-14</span>
