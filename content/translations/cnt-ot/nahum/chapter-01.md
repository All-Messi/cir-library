## Nahum Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD is an exclusive God that avenges with anger. He carries out vengeance on his adversaries; he stores up anger for his enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He doesn't get mad quick, but he does exert his power; he doesn't let the guilty go free. He displays his power in storms and tornadoes; clouds are dust beneath his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> At his command seas and rivers dry up, Bashan and Carmel wither, Lebanon's blossoms wilt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> In his presence, mountains quake and hills melt; earth trembles and its people perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his furious anger? He pours out wrath like fire and cracks rocks in pieces.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The LORD is good, a fortress in times of trouble; he knows who takes refuge in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But with an overwhelming flood, he brings his opponents to a complete end and chases his enemies into the dark.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Whatever you're plotting against the LORD he'll put an end to; he doesn't need to take revenge twice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> His enemies, like tangled thornbushes and staggering people, he'll completely burn up like stubble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Who is this counselor of yours that plots against the LORD with bad advice?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> This is what the LORD says, "Though strong and numerous, the Assyrians will perish and disappear. Though I've let them punish you before, I won't let them do it again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll break their yoke off your neck and tear their shackles off your feet."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD has issued an edict about you, Assyria: "No offspring will carry on your name; I'll remove idol and image from the temples of your gods. I'll get your grave ready because you're contemptible."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Over the mountains, a messenger is coming with good news, someone that's announcing peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows; those wicked invaders will never attack you again. I'll completely destroy them. Nineveh to Fall</span>
