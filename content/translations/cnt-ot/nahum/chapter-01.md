## Nahum Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD is an exclusive God</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He doesn't get mad quick,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> At his command seas and rivers dry up,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> In his presence, mountains quake and hills melt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Who can withstand his indignation?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The LORD is good, a fortress in times of trouble;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But with an overwhelming flood,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Whatever you're plotting against the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> His enemies, like tangled thornbushes and staggering people,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Who is this counselor of yours</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> This is what the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll break their yoke off your neck</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD has issued an edict about you, Assyria:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Over the mountains, a messenger is coming with good news,</span>
