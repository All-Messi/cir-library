## Nahum Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits bloody Nineveh,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Do you hear the crack of whips, rattling wheels,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Do you see cavalry charging,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> That's all because of your continual prostitution,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll throw filth on you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Everybody that sees you will back away and say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Are you any better than Thebes</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Nubia was its strength,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Yet Thebes was carried into captivity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You'll get drunk too, Nineveh, go into a stupor,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Your fortresses are like fig trees with ripe fruit;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Your troops are women!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Draw water for your siege!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But fire will burn you up;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Though your guards are like grasshoppers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Your shepherds are asleep, king of Assyria;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> There's no relief for your injury;</span>
