### and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerushah daughter of Zadok. 2He did what was good like his father, but he didn’t go into the Temple. The people kept acting corruptly. 3He built the upper gate of the LORD’s Temple and built extensively the wall of Ophel. 4He built towns in the hill country of Judah, and fortresses and towers on the wooded hills. 5He fought the Ammonites and prevailed; for three years they paid him 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 110,000 bushels 10,000 kors of wheat, and 110,000 bushels 10,000 kors of barley a year. 6He became powerful because he ordered his ways in the LORD his God. 7The rest of the acts of Jotham, including his wars, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
