## 2 Chronicles Chapter **31**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When that finished, Israel went out and broke down the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, pulled down the high places and altars, and destroyed them everywhere in Judah and Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh. Then they returned to their towns and properties.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Hezekiah appointed the divisions of priests and Levites, according to each one’s service: for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister, give thanks and praise in the camp of the LORD. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He also appointed the kings’ portion of goods for the burnt offerings—for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the Sabbaths, new moons, and fixed festivals like the Law says. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He commanded the people in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>As soon as the order spread, the Israelites provided in abundance a tenth of the first part of the harvest of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and produce.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The ones that lived in the towns in Judah also brought in a tenth of the oxen and sheep, and a tenth of the sacred gifts consecrated to the LORD and placed <em>them</em> in piles. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>In the third month, they began to make the piles and finished them by the seventh. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the piles, they blessed the LORD and his people. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Hezekiah asked the chief priests and Levites about the piles. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Azariah, the chief priest from the House of Zadok, said, <em>“Since the contributions </em><em>started coming</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> the </em>LORD<em>’s</em><em> Temple</em><em>, we’ve had enough to eat with </em><em>this amount</em><em> left over</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>He</em><em> </em><em>h</em><em>as blessed his people.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Then Hezekiah told them to prepare rooms in the Temple. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes, and consecrated things. Conaniah the Levite had charge of them; his brother Shimei was second in rank.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under Conaniah and Shimei his brother. Azariah was the chief officer for God’s Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the eastern gate, oversaw the freewill offerings and apportioned the contributions for the LORD and the most holy things. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah assisted him in the priestly towns to distribute faithfully the portions to their fellow Jews by divisions, young and old alike. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Without regard to their genealogical enrollment, <em>they were to do it </em>for</span>
<p class="section-ref">males 30</p>

### and older for their duties in their divisions—everybody that entered the LORD’s Temple for his daily obligations. 17They were to do it as well to the priests genealogically enrolled by families, and the Levites 20 years and older, according to their duties and divisions. 18The genealogical enrollment included their little children, wives, sons, and daughters for the whole assembly, because they consecrated themselves faithfully in holiness. 19For the descendants of Aaron (the priests that were in their towns’ pastures or in each city), there were men designated to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everybody genealogically enrolled among the Levites.


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Hezekiah did that throughout Judah. What he did was good, right, and true in front of the LORD. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He looked to his God in the service of God’s Temple in law and commandment, and did everything with all his heart and succeeded.<strong>   </strong><strong>	    </strong></span>
