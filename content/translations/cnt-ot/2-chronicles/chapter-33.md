## 2 Chronicles Chapter 33

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Manasseh was 12 and ruled for 55 years in Jerusalem. 2He did evil like the nations the LORD drove out. 3He rebuilt the high places Hezekiah had torn down, erected altars for the images of Baal, set up Asherah poles, and worshiped and served the stars in the sky. 4He built altars in the LORD's Temple where the LORD had said, "I will identify with Jerusalem permanently." 5He built altars for the host of heaven in the two courts of the LORD's Temple. 6He burned his sons as an offering in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom. He angered the LORD with lots of sins he did: witchcraft, fortunetelling, sorcery, consulting mediums and spiritists. 7Then he put in God's Temple the carved image of the idol he'd made about which God had told David and Solomon his son, "I've chosen to identify myself permanently with this Temple and with Jerusalem out of all the tribes in Israel. 8I won't again remove Israel from the land I've appointed for their ancestors, if only they'll observe everything I've commanded them in the Law, statutes, and ordinances I gave through Moses."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Manasseh misled Judah and Jerusalem to sin than the nations the LORD originally destroyed in front of the Israelites.	2 Ch 33:1-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they didn't pay any attention. 11So he brought the commanders of Assyria's army against them. They captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze chains, and took him to Babylon. 12When he was in distress, he appealed to the LORD and humbled himself greatly in the presence of his ancestors' God. 13When he prayed to him, God was moved by his appeal and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew the LORD was God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> After that, he built an outer wall for The City of David on the west side of the Gihon in the valley, as far as the entrance to the Fish Gate. It encircled Ophel and was very tall. Then he put army commanders in the fortified towns of Judah. 15He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the LORD's Temple as well as the altars he'd built earlier on the mountain of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and dumped them outside the city. 16He set up the LORD's altar and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it. He ordered Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. 17The people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to the LORD. 	2 Ch 33:10-17</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The rest of the acts of Manasseh, including his prayer to God and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the LORD's name, are in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 19Also recorded in The Chronicles of the Seers are his sin and unfaithfulness, the sites where he built high places, set up Asherah poles and carved images before he humbled himself and appealed to God.  20Manasseh died, and they buried him in his own house. His son Amon became king.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Amon was 22 and ruled for 2 years in Jerusalem. 22He did evil like Manasseh had done. He sacrificed to the carved images his father had made and served them. 23He didn't humble himself like his father did, but multiplied his guilt. 24Finally, his own officials murdered him in his own house, 25but the people killed them and made his son Josiah king. 	2 Ch 33:18-25</span>
