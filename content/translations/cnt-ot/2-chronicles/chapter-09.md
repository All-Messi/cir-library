## 2 Chronicles Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She brought a large contingent of camels carrying spices, and lots of gold and precious stones. When she got there, she talked to him about everything on her mind. 2He answered her questions; there wasn't anything he couldn't explain to her. 3When she'd seen his wisdom, the palace he'd built, 4the food at his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance by his servers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, the stairway he used to go up to the LORD's Temple, she was breathless, 5"The report was true that I heard in my country about your words and wisdom. 6But I didn't believe it till I saw it. They didn't tell me half of it. 7How fortunate your officers must feel, being around you continually and listening to your wisdom. 8Bless the LORD your God that delighted in you and set you on his throne. He loved Israel and established the nation permanently; that's why he made you their king—to do justice and goodness." 	2 Ch 9:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 9:13-21</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> She gave him 4½ tons 120 talents of gold and a large amount of spices and precious stones. There'd never been spices like what she gave him. 10Then Hiram and Solomon's crews brought gold from Ophir plus algum wood and precious stones. 11From the algum wood he made steps for the LORD's Temple and the king's palace as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Nobody in Judah had ever seen anything like them. 12King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for—more than what she'd brought him. Then she and her attendants went back to her country.	 2 Ch 9:9-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 25 tons 666 talents 14besides what traders and merchants brought, and besides the gold and silver the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought. 15King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 15 lbs 600 shekels of beaten gold on each one. 16He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using 300 gold shekels on each one. He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 17He made a large throne out of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 18It had 6 steps leading up to it, a gold footstool attached to it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside the arms. 1912 lions stood on opposite sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 20King Solomon's drinking cups were made out of gold. The items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Silver wasn't considered valuable in his time. 21He had ships that went to Tarshish every three years with Hiram's sailors, and brought back gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> King Solomon became greater than any other king anywhere in wealth and wisdom. 23Kings from all over the world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God put in him. 24Each one brought his gift: silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules—so much a year.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots and 12,000 cavalry. He stationed them in the chariot cities and with him in Jerusalem. 26He ruled the kings from the Euphrates River to the Philistine border and the border of Egypt. 27He made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the western foothills. 28They brought horses for Solomon from Egypt and every country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The rest of the acts of Solomon, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, The Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and The Visions of Iddo the Seer about Jeroboam son of Nebat. 30He ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem over all Israel. 31He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Rehoboam reigned.	 2 Ch 9:22-31</span>
