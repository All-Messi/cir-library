## 2 Chronicles Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She brought a large contingent of camels carrying spices, and lots of gold and precious stones. When she got there, she talked to him about everything on her mind. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He answered her questions; there wasn’t anything he couldn’t explain to her. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When she’d seen his wisdom, the palace he’d built, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>the food at his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance by his servers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, the stairway he used to go up to the LORD’s Temple, she was breathless, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“The</em><em> report </em><em>was true that </em><em>I heard in my country about your words and wisdom.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> I didn’t believe it till I saw it.</em><em> They didn’t tell me h</em><em>alf of </em><em>it</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>How</em><em> </em><em>fortunate</em><em> your </em><em>officers</em><em> </em><em>must feel, being around you </em><em>continually and listen</em><em>ing</em><em> to your wisdom.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Bless</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God that delighted in you and set you on his throne.</em><em> </em><em>He loved Israel</em><em> and established the </em>nation<em> permanently; that’s why he made you their king—to do justice and </em><em>good</em><em>ness.”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>

### ½ tons 120 talents of gold and a large amount of spices and precious stones. There’d never been spices like what she gave him. 10Then Hiram and Solomon’s crews brought gold from Ophir plus algum wood and precious stones. 11From the algum wood he made steps for the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Nobody in Judah had ever seen anything like them. 12King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for—more than what she’d brought him. Then she and her attendants went back to her country.	 2 Ch 9:9-12 Solomon’s Wealth and Spendor

He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 17He made a large throne out of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 18It had 6 steps leading up to it, a gold footstool attached to it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside the arms. 1912 lions stood on opposite sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 20King Solomon’s drinking cups were made out of gold. The items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Silver wasn’t considered valuable in his time. 21He had ships that went to Tarshish every three years with Hiram’s sailors, and brought back gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks.	  	2 Ch 9:13-21
