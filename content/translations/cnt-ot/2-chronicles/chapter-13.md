### ,000 trained soldiers; Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 trained soldiers.	 2 Ch 13:1-3


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and shouted, <em>“Jeroboam and all Israel, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>d</em><em>on’t</em><em> you know that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God of Israel gave the rule over Israel permanently to David and his </em><em>descendants</em><em> by a covenant of </em><em>salt?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> Jeroboam </em><em>rebelled against him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Worthless</em><em> men g</em><em>athered around him, scoundrels that proved to be too strong for </em><em>the son of Solomon</em><em> when he was young and timid and couldn’t hold his own against them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> now you intend to resist the kingdom of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>by</em><em> the </em><em>descendants</em><em> of David</em><em> because you have </em><em>a </em><em>big</em><em> </em><em>army</em><em> and the golden calves Jeroboam made </em><em>as</em><em> </em><em><u>your</u></em><em> </em><em>gods.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Haven’t</em><em> you driven out the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> </em><em>priests, the </em><em>descendants</em><em> of Aaron and the Levites, and made </em><em>your own priests like </em><em>people in other </em><em>countrie</em><em>s?</em><em> </em><em>Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, can</em><em> become a priest for what aren’</em><em>t gods.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>he</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is </em><em><u>our</u></em><em> God.</em><em> </em><em>We haven’t </em><em>left him. T</em><em>he </em><em>descendants</em><em> of Aaron are </em><em>serving</em><em> </em><em>him</em><em> as priest</em><em>s</em><em> and the </em><em>Levites </em><em>are doing</em><em> their work.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Every</em><em> morning they burn burnt offerings and fragrant incense</em><em> to him. They set </em><em>the showbread on the clean table, and the golden lampstand with its lamps is ready to light every evening, because we</em><em>’re</em><em> keep</em><em>ing</em><em> the charge of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> our God. B</em><em>ut you’ve </em><em>left</em><em> him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> is at our head and his priests with the signal </em><em>bugle</em><em>s to sound the alarm against you, Israel.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t fight </em><em>with</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God of your ancestors</em><em>;</em><em> you won’t </em><em>prevail</em><em>.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>But Jeroboam had set an ambush from the rear, so Israel lay in front of Judah and behind. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When Judah turned around, Israel attacked them from the front and back. <em>Israel</em> cried out to the LORD, the priests blew the bugles, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and Judah’s soldiers raised the battle cry. When they did, God routed Jeroboam and Israel in front of Abijah and Judah. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When the Israelites fled, God delivered them to <em>Judah</em>. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Abijah and his army defeated them with a massacre</span>
