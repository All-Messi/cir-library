## 2 Chronicles Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Abijah died, they buried him in The City of David, and his son Asa became king. The country had peace for 10 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Asa did what was good. 3He removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the scared pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, 4and commanded Judah to look to the LORD God of their ancestors and to observe the Law and the commandments. 5He removed the high places and incense altars from the towns in Judah. 6He built fortified towns in Judah since the LORD had given the country rest. 7He said to Judah, "Let's build these towns and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The country is still ours because we've sought the LORD, and he's given us rest all around." They built and prospered. 8Asa had a standing army of 300,000 from Judah that carried spears and large shields and 280,000 from Benjamin that carried shields and handled bows—fearless soldiers.	2 Ch 14:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Now Zerah the Nubian came out against them at Mareshah with 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots. 10Asa went out to engage him. They drew up in battle formation in the Valley of Zaphathah at Mareshah. 11Asa called to the LORD, "No one but you can help us in this battle of the weak against the strong. You're our God. Help us against this army. Don't let any mortal prevail against you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The LORD routed the Nubians in front of Asa and Judah. 13Asa and the people chased them as far as Gerar. So many Nubians fell that they couldn't recover. The LORD and his army shattered them. Judah carried away a lot of plunder. 14They destroyed the towns around Gerar because the dread of the LORD had fallen on them. They plundered them all, a lot of plunder. 15They also struck down the livestock owners and took away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they went back to Jerusalem.	      2 Ch 14:9-15</span>
