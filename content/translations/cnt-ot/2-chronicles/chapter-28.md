### and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do what was good like David did. 2He followed the kings of Israel, made molten images for the worshipping Baal, 3burned incense in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, and burned his sons like the nations the LORD had driven out. 4He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places on the hills under every green tree.

You’ve killed them in a rage that has reached heaven. 10Now you intend to make slaves out of the men and women from Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t you have sins of your own against your God? 11Take back the ones you’ve captured from your kin. The LORD’s furious anger has turned against you.”


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Some leaders of Ephraim—Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those returning from battle, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Don’t</em><em> </em><em>bring th</em><em>e captives in here</em><em>.</em><em> You’</em><em>re</em><em> about</em><em> to bring guilt o</em><em>n us against the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> and add to our sins. We have a lot of guilt, so </em><em>his </em><em>furious</em><em> anger </em><em>has turned</em><em> against </em><em>us</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>The armed men left the captives and spoil with the officers and the assembly. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Designated men took the captives and put clothes from the spoil on the naked ones. They gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them something to drink, put olive oil on their wounds, led their feeble ones on donkeys, and took the captives to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of Palms. Then they came back to Samaria.<strong>	</strong></span>

### Ahaz Closes the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>At that time, King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The Edomites had attacked Judah again and taken captives. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The Philistines had invaded the towns in the western foothills and the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, and settled there. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> was </em>because the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz; he’d brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was terribly unfaithful to the LORD. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, came and attacked him instead of reinforcing him. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Ahaz took a portion out of the Temple, the king’s palace, and the officials’ houses and gave it to the king of Assyria; but he didn’t help him. <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Ch 28:16-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>In his distress, this same King Ahaz became more unfaithful to the LORD. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him, <em>“</em><em>Since</em><em> the gods of </em><em>Aram</em><em> helpe</em><em>d them, I’ll sacrifice to </em><em>them</em><em> s</em><em>o they’ll help </em><em><u>me</u></em><em>.”</em> But they became his and Israel’s downfall. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When Ahaz gathered the utensils from God’s Temple, he cut them in pieces. He closed the doors of the Temple and built altars in every corner of Jerusalem. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>In every city in Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods and made the LORD angry. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The rest of his ways and deeds, first to last, are recorded in <em>The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel</em>. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Ahaz died, and they buried him in Jerusalem but not in the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah reigned.<strong>	    </strong></span>
