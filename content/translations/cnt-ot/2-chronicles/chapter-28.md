## 2 Chronicles Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ahaz was 20 and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. He didn't do what was good like David did. 2He followed the kings of Israel, made molten images for the worshipping Baal, 3burned incense in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, and burned his sons like the nations the LORD had driven out. 4He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places on the hills under every green tree.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 28:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD delivered him to the king of Aram. They defeated Ahaz and took a large number of captives to Damascus. God also delivered him to the king of Israel, who inflicted great casualties on him. 6Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in one day, all trained soldiers, because they'd left the LORD God of their ancestors. 7Zichri, a powerful man in Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the king's son; Azrikam, the palace commander; and Elkanah, the king's second in command.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then Israel took away 200,000 women, sons, and daughters; and a great deal of spoil. 9But the LORD's prophet Oded met the army coming to Samaria, "Because the LORD God was angry with Judah, he delivered them to you. You've killed them in a rage that has reached heaven. 10Now you intend to make slaves out of the men and women from Judah and Jerusalem. Don't you have sins of your own against your God? 11Take back the ones you've captured from your kin. The LORD's furious anger has turned against you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Some leaders of Ephraim—Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those returning from battle, 13"Don't bring the captives in here. You're about to bring guilt on us against the LORD and add to our sins. We have a lot of guilt, so his furious anger has turned against us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The armed men left the captives and spoil with the officers and the assembly. 15Designated men took the captives and put clothes from the spoil on the naked ones. They gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them something to drink, put olive oil on their wounds, led their feeble ones on donkeys, and took the captives to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of Palms. Then they came back to Samaria.	2 Ch 28:8-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> At that time, King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help. 17The Edomites had attacked Judah again and taken captives. 18The Philistines had invaded the towns in the western foothills and the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, and settled there. 19That was because the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz; he'd brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was terribly unfaithful to the LORD. 20Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, came and attacked him instead of reinforcing him. 21Ahaz took a portion out of the Temple, the king's palace, and the officials' houses and gave it to the king of Assyria; but he didn't help him. 	2 Ch 28:16-21</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> In his distress, this same King Ahaz became more unfaithful to the LORD. 23He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him, "Since the gods of Aram helped them, I'll sacrifice to them so they'll help me." But they became his and Israel's downfall. 24When Ahaz gathered the utensils from God's Temple, he cut them in pieces. He closed the doors of the Temple and built altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 25In every city in Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods and made the LORD angry. 26The rest of his ways and deeds, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 27Ahaz died, and they buried him in Jerusalem but not in the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah reigned.	    2 Ch 28:22-27</span>
