## 2 Chronicles Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jehoshaphat died, and they buried him in The City of David. His son Jehoram became king. 2His brothers were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariyahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. 3Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and other precious things along with fortified towns in Judah. But he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, his firstborn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When Jehoram had taken over the kingdom and made himself secure, he killed his brothers with the sword and some of the rulers too. 5He was 32 when he became king and ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 6He followed the ways of Israel's kings like Ahab did. (His wife was Ahab's daughter.) He did evil, 7but because of his covenant with David, the LORD wouldn't destroy David's house. He'd promised to give him and his descendants a lamp permanently.     2 Ch 21:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> During his reign Edom revolted and set up its own king. 9So Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots. He got up at night and struck down the Edomites and the commanders of the chariots that were surrounding him. 10But Edom is still independent from Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time because Jehoram had left the LORD God of his ancestors. 11Besides, he made high places in the mountains in Judah, and led the people in Jerusalem to carry on religious prostitution.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Elijah the prophet sent him a letter: "The LORD, God of your ancestor David, says, 'You've not followed the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and Asa king of Judah. 13You've followed the kings of Israel and made Judah and Israel carry on religious prostitution like Ahab's house did. You've even killed your own brothers, who were better than you. 14I'm going to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and everything you own with catastrophe. 15You'll suffer with a severe intestinal disease till your bowels come out.'"	2 Ch 21:8-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then the LORD stirred up the Philistines and Arabs that bordered the Nubians. 17They invaded Judah and carried away everything in the king's palace, including his sons and wives. He didn't have any son left except Jehoahaz, the youngest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> In addition, the LORD struck him with an incurable disease. 19In 2 years, his bowels came out, and he died in severe pain. His people built no fire for him like they did for his ancestors. 20He died with nobody's regret. They buried him in The City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.	2 Ch 21:16-20</span>
