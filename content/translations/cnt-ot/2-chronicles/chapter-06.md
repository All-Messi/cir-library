<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Solomon said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 6:36-42</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then he faced the people and blessed the assembly standing there, 4"Bless the LORD God of Israel, who said to my father David, 5'From the time I brought my people out of Egypt, I hadn't chosen a city to build a temple in for my name. I hadn't chosen any man as a leader over Israel. 6But I've chosen Jerusalem as the place to identify with and David as leader over Israel. 7My father wanted to build him a temple, 8but the LORD said, 'You meant well, 9but you won't build me a temple; your son will.' 10He has fulfilled that promise; I've risen to the throne and built the temple for his name. 11That's where I've set the Ark that holds the covenant he made with Israel." 12-13Solomon had built a bronze platform 7½ x 7½ x 4½ft high beside the altar in the middle of the court. He stood on it, knelt, and spread out his hands toward heaven.                   	2 Ch 6:1-13 14"LORD God of Israel, there's no God like you in heaven or on earth. You keep covenant and show enduring love to everyone that follows you with all their heart. 15You've kept your promise to David. You've said it with your mouth and fulfilled it with your hand. 16Keep this promise too, 'You'll always have a descendant on Israel's throne if they follow my Law like you have.' 17Confirm that promise now. 18"But will you live with people on earth? The sky and highest heaven can't contain you, much less this Temple I've built. 19Yet attend to my petition. Listen to my call 20so you'll be looking toward this Temple day and night where you've said you'd put your name. 21Listen when your people and I pray toward this place. Listen from heaven and forgive. 22"When someone sins against another and comes here to take an oath at your altar, 23then listen from heaven and judge them. Punish the sinful by bringing their way on their own head and justify the good by rewarding them according to their goodness. 	2 Ch 6:14-23 24"When an enemy defeats your people because they've sinned, if they repent, confess your name, and petition you in this Temple, 25then listen from heaven, forgive them, and bring them back to the country you've given them and their ancestors. 26"When there's no rain because they've sinned against you and they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin when you punish them, 27then listen from heaven and forgive your people. Teach them the good way to live and send rain on the land you've given them to inherit.	2 Ch 6:24-27 28"When there's a famine in the country; disease, blight or mildew; locust or grasshopper; a sickness, or an enemy laying siege to our towns—29whatever petition your people make, each knowing their own suffering and pain and spreading their hands toward this Temple, 30then listen from where you live, forgive, and render to each as they've done—only you know everyone's heart—31so they'll respect you and follow your ways as long as they live in the country you've given their ancestors. 32"When foreigners come from a distant country because of your great name, your powerful hand and outstretched arm, and pray toward this Temple, 33then listen from where you live, and do everything they call to you for, so every nation will know you and respect you like your people do, and so they'll know that the Temple I've built wears your name. 34"When your people go out to battle by whatever way you send them and they pray to you toward this city you've chosen and the Temple I've built, 35then listen from heaven and support them. 	2 Ch 6:28-35 36"When they sin against you (everybody sins), you're angry with them, and deliver them to an enemy that takes them captive near or far, 37if they take it to heart, repent, and petition you, 'We've sinned, we've committed iniquity, we've acted wickedly'; 38if they come back to you with all their heart and soul, and pray toward the land you've given their ancestors, the city you've chosen, the Temple I've built, 39then listen from where you live, support them, and forgive them. 40"Open your eyes and ears to answer the prayer I've offered here. 41Rise, LORD God, to your resting place, you and your powerful Ark. Cover your priests with salvation; may your holy people celebrate what's good. 42Don't turn away from your anointed one. Remember your enduring love for your servant David."</span>
