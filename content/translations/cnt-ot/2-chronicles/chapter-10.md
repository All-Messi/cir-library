## 2 Chronicles Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then <strong>Rehoboam</strong> went to Shechem, because Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When Jeroboam heard about it, he came back. (He was in Egypt where he’d fled from Solomon.) <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They sent for him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they said to Rehoboam, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Your</em><em> father made our yoke h</em><em>eavy</em><em>.</em><em> L</em><em>ighten his hard service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we’ll serve you.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“Come</em><em> back in three days.”</em><em> </em> The people left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>He consulted the elders that had served his father Solomon, <em>“How do you </em><em>advise</em><em> me to answer the people?”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“If</em><em> </em><em>you’ll be kind to them,</em><em> please them</em><em>,</em><em> and speak good words to them, they’ll </em><em>serve you</em><em> permanently.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>But he disregarded their advice and consulted the young men he grew up with and served him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He asked them, <em>“What</em><em>’s</em><em> </em><em>your </em><em>advice?”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“Tell</em><em> them, ‘My little finger </em><em>is thicker than my father’s thigh</em><em>s!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> l</em><em>oaded you with a heavy yoke;</em><em> I’ll </em><em>make it heavier. He</em><em> disciplined you with whip</em><em>s;</em><em> I’ll discipline you with scorpions.’”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Ch 10:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><u>Jeroboam</u> and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day like he’d directed them. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The king answered them harshly and didn’t take the elders’ advice<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“My</em><em> father made your yoke heavy; </em><em>I’ll </em><em>make it heavier. M</em><em>y father </em><em>disciplined you with whips;</em><em> I’ll discipline you with scorpions.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He ignored the people, a turn of events the LORD allowed with the result that he would bring about his message through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, they answered, <em>	</em><em>“W</em><em>hat part do we have with</em><em> David</em><em>?</em> <em>	</em><em>	What </em><em>inheritance </em><em>do we have </em><em>in </em><em>Jesse’s</em><em> son</em><em>?</em> <em>	Every</em><em>body,</em><em> </em><em>go home</em><em>, Israel!”</em> <em>	Look after your own house, David</em><em>!</em><em>”</em> Israel left and went home. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But Rehoboam ruled the Israelites in the towns in Judah. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He sent Hadoram, who oversaw forced labor, and the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam hurried and got in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Israel has been in rebellion against David’s dynasty ever since.<strong>    </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
