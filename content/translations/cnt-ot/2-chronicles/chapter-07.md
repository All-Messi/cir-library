## 2 Chronicles Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from the sky and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices, and the LORD's glory filled the Temple. 2The priests couldn't go in because of it. 3When the Israelites saw the fire and the LORD's glory come down on the Temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground in worship and praised him, "He's truly good; his love endures forever."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 7:8-22</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then the king and the people sacrificed to the LORD 522,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. That's how he and the people dedicated God's Temple. 6The priests and Levites stood at their positions with the musical instruments King David had made for praising the LORD—"his love endures forever"—whenever he gave praise by their means, while the priests on the other side blew trumpets, and Israel stood. 7Solomon consecrated the middle of the court in front of the LORD's Temple, because that's where he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, and because the bronze altar he'd made couldn't hold the burnt offering, grain offering, and fat.	 2 Ch 7:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Solomon and all Israel observed the festival for a week, a huge assembly from Lebo-hamath to the River of Egypt. 9They observed the dedication of the altar, kept the festival, and held a solemn assembly on the eighth day. 10The twenty-third day, seventh month, Solomon sent the people home, celebrating and happy over the LORD's goodness to David, Solomon, and his people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Solomon finished the LORD's Temple, the king's palace, and everything he'd planned to do with them. 12Then the LORD appeared to him at night and said, "I've heard your prayer, and I've chosen this place as a temple for sacrificing. 13If I shut up the sky so there's no rain, or command locusts to devour the land, or send a plague among my people, 14and they humble themselves and pray, I'll hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and restore their land. 15My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayers offered here. 16I've chosen and consecrated this Temple so my name will be here permanently. 17If yousg conduct yourself like your father and do everything I've commanded you and keep my statutes and ordinances, 18I'll make your throne secure like I agreed with David to do, 'You'll always have a descendant on Israel's throne if they follow my Law like you have.' 19"But if youpl leave my statutes and commandments and worship and serve other gods, 20I'll uproot you from the country I've given you and throw aside this Temple I've consecrated to me. I'll make it an object of mockery, a byword the world over. 21Everybody that goes by will be amazed at this Temple that had been so highly praised, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this country and this Temple?' 22People will answer, 'They abandoned the LORD God who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They adopted other gods, worshiped and served them.'"</span>
