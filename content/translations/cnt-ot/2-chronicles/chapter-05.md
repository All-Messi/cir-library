## 2 Chronicles Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When Solomon finished the work on the LORD’s Temple, he brought in the silver, gold, and utensils David had dedicated, and put them in the treasuries in God’s Temple. <strong>The Ark Brought to the Temple</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Then he gathered to Jerusalem the elders in Israel, the leaders of tribes and families, in preparation for bringing up the Ark from The City of David (Zion). <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The men of Israel gathered to him at the festival in the seventh month. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The elders came, and the Levites picked up the Ark <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and brought it up. <em>They</em> <em>brought up </em>the Tent of Meeting and the holy utensils that were in it. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>King Solomon and the community were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they couldn’t keep count of them. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The priests brought the Ark to its place in the inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, under the cherubs. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They spread their wings over it and covered it and its poles. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The poles were long enough to be visible in front of the inner sanctuary, but not outside; they’re still there. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The only things in the Ark were the two tablets Moses put there at Horeb/<em>Sinai</em>, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. <strong></span>

### priests blowing trumpets. 13The singers made themselves heard to the LORD’s praise and honor, and sang out accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments. When they praised the LORD and said, “He’s good because his love endures forever,” his Temple filled with such a cloud 14the priests couldn’t carry out their service.
