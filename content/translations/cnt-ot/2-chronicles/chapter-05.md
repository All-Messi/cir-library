## 2 Chronicles Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Solomon finished the work on the LORD's Temple, he brought in the silver, gold, and utensils David had dedicated, and put them in the treasuries in God's Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Then he gathered to Jerusalem the elders in Israel, the leaders of tribes and families, in preparation for bringing up the Ark from The City of David (Zion). 3The men of Israel gathered to him at the festival in the seventh month. 4The elders came, and the Levites picked up the Ark 5and brought it up. They brought up the Tent of Meeting and the holy utensils that were in it. 6King Solomon and the community were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they couldn't keep count of them. 7The priests brought the Ark to its place in the inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, under the cherubs. 8They spread their wings over it and covered it and its poles. 9The poles were long enough to be visible in front of the inner sanctuary, but not outside; they're still there. 10The only things in the Ark were the two tablets Moses put there at Horeb/Sinai, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. 	2 Ch 5:1-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When the priests came out of the Holy Place, they'd sanctified themselves without regard to divisions. 12The Levitical singers Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres. They stood east of the altar with 120 priests blowing trumpets. 13The singers made themselves heard to the LORD's praise and honor, and sang out accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments. When they praised the LORD and said, "He's good because his love endures forever," his Temple filled with such a cloud 14the priests couldn't carry out their service. The LORD's glory filled his Temple. 	2 Ch 5:11-14</span>
