### and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 2He did what was good, but not with all his heart. 3As soon as his kingdom was firmly in hand, he executed the officials that had assassinated his father. 4He didn’t put their children to death, like the LORD commanded in the Law of Moses: “Don’t execute parents for offspring or offspring for parents. Execute each person for that person’s sin.”


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Amaziah gathered Judah and appointed them according to their families under commanders of thousands and hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin. He took a census of</span>

### and older and found 300,000 elite men, fit for war and handling spear and shield. 6He hired 100,000 trained soldiers out of Israel for 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver. 7But a man of God came to him and said, “Don’t let Israel’s army go with you; the LORD is not with Israel or Ephraim. 8Even if you go strong into the battle, God will still make you stumble in front of the enemy. He has power to help or hinder.”


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Amaziah said, <em>“But what will we do for the </em>7550 lbs <sup>100 talents</sup> <em>of silver </em><em>I’ve given </em><em>Israel’s troops</em><em>?”</em> The man of God answered, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has a lot more to give you than that.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Amaziah dismissed the troops from Ephraim, and they went home disgruntled. <strong>	</strong><strong>2 Ch</strong><strong> </strong><strong>25:1-10</strong></span>

### ,000 people from Seir. 12Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff. They threw them down to their death. 13But Israel’s troops that Amaziah sent back, raided the towns in Judah between Beth-horon and Samaria, struck down 3,000 of them, and plundered a lot of spoil.


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>After Amaziah came from slaying the Edomites, he brought the gods from Seir. He set them up as gods, bowed to them, and burned incense to them. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The LORD’s anger burned against him. He sent him a prophet, <em>“Why</em><em> seek</em><em> gods that have</em><em>n’t</em><em> delivered their own people from you?”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Ch 25:11-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>As he was talking to him, the king said, <em>“</em><em>Did we appoint</em><em> you a royal </em><em>adviso</em><em>r?</em><em> </em><em>S</em><em>hut up</em><em>!</em><em> Why get struck down?</em><em>”</em><em> </em> The prophet stopped and said, <em>“God has planned to destr</em><em>oy you because you’ve done that</em><em> and </em><em>ignored</em><em> my </em><em>advice</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Amaziah took counsel and sent to Joash (son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel), <em>“Come.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s face each other.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Joash sent back to him, <em>“A thistle in Lebanon sent to </em><em>a</em><em> cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’</em><em> </em><em>But a wild animal </em><em>in Lebanon passed by and tramp</em><em>ed </em><em>down the thistle</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> said, ‘</em><em>I’ve</em><em> defeated Edom.’</em><em> </em><em>You</em><em>’ve </em><em>become proud</em><em>. Stay home. W</em><em>hy </em><em>stir up trouble to make yourself and Judah fall</em><em>?”</em><em> </em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Ch 25:16-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>But Amaziah ignored him because it fit with the LORD’s plan to deliver them to <em>Joash</em> because they’d looked to Edom’s gods. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Joash king of Israel went up and faced Amaziah at Beth-shemesh in Judah. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He defeated Judah, and they fled to their tents. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Joash captured Amaziah at Beth-shemesh and took him to Jerusalem. He tore down the wall from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 600ft. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He took all the gold and silver, the items in God’s Temple with Obed-edom, the treasures of the king’s palace, and hostages too, and went back to Samaria.</span>

### years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. 26The rest of the acts of Amaziah, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 27From the time Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they plotted against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish, but they sent assassins after him and killed him. 28They brought him back on horses and buried him with his ancestors in The City of Davidms. 	2 Ch 25:20-28 Uzziah Rules Judah
