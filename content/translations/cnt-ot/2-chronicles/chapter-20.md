## 2 Chronicles Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After that, the Moabites, Ammonites, and some Meunites came to attack Jehoshaphat. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Some people brought him a report, <em>“A large </em><em>army</em><em> is coming out of Edom from </em><em>the other side of the sea</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’re in Hazazon-tamar </em><em>(</em><em>En-gedi</em><em>).” </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He was afraid, set himself to look to the LORD, and declared a fast throughout Judah. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Judah gathered from all the towns to look to the LORD for help.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the LORD’s Temple in front of the new court, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> our ancestors</em><em>’ God</em><em>, aren’t you God in the sk</em><em>y</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t you rule</em><em> every nation? You have such p</em><em>ower and strength</em><em> that</em><em> nobody can stand against you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Didn’t</em><em> you drive out the </em><em>people in</em><em> this land, and give it to the descendants of </em><em>Abraham</em><em> your friend </em><em>forever?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Th</em><em>ey’ve</em><em> lived in it, built </em><em>a sanctuary there for you</em><em>r</em><em> name, </em><em>and said</em><em>,</em><strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>‘Should </em><em>misfortune</em><em> come on us—the sword, judgment, </em><em>disease,</em><em> or famine—we’ll </em><em>present ourselves at this Temple</em><em> (</em><em>because your name is </em><em>here</em><em>), and call</em><em> out to you in our distress</em><em>.

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>All Judah was standing before the LORD with their infants, wives, and children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Then in the assembly, the Spirit of the LORD came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah (son of Benaiah son of Jeiel son of Mattaniah the Levite, descendant of Asaph). <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“Listen</em><em>,</em><em> Judah, </em><em>people in Jerusalem, </em><em>King Jehoshaphat</em><em>. The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says, </em><em>‘Don’t be afraid or </em><em>intimidat</em><em>ed </em><em>by</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> </em><em>big</em><em> </em><em>army</em><em>.</em><em> T</em><em>he battle is not yours but </em><em>mine</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> down against </em><em>them</em><em> tomorrow</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll</em><em> come up by the ascent of Ziz.

G</em><em>o out </em><em>to face them tomorrow; the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> with you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Jehoshaphat bowed to the ground, and Judah and the people in Jerusalem fell down in worship to the LORD. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up to give loud praise to the LORD God of Israel.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Ch 20:13-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>They got up early the next morning and went out to the Wilderness of Tekoa. As they went, Jehoshaphat stood and said, <em>“</em><em>Juda</em><em>h and Jerusalem, trust the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> and you’ll be </em><em>safe</em><em>.</em><em> Trust</em><em> his prophets and </em><em>you’ll </em><em>succeed.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When he’d advised the people, he appointed the ones that sang and praised the LORD in holy attire to go out ahead of the army, <em>“Thank the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, because</em><em> his love endures forever</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When they began singing and praising, he set ambushes against the Ammonites, Moabites, and Mount Seir; and they were routed. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The Ammonites and Moabites attacked the people from Mount Seir and destroyed them completely. When they’d finished that, they helped destroy one another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>When Judah came to the watchtower over the countryside, they looked toward the army. Corpses were lying everywhere; nobody had escaped. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found lots of equipment, clothes, and valuable things, more than they could carry. They gathered spoil for three days, there was so much of it. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>On the fourth day, they met in the Valley of Beracah to “bless” the LORD. That’s still its name. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Everyone<sup>m</sup><sup> </sup>in Judah and Jerusalem came back happy with Jehoshaphat in the lead, because the LORD made them celebrate over their enemies. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>They came to Jerusalem to the Temple with harps, lyres, and trumpets. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>All the kingdoms dreaded God when they heard that <em>he</em> had fought Israel’s enemies. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Jehoshaphat’s kingdom had peace because his God gave him rest in every direction.<strong>             </strong><strong></span>

### Summary of Jehoshaphat’s Reign

<p class="section-ref">was 35</p>

### when he became king and ruled Judah in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 32He followed the way of his father Asa. He did what was good, 33but he didn’t take away the high places. The people hadn’t yet directed their hearts to their ancestors’ God. 34The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Jehu son of Hanani and The Book of the Kings of Israel.


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>After that, Jehoshaphat allied himself with Ahaziah, king of Israel. That was a bad decision. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>He did it to build ships in Ezion-geber for going to Tarshish. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against him, <em>“Because you’ve allied yourself with Ahaziah, the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has destroyed what you’ve </em><em>built</em><em>.”</em></span>
