<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>Hezekiah</strong> became king when he</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 25</p>

### and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. 2He did what was right like David did. Hezekiah Reopens the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>In the <strong>first month of his first year</strong>, he reopened the doors of the LORD’s Temple and repaired them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the courtyard on the east. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Listen, Levites.</em><em> </em><em>C</em><em>onsecrate yourselves</em><em> and</em><em> the Temple</em><em> of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God of our ancestors</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Remove</em><em> </em><em>ceremonial </em><em>uncleanness </em><em>from</em><em> the Holy Place.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Our</em><em> </em><em>ancestors</em><em> have been unfaithful and done</em><em> what he forbids</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’ve turned their backs on </em><em>where he lives</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>They’ve</em><em> shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps.</em><em> </em><em>They</em><em> haven’t </em><em>burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> </em><em>God’s</em><em> wrath </em><em>has been</em><em> against Judah and Jerusalem</em><em>. He’s made them something to abhor</em><em>, </em><em>be amazed at</em><em>, </em><em>hissed at,</em><em> as you can see.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Our</em><em> ancestor</em><em>s </em><em>fell by the sword. O</em><em>ur sons</em><em>,</em><em> daughters</em><em>,</em><em> and wives are in captivity because of it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> </em><em>inten</em><em>d</em><em> to </em><em>renew the</em><em> covenant with the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God of Israel so his </em><em>furious</em><em> anger will turn away from us.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Sons</em><em>, don’t neglect your responsibilities any longer. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has cho</em><em>sen you to stand in his presence, perform service to him and</em> his people<em>, </em><em>and burn incense.”</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>The Levites got to work: Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites; Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the descendants of Merari; Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Shimri and Jeiel from the descendants of Elizaphan; Zechariah and Mattaniah from the descendants of Asaph;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Jehiel and Shimei from the descendants of Heman; and Shemaiah and Uzziel from the descendants of Jeduthun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>They gathered their relatives, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the LORD’s Temple like the king said by the LORD’s words. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The priests went into the inner part of the Temple to cleanse it. Everything unclean they found they brought out to the court, and the Levites carried it down to the Kidron valley. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They began the consecration on the <strong>first day, first</strong> <strong>month</strong>. On the eighth day, they went into the vestibule. They consecrated the LORD’s Temple in eight days and finished on the <strong>sixteenth</strong>. <strong>The Temple Rededicated</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, <em>“We’ve clean</em><em>sed the whole Temple, the altar for</em><em> burnt offering with </em><em>its utensils, and the table for</em><em> </em><em>the </em><em>showbread with its utensils.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>We’</em><em>ve</em><em> prepared and</em><em> consecrated the utensils King Ahaz disc</em><em>arded during his unfaithfulness. T</em><em>hey’re in front of the altar.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Then King Hezekiah got up early and gathered the city officials and went up to the LORD’s Temple. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They brought seven bulls, rams, lambs, and male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. He told the priests, descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the altar. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>They slaughtered the bulls, rams, and lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They brought the male goats for the sin offering in the presence of the king and the assembly, and laid their hands on them. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for Israel, because the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Then he stationed the Levites in the LORD’s Temple with cymbals, harps, and lyres like David, Gad the seer, and Nathan the prophet had commanded. The command came from the LORD through his prophets. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The Levites stood with David’s musical instruments and the priests with <em>their</em> trumpets. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets accompanied by David’s instruments. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang and the trumpets blew till the burnt offering finished. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Thenthe king and everybody present with him bowed in worship. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>King Hezekiah and the officials directed the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and Asaph the seer. They sang praises with joy and bowed in worship. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Hezekiah said, <em>“</em><em>Now that you’</em><em>ve consecrated yourselves, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> Temple</em><em>.”</em> The assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and everybody that wanted to brought burnt offerings. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>The assembly br</span>

### bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs as burnt offerings. 33The consecrated things were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 34There weren’t enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them till they finished and more priests had consecrated themselves. The Levites were more conscientious about consecrating themselves than the priests were. 35Besides the large number of burnt offerings, there was the fat of the peace offerings and the liquids for the burnt offerings. In that way, they restored the service in the LORD’s Temple. 36Then Hezekiah and the people celebrated what God had prepared for them, because the thing had come about suddenly.	     	2 Ch 29:31-36 Hezekiah Celebrates the Passover
