## 2 Chronicles Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hezekiah became king when he was 25 and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. 2He did what was right like David did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 29:31-36</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> In the first month of his first year, he reopened the doors of the LORD's Temple and repaired them. 4He brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the courtyard on the east. 5He said, "Listen, Levites. Consecrate yourselves and the Temple of the LORD God of our ancestors. Remove ceremonial uncleanness from the Holy Place. 6Our ancestors have been unfaithful and done what he forbids. They've turned their backs on where he lives. 7They've shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps. They haven't burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place. 8So God's wrath has been against Judah and Jerusalem. He's made them something to abhor, be amazed at, hissed at, as you can see. 9Our ancestors fell by the sword. Our sons, daughters, and wives are in captivity because of it. 10I intend to renew the covenant with the LORD God of Israel so his furious anger will turn away from us. 11Sons, don't neglect your responsibilities any longer. The LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence, perform service to him and his people, and burn incense." 	2 Ch 29:1-11</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Levites got to work:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Shimri and Jeiel from the descendants of Elizaphan;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jehiel and Shimei from the descendants of Heman; and</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They gathered their relatives, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the LORD's Temple like the king said by the LORD's words. 16The priests went into the inner part of the Temple to cleanse it. Everything unclean they found they brought out to the court, and the Levites carried it down to the Kidron valley. 17They began the consecration on the first day, first month. On the eighth day, they went into the vestibule. They consecrated the LORD's Temple in eight days and finished on the sixteenth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, "We've cleansed the whole Temple, the altar for burnt offering with its utensils, and the table for the showbread with its utensils. 19We've prepared and consecrated the utensils King Ahaz discarded during his unfaithfulness. They're in front of the altar."	2 Ch 29:15-19</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then King Hezekiah got up early and gathered the city officials and went up to the LORD's Temple. 21They brought seven bulls, rams, lambs, and male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. He told the priests, descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the altar. 22They slaughtered the bulls, rams, and lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 23They brought the male goats for the sin offering in the presence of the king and the assembly, and laid their hands on them. 24The priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for Israel, because the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then he stationed the Levites in the LORD's Temple with cymbals, harps, and lyres like David, Gad the seer, and Nathan the prophet had commanded. The command came from the LORD through his prophets. 26The Levites stood with David's musical instruments and the priests with their trumpets. 27Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets accompanied by David's instruments. 28While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang and the trumpets blew till the burnt offering finished. 29Thenthe king and everybody present with him bowed in worship. 30King Hezekiah and the officials directed the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and Asaph the seer. They sang praises with joy and bowed in worship. 	2 Ch 29:20-30</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Hezekiah said, "Now that you've consecrated yourselves, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the LORD's Temple." The assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and everybody that wanted to brought burnt offerings. 32The assembly brought 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs as burnt offerings. 33The consecrated things were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 34There weren't enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them till they finished and more priests had consecrated themselves. The Levites were more conscientious about consecrating themselves than the priests were. 35Besides the large number of burnt offerings, there was the fat of the peace offerings and the liquids for the burnt offerings. In that way, they restored the service in the LORD's Temple. 36Then Hezekiah and the people celebrated what God had prepared for them, because the thing had come about suddenly.</span>
