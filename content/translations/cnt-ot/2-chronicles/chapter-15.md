## 2 Chronicles Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded, 2and he went out to meet Asa, "Listen, Asa, Judah, and Benjamin, the LORD is with you when you're with him. If you look for him, he'll let you find him. If you leave him, he'll leave you. 3For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, without law. 4But in their distress they turned to the LORD and looked for him, and he let them find him. 5In those times, there wasn't any peace to the ones who traveled; disturbances troubled the people in many countries. 6Nation crushed nation, city crushed city, because God distressed them with all kinds of problems. 7But you, be strong. Don't lose courage; there's reward for your work."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When Asa heard Azariah's prophecy, he gathered the courage to remove the detestable idols from Judah and Benjamin and the towns he'd captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He restored the LORD's altar that was in front of the vestibule. 9He gathered Judah, Benjamin, and people from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon that lived with them; because many had defected to him from Israel when they saw the LORD was with him. 10They came together at Jerusalem in the third month of Asa's fifteenth year. 11That day they sacrificed 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep from the spoils they'd brought. 12They entered into a covenant to look to the LORD God of their ancestors with all their heart and soul. 13Whoever wouldn't look to him would be executed, man or woman, great or small. 14In addition, they shouted an oath to the LORD with trumpets and rams' horns. 15Judah celebrated the oath, because they'd sworn with all their heart and sought him earnestly, and he let them find him. The LORD gave them rest in every direction.      	2 Ch 15:1-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Asa even removed his mother Maacah from being queen mother, because she'd set up a detestable Asherah pole. Asa cut it down, pulverized it, and burned it at the Brook Kidron. 17He did not remove the high places from Israel, but his heart was blameless his whole life. 18He brought to God's Temple his and his fathers' dedicated things: silver, gold, and various items. 19There wasn't any war till his thirty-fifth year.	 2 Ch 15:16-19</span>
