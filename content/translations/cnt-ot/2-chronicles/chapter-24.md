## 2 Chronicles Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joash was 7 when he became king and ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 2He did what was good all the time Jehoiada was alive. 3Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> After that, Joash decided to restore the LORD's Temple. 5He gathered the priests and Levites, and said, "Go out to the towns in Judah and collect money to repair your God's Temple annually; do it right away." But the Levites didn't act right away. 6He summoned Jehoiada the chief priest, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax Moses laid on Israel for the Tent of Testimony?" 7The sons of Athaliah had broken into God's Temple and used the holy things for the images of Baal.	2 Ch 24:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The king had them make a chest to set outside by the gate into the Temple. 9They made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the tax Moses had levied in the desert. 10The officers and common people celebrated and brought in their levies and dropped them in the chest till they'd finished. 11Whenever the Levites saw there was a lot in the chest, they'd bring it to the king's officer, and his secretary and the chief priest's officer would empty it and take it back to its place. They did that daily and collected a lot of money. 12The king and Jehoiada gave it to the ones that serviced the Temple. They hired masons, carpenters, and artisans in iron and bronze to repair the Temple, 13and the work progressed. They restored it to its specifications and reinforced it. 14When they finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada. They made it into utensils for the Temple, for its service, the burnt offering, gold and silver pans and utensils. They offered burnt offerings continually all the time Jehoiada was alive. 	2 Ch 24:8-14</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Jehoiada died at the good old age of 130. 16They buried him in The City of David among the kings because he'd done well in Israel for God and his Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But after Jehoiada's death, the officials of Judah came and bowed to the king, and he listened to them. 18They abandoned the Temple of the LORD God and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. So wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem. 19He sent prophets to bring them back to him, but they wouldn't listen. 20Then God's Spirit of God came on Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood above the people and said, "God says, 'Why do you sin against the LORD's commands and not prosper? Because you've left him, he's left you.'" 21They plotted against him, and at the king's command stoned him to death in the Temple court; 22so Joash the king didn't remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him; he murdered his son. As he died, he said, "May the LORD see and repay you!"          	                                                                                    2 Ch 24:15-22</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> At the turn of the year, the Aramean army came up against him. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, killed the people's officials, and sent their spoil to the king in Damascus. 24Though the Arameans came with a small army, the LORD delivered a large army to them because they'd left him. They carried out judgment on Joash.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They left him seriously wounded. When they'd gone, his own officials plotted against him for murdering Jehoiada's son. They assassinated him in his bed and buried him in The City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. 26The ones that plotted against him were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 27The Commentary on the Book of the King gives accounts about his sons, the many oracles against him, and the restoration of God's Temple. His son Amaziah became king.	    2 Ch 24:23-27</span>
