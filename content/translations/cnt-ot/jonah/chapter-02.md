## Jonah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the fish's stomach,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You threw me into the deep,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> So I said, 'I've been driven away from you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Water closed in over me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I sank down to the base of the mountains;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As my life was fading away,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Those who pay respects to pointless idols</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then the LORD had the fish cough Jonah up onto the shore.</span>
