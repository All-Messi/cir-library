## Jonah Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD told Jonah son of Amittai, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> to Nineveh</em><em>,</em><em> th</em><em>at</em><em> big city, and </em><em>shout</em><em> </em><em>against it;</em><em> </em><em>I’ve seen how sinful they are</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But Jonah ran away. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He went down to Joppa, found a ship to Tarshish, paid the fare, and boarded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The LORD hurled a gale on the sea, and it was about to break up the ship. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The sailors were scared, and every man cried out to his god. They threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship. Jonah had gone below and fallen sound asleep. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The captain came and said, <em>“</em><em>How come </em><em>you’re sleeping?</em><em> </em><em>Get up, call on your god.</em><em> </em><em>Maybe he’ll be concerned about </em><em>us </em><em>enough </em><em>to keep us from</em><em> </em><em>dying</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They said to one another,<em> “Let’s cast lots to find out who </em><em>caused</em><em> this </em><em>catastrophe to hit</em><em> us.”</em><em> </em>They cast lots, and it fell on Jonah. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Tell</em><em> us, now!</em><em> Why has</em><em> this </em><em>catastrophe fallen on us</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>What’s your job?</em><em> </em><em>What’s your country?</em><em> </em><em>Wh</em><em>o are your</em><em> people?”</em><strong>     </strong></span>

### 9“I’m a Hebrew; I fear the LORD God of heaven that made the land and sea.”


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>They were really afraid, <em>“How could you do th</em><em>at</em><em>?”</em> (They knew he was running from the LORD; he’d told them.) <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>What</em><em> should we do to you to stop the</em><em> sea </em><em>from raging?” </em>It kept getting worse. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Throw</em><em> me into the sea.</em><em> I know it’s my fault this </em><em>severe</em><em> storm has come on you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>But they rowed hard, trying to get back to shore, but they couldn’t. The sea was getting even rougher. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So they called on the LORD, <em>“We earnestly pray, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, </em><em>not to let us die over</em><em> this man’s </em><em>sin</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t </em><em>hold us guilty for </em>throwing him to <em>his death</em><em>.</em><em> You’re doing what</em><em> you </em><em>wanted</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They picked Jonah up and threw him overboard, and the sea stopped raging. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They feared the LORD greatly and offered sacrifice to him and made vows. <strong>	</strong></span>
