## Jonah Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> That really made Jonah mad. 2He told the LORD, "That's exactly what I said back home and why I tried to run away to Tarshish. I knew you're a gracious, merciful God, slow to get angry and full of enduring love, and relent from bringing catastrophe. 3So take my life; I'd be better off dead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The LORD asked, "What right do you have to be mad?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. He made a lean-to and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city. 6The LORD God had a plant grow up to shade him and give him relief. He was glad to see it. 7But at dawn the next day, God had a worm attack the plant, and it withered. 8When the sun came up, God had a scorching east wind blow and the sun beat down on Jonah's head till he became faint and begged to die, "I'd be better off dead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then God asked, "What right do you have to be mad about a plant?!" 10"You're concerned about a plant you didn't plant or make grow, that came up overnight and died overnight. 11Shouldn't I be concerned about Nineveh, a big city with more than 120,000 people that don't know left from right—as well as lots of animals?"</span>
