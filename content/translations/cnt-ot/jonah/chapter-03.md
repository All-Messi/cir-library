## Jonah Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Jonah again, 2"Go to Nineveh, the big city, and deliver what I tell you." 3So he went. It was a big city, a three-days' walk-through. 4He went through it one day's walk and shouted, "God is going to overthrow Nineveh in 40 days." 5The people believed him. They called for a fast and put on burlap from least to greatest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When the message reached the king of Nineveh, he got off his throne, laid his robe aside, covered himself with burlap, and sat on ashes. 7He issued a proclamation: "In Nineveh by decree of the king and his nobles: Don't anybody—animal, herd, or flock—eat anything or drink water. 8People and animals have to wear burlap. Call on God earnestly so everyone will turn from sinfulness and violence. 9Who knows, maybe God will relent from his fierce anger and not destroy us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When God saw they'd repented, he relented from doing what he'd threatened.</span>
