## 2 Kings Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the <strong>seventh year of Jehu</strong>, <strong>Jehoash</strong> became king, and ruled for <strong>40 years in Jerusalem</strong>. His mother was Zibiah of Beersheba. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>His whole life he did what was good like Jehoiada instructed him, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>except he didn’t take away the high places. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jehoash told the priests, <em>“Let the priests take the money for</em><em> sacred things that’</em><em>s brought into the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> Temple</em><em> </em><em>and make any </em><em>repair</em><em>s on </em><em>the </em><em>Temple—</em><em>money </em><em>collected from the census, payments for vows,</em><em> and </em><em>voluntary offerings</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>By his <strong>twenty-third year</strong>, the priests <em>still </em>hadn’t made the repairs. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He said, <em>“</em><em>Why are</em><em>n’t you repair</em><em>ing</em><em> the</em><em>m? Don’t take any</em><em> more</em><em> money from your acquaintances. Hand</em><em> it</em><em> over</em><em> for the damages to the </em><em>Temple</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The priests agreed not to take any more money and to let others do the repairs.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	      </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	       </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>But Jehoiada took a chest, bored a hole in the lid, and put it on the right side the altar, where people come into the LORD’s Temple. The priests that guarded the threshold put the money in it that people brought in. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When the chest was getting full, the king’s secretary and the high priest counted it and tied it up in bags. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They weighed out the money to the ones that oversaw the Temple. They paid it to the carpenters, builders, masons, and stonecutters, <em>and</em> bought the lumber, hewn stone, and any <em>other </em>costs for the repairs. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But they didn’t make silver cups, snuffers, bowls, bugles, any gold or silver items from the money. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They gave it to the repairmen <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and didn’t require any accounting from them because they were honest. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Money from guilt offerings and sin offerings didn’t come into the Temple because it belonged to the priests.<strong>	</strong><strong>	      </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>At that time, Hazael, king of Aram, went and conquered Gath, then turned toward Jerusalem. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Jehoash/<em>Joash</em> took the sacred things that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated, along with his own sacred things and the gold in the treasuries in the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace, and sent it to Hazael. So he let Jerusalem alone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The rest of the acts of Joash/<em>Jehoash</em> are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah</em>. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>His officers led a conspiracy, and Jozacar son of Shimeath with Jehozabad son of Shomer assassinated him at Beth-millo on the way down to Silla. They buried him with his ancestors in The City of David. His son <strong>Amaziah</strong> became king.<strong>	    </strong><strong>	    </strong><strong>	    </strong></span>
