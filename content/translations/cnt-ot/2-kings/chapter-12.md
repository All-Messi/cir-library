## 2 Kings Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah of Beersheba. 2His whole life he did what was good like Jehoiada instructed him, 3except he didn't take away the high places. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on them. "Let the priests take the money for sacred things that's brought into the LORD's Temple and make any repairs on the Temple—money collected from the census, payments for vows, and voluntary offerings."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> By his twenty-third year, the priests still hadn't made the repairs. 7He said, "Why aren't you repairing them? Don't take any more money from your acquaintances. Hand it over for the damages to the Temple." 8The priests agreed not to take any more money and to let others do the repairs.							      		       2 Kg 12:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But Jehoiada took a chest, bored a hole in the lid, and put it on the right side the altar, where people come into the LORD's Temple. The priests that guarded the threshold put the money in it that people brought in. 10When the chest was getting full, the king's secretary and the high priest counted it and tied it up in bags. 11-12They weighed out the money to the ones that oversaw the Temple. They paid it to the carpenters, builders, masons, and stonecutters, and bought the lumber, hewn stone, and any other costs for the repairs. 13But they didn't make silver cups, snuffers, bowls, bugles, any gold or silver items from the money. 14They gave it to the repairmen 15and didn't require any accounting from them because they were honest. 16Money from guilt offerings and sin offerings didn't come into the Temple because it belonged to the priests.		      	2 Kg 12:9-16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> At that time, Hazael, king of Aram, went and conquered Gath, then turned toward Jerusalem. 18Jehoash/Joash took the sacred things that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated, along with his own sacred things and the gold in the treasuries in the LORD's Temple and the king's palace, and sent it to Hazael. So he let Jerusalem alone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The rest of the acts of Joash/Jehoash are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 20-21His officers led a conspiracy, and Jozacar son of Shimeath with Jehozabad son of Shomer assassinated him at Beth-millo on the way down to Silla. They buried him with his ancestors in The City of David. His son Amaziah became king.	    	    	    2 Kg 12:17-21</span>
