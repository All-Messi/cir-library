## 2 Kings Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the second year of Joash/Jehoash son of Joahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah. 2He was 25 and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. 3He did what was good, but not like David did. He did what Joash his father had done, 4but he didn't take away the high places. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on them. 5As soon as the kingdom was firmly in hand, he executed the officials that had assassinated his father. 6He didn't execute their sons, as the Law said that the LORD commanded Moses, "Don't execute parents for offspring or offspring for parents. Execute each person for that person's sin." 7He killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt, took Sela, and changed its name to Joktheel to this day.    	2 Kg 14:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He sent ambassadors to Jehoash (son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu), king of Israel, "Come; let's face each other."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jehoash, king of Israel, sent to Amaziah, "The thorn bush in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' But a wild animal in Lebanon passed by and tramped down the thorn bush. 10You've defeated Edom and become proud. Enjoy your honor and stay home. Why stir up trouble so you and Judah fall?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But Amaziah ignored him; Jehoash went up and faced Amaziah at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 12Israel defeated Judah and each man fled home. 13Jehoash captured Amaziah at Beth-shemesh, came to Jerusalem, and tore down the wall from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—600ft. 14He took the gold, silver, and utensils in the LORD's Temple and the king's treasuries, as well as hostages, and went back to Samaria.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The rest of the acts of Jehoash, the strength of his rule, and his war with Amaziah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 16He died and they buried him in Samaria with the kings of Israel. His son JeroboamII became king.	 2 Kg 14:8-16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Amaziah lived 15 years after the death of Jehoash. 18The rest of the acts of Amaziah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 19A conspiracy against him in Jerusalem caused him to flee to Lachish, but they sent assassins and killed him there. 20-21The people in Judah took his son Azariah/Uzziah and made him king at 16. 22He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, JeroboamII son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria and ruled for 41 years. 24He did evil and didn't abandon the sins of JeroboamI son of Nebat that got Israel to sin. 25He restored Israel's border from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of Arabah in keeping with the LORD's message through Jonah son of Amittai, prophet from Gath-hepher. 26The LORD saw that Israel's suffering was bitter, whether bond or free, and there was nobody to help them. 27Since the LORD hadn't yet said he'd blot out Israel, he saved them by JeroboamII.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The rest of the acts of JeroboamII, the strength of his rule, and how he fought and recovered Damascus and Hamath for Israel (cities that had belonged to Judah), are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 29He died and his son Zechariah became king.	    2 Kg 14:17-29</span>
