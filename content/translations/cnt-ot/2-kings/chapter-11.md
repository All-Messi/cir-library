## 2 Kings Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw her son was dead, she destroyed the <em>other </em>royal offspring. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But Jehosheba, King Joram’s daughter, Ahaziah’s sister, stole Ahaziah’s son Joash from the king’s sons they were killing. She hid him with his nurse in a bedroom, so he wasn’t killed. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>She hid him in the LORD’s Temple for <strong>6 years</strong> while <strong>Athaliah</strong> ruled the country.<strong>	       </strong> <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>In the <strong>seventh year</strong>, Jehoiada the priest sent for the commanders of hundreds of the Carite mercenaries together with the palace guard and brought them to the LORD’s Temple. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath. He showed them the king’s son <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and told them, <em>“</em><em>A </em><em>third of you that </em><em>go on duty</em><em> on the Sabbath and keep watch over the king’s </em><em>palac</em><em>e </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>will</em><em> </em><em>defend</em><em> the </em><em>palace </em><em>(</em><em>one-third at </em><em>gate Shur and one-third at the gate behind the guards</em><em>).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Two</em><em> parts of you </em><em>that go </em><em>on duty</em><em> on the Sabbath</em><em> </em><em>will keep watch over the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> Temple</em><em> for the king.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> surround the king</em><em> with weapons in hand.</em><em> </em><em>Put to death whoever </em><em>approaches</em><em> the ranks.</em><em> </em><em>Be with the king when he goes out and comes in.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Each commander of hundreds took his men that were to go off duty on the Sabbath, along with those that were to go on duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The priest gave the commanders King David’s spears and shields, which were in the Temple complex. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The guards stood with weapons in hand, from the south side of the Temple to the north, by the altar and by the house, around the king’s son. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He brought him out, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony. They anointed him king, clapped their hands, and said, <em>“Long live the king!”</em><strong>	     </strong> <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>When Athaliah heard the noise, she came to the LORD’s Temple. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>She saw the king standing by the pillar according to custom with the captains and buglers beside him. The people were celebrating and blowing the bugles. She tore her clothes and cried, <em>“Treason!</em><em> </em><em>Treason!”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Jehoiada told the commanders over the army,<em> “Bring her out between the ranks</em><em>. W</em><em>hoever follows her put to death with the sword</em><em>. </em><em>Don’t </em><em>execute</em><em> her in the</em><em> Temple</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They grabbed her, and when she got to the horses’ entrance at the king’s house, they put her to death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people that they would be the LORD’s people. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They tore down Baal’s temple, broke his altars and images into small pieces, and killed Mattan his priest by the altars. The priest appointed officers over the Temple. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He took the commanders of hundreds, the Carite mercenaries, the guards, and the people. They brought the king down from the Temple past the guards’ gate to the king’s palace, and he took his seat on the throne. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The people celebrated and the city grew quiet.</span>
