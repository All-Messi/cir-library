## 2 Kings Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw her son was dead, she destroyed the other royal offspring. 2But Jehosheba, King Joram's daughter, Ahaziah's sister, stole Ahaziah's son Joash from the king's sons they were killing. She hid him with his nurse in a bedroom, so he wasn't killed. 3She hid him in the LORD's Temple for 6 years while Athaliah ruled the country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> In the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest sent for the commanders of hundreds of the Carite mercenaries together with the palace guard and brought them to the LORD's Temple. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath. He showed them the king's son 5and told them, "A third of you that go on duty on the Sabbath and keep watch over the king's palace 6will defend the palace (one-third at gate Shur and one-third at the gate behind the guards). 7Two parts of you that go on duty on the Sabbath will keep watch over the LORD's Temple for the king. 8Then surround the king with weapons in hand. Put to death whoever approaches the ranks. Be with the king when he goes out and comes in."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Each commander of hundreds took his men that were to go off duty on the Sabbath, along with those that were to go on duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada. 10The priest gave the commanders King David's spears and shields, which were in the Temple complex. 11The guards stood with weapons in hand, from the south side of the Temple to the north, by the altar and by the house, around the king's son. 12He brought him out, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony. They anointed him king, clapped their hands, and said, "Long live the king!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When Athaliah heard the noise, she came to the LORD's Temple. 14She saw the king standing by the pillar according to custom with the captains and buglers beside him. The people were celebrating and blowing the bugles. She tore her clothes and cried, "Treason! Treason!" 15Jehoiada told the commanders over the army, "Bring her out between the ranks. Whoever follows her put to death with the sword. Don't execute her in the Temple." 16They grabbed her, and when she got to the horses' entrance at the king's house, they put her to death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people that they would be the LORD's people. 18They tore down Baal's temple, broke his altars and images into small pieces, and killed Mattan his priest by the altars. The priest appointed officers over the Temple. 19He took the commanders of hundreds, the Carite mercenaries, the guards, and the people. They brought the king down from the Temple past the guards' gate to the king's palace, and he took his seat on the throne. 20The people celebrated and the city grew quiet.</span>
