## 2 Kings Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the <strong>third year of Hoshea</strong>, <strong>Hezekiah</strong> son of Ahaz became king in Judah. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 25</p>

### and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abi daughter of Zechariah. 3He did what was right like David did. 4He removed the high places, broke down the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke in pieces the bronze “serpent” Moses had made, because the Israelites had been burning incense to it; they called it Nehushtan. 5He trusted in the LORD God of Israel so that no king in Judah was like him before or after. 6He held to the LORD and kept the commandments he gave Moses. 7The LORD was with him and he prospered wherever he went. He revolted against the king of Assyria 8and defeated the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its territory, from outpost to fortified city.


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>In the <strong>fourth year of King Hezekiah</strong> <strong>(</strong><strong>seventh year of </strong><strong><u>Hoshea</u></strong><strong>)</strong>, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up and laid siege to Samaria. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>At the end of three years, he captured it (<strong>sixth year of Hezekiah</strong>, <strong>ninth year of Hoshea</strong>). <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He exiled Israel to Assyria and put them in Halah, on the Habor, the Gozan River, and in towns of the Medes. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> did it</em> because they wouldn’t obey the LORD their God. They sinned against his covenant in everything Moses commanded.<strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>In the <strong>fourteenth year of King Hezekiah</strong>, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked the fortified towns in Judah and took them. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Hezekiah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, <em>“I’ve done wrong.</em><em> </em><em>Withdraw from me; whatever you impose I’ll bear.”</em><em> </em>The king of Assyria req</span>

### ⅓ tons 300 talents of silver and 1¼ tons 30 talents of gold. 15He gave him all the silver in the LORD’s Temple and the treasuries in the king’s house. 16Hezekiah cut the gold off the doors of the Temple and the doorposts he’d overlaid and gave it to him.	                                                       2 Kg 18:13-16 Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh from Lachish with a large army. They went up to Jerusalem and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller’s Field. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When they called to the king, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who managed the palace; Shebnah the secretary, and Joah son of Asah the recorder came out to them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The Rabshakeh said, <em>“Tell Hezekiah t</em><em>he great </em><em>king of Assyria</em><em> says, </em><em>‘</em><em>What’s this confidence you have?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>You</em><em>r</em><em> advice and strength for war are empty words. W</em><em>ho </em><em>are</em><em> you rely</em><em>ing</em><em> on </em><em>that you’ve rebell</em><em>ed against me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>You</em><em>’re</em><em> rely</em><em>ing on Egypt</em><em> </em><em>that </em><em>crushed reed</em><em> as a staff. I</em><em>f a</em><em>nyone</em><em> leans on </em><em>it</em><em>, it will pierce </em><em>their</em><em> hand.</em><em> That’s the way </em><em>Pharaoh </em><em>is </em><em>to everybody that relies on him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> if you </em><em>tell</em><em> me</em><em> you’re</em><em> trust</em><em>ing</em><em> in the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>y</em><em>our God, isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away and </em><em>told</em><em> Judah and Jerusalem</em><em> to w</em><em>orship </em><em>at</em><em> this altar in Jerusalem?</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>C</em><em>ome</em><em> now</em><em>, make </em><em>a deal</em><em> with my master, and I’ll give</span>

### ,000 horses if you can put riders on them. 24How can you drive off even one of my master’s least officers and rely on Egypt for chariots and cavalry? 25Haven’t I come up with the LORD’s approval to destroy this place? He told me to attack this country and destroy it.”  2 Kg 18:17-25


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Then Eliakim, Shebnah, and Joah told the Rabshakeh, <em>“Speak to </em><em>us </em><em>in Aramaic; we understand it.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in front of the people on the wall.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>But he shouted in Hebrew, <em>“Has my master sent me </em><em>just</em><em> to</em><em> you and your master to say this?</em><em> </em>Hasn’t he sent me <em>to the people </em><em>sitting </em><em>on the wall, doomed to eat their own </em><em>feces</em><em> and drink their own</em><em> </em><em>urine with</em><em> you</em><em>?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“T</em><em>he</em><em> great kin</em><em>g of Assyria says,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>‘Don’t</em><em> let Hezekiah deceive you</em><em>; h</em><em>e </em><em>can’t</em><em> deliver you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>D</em><em>on’t</em><em> let </em><em>him</em><em> make you </em><em>trust in</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, “The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will deliver us. T</em><em>his city won’t be delivered to the king of Assyria.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> listen to him</em><em>. Surrender and come out to me. Eat from your</em><em> </em><em>own grapevines and fig trees, and drink </em><em>water from </em><em>your</em><em> own cistern</em><em>s</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>till</em><em> I come and take you away to</em><em> a land like yours, with grain and new wine, bread and vineyards, </em><em>olive trees and honey so you won’t die.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>Have</em><em> any </em><em>nation’s </em><em>gods delivered </em><em>its people </em><em>from the king of Assyria?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>Where</em><em> are the gods of Hamath and Arpad</em><em>,</em><em> of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?</em><em> </em><em>Have they delivered Samaria from me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Who</em><em> among the gods of the countries have delivered them from me, that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> should deliver Jerusalem from me?’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>The people didn’t respond; the king told them not to answer him.<em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah went to Hezekiah with clothes torn and told him what the Rabshakeh had said.<strong></span>
