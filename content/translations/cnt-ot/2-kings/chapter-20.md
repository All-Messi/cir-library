## 2 Kings Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah came to tell him, "The LORD says to set your house in order; you're going to die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He turned his face to the wall and prayed, 3"Remember how I've lived in your presence honestly with all my heart. I've done what you considered good." He cried bitterly. 4Before Isaiah had left the middle court, a message came to him, 5"Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, that the LORD God of his ancestor David, says, 'I've heard your prayer and seen your tears. I'll heal you. In three days, you'll go up to my Temple. 6I'll add 15 years to your life and deliver you and this city from the king of Assyria. I'll defend it for my own honor and for David's sake.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then Isaiah told them to prepare a cake of figs and apply it to the boil. He recovered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Hezekiah said, "What's the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I'll go up to the LORD's Temple the third day?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Isaiah cried out to the LORD and brought the shadow on Ahaz's stairway back ten steps from where it had gone down.	2 Kg 20:1-11</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> At that time, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he'd heard he was sick. 13He received the ambassadors and showed them his treasure house, the silver, gold, spices, precious oil, his armor house, and everything in his treasuries. There wasn't anything in his palace or dominion that he didn't show them. 14Then Isaiah came, "What did those men say? Where did they come from?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Isaiah said, "Listen to a message from the LORD. 17The time's coming when everything in your palace that your ancestors have stored up will be carried off to Babylon. 18Some of your own sons will be taken away to become officials in the king's palace there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Hezekiah said, "The LORD's message is good." He thought to himself, "At least there'll be peace and truth while I'm alive." 20The rest of the acts of Hezekiah and the strength of his rule—how he made the pool and conduit to bring water into the city—are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 21He died and his son Manasseh became king.	 2 Kg 20:12-21</span>
