## 2 Kings Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elisha called a man from the school of the prophets, "Gird up*, take this flask of olive oil to Ramoth-gilead. 2Find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi. Tell him to get up from his companions and take him to a room inside. 3Pour the flask of olive oil on his head and say, 'The LORD says, "I've anointed you king over Israel."' Then open the door and run."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The young man went to Ramoth-gilead. 5The commanders of the army were sitting there, and he said, "I have a message for you, commander."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He got up and went into the house. The young man poured the oil on his head, "The LORD God of Israel says, 'I've anointed you king over his people Israel. 7Strike Ahab's family so I can avenge the blood of my prophets that Jezebel shed. 8Ahab's family will perish, and I'll remove from him every male, bond and free. 9I'll destroy his family like Jeroboam'sI and Baasha's. 10Dogs will eat Jezebel in Jezreel, and nobody will bury her.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jehu came out to the other officers, and one of them asked, "Is everything all right? Why did that mad fellow come to you?" He said, "He said such and such, 'The LORD says, "I've anointed you king of Israel."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Each man hurried and put his cloak under Jehu on the bare steps, blew the bugle, and said, "Jehu is king!"	 2 Kg 9:6-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jehu plotted against Joram. With all Israel, Joram had been defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael, king of Aram, 15but he'd gone back to Jezreel to heal from wounds he got from the Arameans. Jehu said, "If you agree, don't let anybody leave the city to tell it in Jezreel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Jehu rode a chariot to Jezreel because Joram was lying there healing. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come down to see Joram. 17A watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's company of soldiers, "A company is coming."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> A horseman went to meet him, "The king asks if you're coming in peace."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He sent out a second horseman, "The king asks if you're coming in peace."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The watchman reported, "He went to them, but didn't come back. His driving is furious like Jehu's."	 2 Kg 9:14-20</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Joram said, "Get my chariot ready." They got it ready. Joram and Ahaziah went out in their chariots to meet Jehu and found him on Naboth's property. 22When Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Are you coming in peace, Jehu?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Joram reined around and fled. He told Ahaziah, "It's treason!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms. The arrow went through his heart, and he sank in his chariot. 25Then Jehu told Bidkar his officer, "Pick him up and throw him on Naboth's field. Remember when we were riding behind his father Ahab, the LORD laid this oracle against him: 26'I certainly saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday. I'll pay you back on that property.' Throw him on the property like the LORD said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When Ahaziah saw that, he fled past the garden house. Jehu chased him and said, "Shoot him, too, in the chariot." They shot him at the ascent of Gur, at Ibleam. He fled as far as Megiddo and died. 28His servants hauled him to Jerusalem in a chariot and buried him in his own grave with his ancestors in The City of David. 29Ahaziah had become king in Judah in the eleventh year of Joram.	 2 Kg 9:21-29</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> When Jehu arrived at Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it, and put on eye shadow and adorned her head, and looked out the window. 31When Jehu came in the gate, she said, "Is everything all right, Zimri, your master's murderer?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He looked up at the window and said, "Who's with me?" They threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and the horses, and he tramped her under his horses hooves. 34He came in and ate, and said, "See to that cursed woman and bury her. She is a king's daughter." 35They went to bury her, but they couldn't find any of her except skull, feet, and palms. 36They came back and told him. He said, "The LORD said by Elijah, 'Dogs will eat her body on her property. 37Her corpse will be like manure on her field; people won't be able to tell if it's Jezebel.'" 	   2 Kg 9:30-37</span>
