## 2 Kings Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The school of the prophets told Elisha, <em>“There’s not enough room where we’re living</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Let</em><em> u</em><em>s go to the Jordan, and each take a </em><em>log</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>build</em><em> a place there </em><em>to</em><em> live.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Go ahead.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>One of them asked him to come along</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He went along to the Jordan, and they started cutting down trees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But as one of them was cutting down a <em>tree for a </em>beam, the axe head fell in the water. He cried out, <em>“Master!</em><em> </em><em>I borrowed</em><em> it!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The man of God said, <em>“Where did it fall?”</em> When he showed him, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Pick it up.”</em> He reached out and took it.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Elisha Traps Blinded Arameans


<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The king of Aram was at war with Israel. He advised his officers, <em>“I’m going to camp in such and such a place.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The man of God sent a message to the king of Israel, <em>“Don’t go near </em><em>that</em><em> place</em><em>;</em><em> the </em><em>Aramea</em><em>ns are coming down there.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The king of Israel sent to where the man of God told him. He warned him more than once, so he guarded himself there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The king of Aram was mad and called his officers, <em>“Who’s been an informant for</em><em> the king of Israel?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>One of the officers said, <em>“No, my lord the king! </em><em>Elisha</em><em> the prophet in Israel tells him</em><em> what you say in your bedroom.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> see where he is so I can send and capture him.”</em> He found out he was<em> </em>in Dothan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> king of Aram </em>sent horses, chariots, and a big army and surrounded the city at night.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 6:8-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When the man of God’s attendant got up early and went out, an army was circling the city with horses and chariots. He said, <em>“Master!</em><em> </em><em>What are we going to do?”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Don’tbe</em><em> afraid. T</em><em>he</em><em>re are more</em><em> with</em><em> us than with them. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Show</em><em> him, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em> The LORD let him see that the mountains all around were full of horses and flaming chariots. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When they came down to him, Elisha prayed, <em>“Strike them</em><em> with blindness.”</em> He did. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Elisha told them, <em>“This is not the way, and this is not the city.</em><em> </em><em>Follow me and I’ll take you to the man you’re looking for.”</em> He took them to Samaria.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>When they got there, Elisha said, <em>“</em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, </em><em>let</em><em> </em><em>them</em><em> see.”</em><em> </em>He let them see again that they were in the middle of Samaria. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, <em>“Father! S</em><em>hould I kill them?”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>No</em><em>.</em><em> Would you kill the ones you’</em><em>ve taken capt</em><em>ive with your sword and bow? Give them</em><em> bread and water so they can eat </em><em>and drink </em><em>and go </em><em>home </em><em>to their </em><em>master.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>He prepared a big banquet for them. When they’d eaten, he sent them away. Marauding bands from Aram never came into Israel again.<strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>As the king was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, <em>“Help, my lord the king.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He said, <em>“</em><em>If the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> doesn’t help you, where will I help you from?</em><em> </em><em>From the t</em><em>hreshing floor or the winepress?</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>What’s the matter with you?”</em> She answered, <em>“This woman said to me, ‘Give your son so we can eat him today, and we’ll eat my son tomorrow.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>e</em><em> boiled my son and ate him, and I </em><em>told</em><em> her the next day, ‘Give your son so we can eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>When the king heard it, he tore his clothes—he was passing by on the wall—and the people looked, and he had burlap under his body. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Then he said, <em>“God do so to me and </em><em>more if Elisha’s</em><em> head remains on him today.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>Elisha and the elders were sitting in his house. The king sent a man; but before he got there, <em>Elisha</em> told the elders, <em>“Do you see how this murderer</em><em>’s son</em><em> has sent to take away my head?</em><em> W</em><em>hen the messenger comes, shut the door and hold </em><em>it</em><em> shut against him.</em><em> </em><em>Is</em><em>n’t </em><em>the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>While he was still talking, the messenger came down to him, and he said, <em>“This disaster is from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. W</em><em>hy should I wait for the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> any longer?”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>
