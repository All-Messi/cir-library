<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They made a circuit of a week’s journey, and there wasn’t any water for the army or the livestock that they had with them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The king of Israel said, <em>“What are we going to do? T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>has </em><em>called these three kings to deliver them to Moab</em><em>!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But Jehoshaphat said, <em>“Isn’t t</em><em>here a prophet of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> here we can ask</em><em>?”</em><em> </em> One of the king’s officials answered, <em>“</em><em>Elisha</em><em> son of Shaphat.</em><em> </em><em>He</em><em> used to pour water on </em><em>Elijah’s</em><em> hands.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Jehoshaphat agreed, <em>“</em><em>He prophesies for the</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em> The king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Elisha told the king of Israel, <em>“Wh</em><em>y come to me</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Go to </em><em>your parents’</em><em> prophets.”</em><em> </em> <em>“No, the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> called these three kings together to deliver them to Moab</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 3:9-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Elisha said, <em>“As the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> of Hosts lives</em><em> that I </em><em>serve</em><em>, if it weren’t that I </em><em>care about </em><em>Jehoshaphat, I wouldn’t </em><em>even </em><em>look at you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>B</em><em>ring</em><em> me a m</em><em>usician</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> While the musician played, the LORD came on him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He said, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says to fill</em><em> this valley </em><em>with trenches. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou</em><em> won’t see wi</em><em>nd or rain, but the</em><em> valley will be </em><em>full of water for</em><em> you, your cattle, and</em><em> </em>other<em> </em><em>animals. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is just a little thing for the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> to deliver the Moabites to you. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> strike every fortified city, every select city, cut down every fruit tree, stop up every spring, and trash every cultivated piece of land with rocks.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>The Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight them. They called in everybody that could put on armor and stationed themselves along the border. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When they got up early, the <em>morning </em>sun was reflecting off the water. From a distance it looked red like blood. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They said, <em>“</em><em>The kings must have</em><em> fought and </em><em>killed</em><em> one another.</em><em> </em><em>Now Moab, to your spoils!”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But when they got to the camp, the Israelites rose up and struck them, and they fled. The <em>Israelites</em> advanced into the land, slaughtering the Moabites. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>They destroyed their towns, and each one threw a rock on every piece of cultivated land and trashed it. They stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees till in Kir-hareseth only they left its rocks alone. But the <em>stone </em>slingers surrounded it and attacked it. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he</span>
