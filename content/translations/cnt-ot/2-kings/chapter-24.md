### years, then revolted. 2The LORD sent bands of Babylonians, Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites against him to destroy Judah like he’d warned by his prophets. 3At the LORD’s command, that all came on Judah because of Manasseh’s sins 4and the innocent blood he’d filled Jerusalem with. The LORD wouldn’t forgive. 5The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 6He died and his son Jehoiachin became king. 7The king of Egypt didn’t come out of his country again, because the king of Babylon took everything he had from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates River. 	                                                              2 Kg 24:1-7 Jehoiachin Rules in Judah

The king of Babylon took him captive in <strong>the eighth year of his reign</strong>. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He carried the treasures out of the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace, and cut up the gold articles Solomon had made in the Temple—like the LORD said. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He led into exile Jerusalem, the commanders, trained soldiers (10,000 captives), craftsmen, and smiths. Only the poorest people remained. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He led Jehoiachin to Babylon along with his mother, his wives, officials, leading men of the country, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>the brave men (7,000), the craftsmen and smiths (1,000), the ones strong and fit for war. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He made his uncle <strong>Mattaniah</strong> king and changed his name to Zedekiah. <strong>Zedekiah Rules in Judah</strong></span>
