## 2 Kings Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Naaman, commander of Aram’s army, was a great man with his master and highly respected, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a mighty soldier, but he was a leper. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The Arameans had gone out in bands and taken captive a little girl from Israel, who became a maid for Naaman’s wife. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>She told her mistress<em>, “I wish my master would go see the prophet that’s in Samaria. </em><em>He</em><em>’</em><em>d cure his leprosy.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Naaman went in and told his master what she’d said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>The king said, <em>“Go </em><em>ahead.</em><em> I’ll send a letter to the king of Israel.”</em> He left</span>
<p class="section-ref">with 755</p>

### lbs 10 talents of silver, 150 lbs 6,000 shekels of gold, and 10 changes of clothes. 6He took the letter to king Ahab and said, “Along with this letter, I’ve sent my servant Naaman so you can cure his leprosy.”


<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When he read it, he tore his clothes, <em>“Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man is sen</em><em>ding me a message to cure a man from</em><em> leprosy?</em><em> He’</em><em>s </em><em>trying to pick a fight</em><em>.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>When Elisha heard the king had torn his clothes, he sent him a message, <em>“Why </em><em>tear</em><em> your clothes?</em><em> Send him</em><em> to me</em><em>. H</em><em>e’ll know there’s a prophet in Israel.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Naaman went with his horses and chariots, and stood at Elisha’s door. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Elisha sent his messenger to him, <em>“Go </em><em>dip</em><em> yourself seven times</em><em> </em><em>in the Jordan</em><em> </em>River<em>. Y</em><em>our flesh will be restored</em><em>,</em><em> and you’ll be clean.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Naaman was furious and left, <em>“I thought </em><em>surely</em><em> he’d </em><em>come out and call on the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> his </em><em>God, and</em><em> w</em><em>ave his hand over the place to</em><em> cure </em><em>a</em><em> leper.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Aren’t</em><em> Abanah and Pharpar, rivers of</em><em> Damascus, better than</em><em> any river in Israel? </em><em>Couldn’t I </em><em>have dipped</em><em> myself in them </em><em>to</em><em> be clean?”</em> He turned around and left in a rage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>His officers came up to him, <em>“F</em><em>ather, if the prophet had told you to do some</em><em>thing</em><em> </em><em>difficult</em><em>, wouldn’t you ha</em><em>ve done it? How much more when he </em>just <em>says to</em><em> </em><em>dip</em><em> yourself </em><em>to</em><em> be clean?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan. His flesh became like a little child’s, and he was clean.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 5:8-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>He went back to the man of God with his company, stood in front of him, and said, <em>“No</em><em>w I know there’</em><em>s no God </em><em>except in Israel. P</em><em>lease </em><em>accept</em><em> a present from </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>But <em>Elisha</em> swore, <em>“As</em><em> sure as</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives that I </em><em>serve</em><em>, I</em><em> won’t take a </em><em>thing.”</em><em> </em> He urged him to take it, but he refused.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Naaman said, <em>“If not, please let </em><em>me </em><em>at least </em><em>have</em><em> two mules’ </em><em>loads</em><em> of dirt, because </em><em>I</em><em> won’t offer burnt offer</em><em>ing or sacrifice to any god</em><em> but the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>May</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> pardon me when my master goes into Rimmon’s temple to worship and</em><em> leans on my hand and I bow</em><em> there too</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>He told him, <em>“</em><em>Have a good day</em><em>.”</em> He went away <em>to go home</em>.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 5:15-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Gehazi thought, <em>“My master</em><em> has spared this Naaman the Arame</em><em>an by not accepting what he brought.</em><em> </em><em>As </em><em>sure as </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives, I’ll run and accept something from him.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When Naaman saw somebody running after him, he got down out of the chariot to meet him, <em>“Is everything </em><em>all right</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Everything’s fine.</em><em> </em><em>My master sent me</em><em> to say that two young men from the school of the</em><em> prophets </em><em>just came</em><em> from the hill country of Ephraim.</em><em> </em><em>Please give them </em><em>75½ lbs </em><em><sup>a talent</sup></em><em> of sil</em><em>ver and two changes of clothes.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Naaman said, <em>“Please take </em><em>151 lbs </em><em><u><sup>two</sup></u></em><em><sup> talents</sup></em><em>.”</em><strong>	    </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 5:20-</p>

### 23a He urged him and put 151 lbs two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his men to carry ahead of him. 24When Gehazi got to the hill, he took them and put them in the house, and they left. 25But when he went inside, Elisha said, “Where’ve you been?” “I didn’t go anywhere.”


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><em>Didn’t</em><em> my </em><em>spirit</em><em> </em><em>go</em><em> with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you?</em><em> </em><em>Is it a time to receive money and clothes</em><em>, </em><em>olive orchards and vineyards</em><em>, </em><em>sheep and oxen</em><em>,</em><em> male and female servants?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou</em><em> and your descendants </em><em>will permanently have to cope with leprosy like Naaman’s</em>.” He went away as a leper as white as snow.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>2 Kg </strong><strong>5:23b-27</strong> <strong>The Floating Ax</strong><strong> </strong><strong>head</strong></span>
