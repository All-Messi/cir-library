## 2 Kings Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elisha said, "Listen to the LORD's message, 'Tomorrow about now, .36 bushel 1 seah of fine flour will sell for .4 oz a shekel of silver, and .73 bushel 2 seahs of barley for .4 oz a shekel in Samaria's gate.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The royal officer whose hand the king was leaning on answered, "If the LORD opened floodgates in the sky, could that be?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Four lepers were sitting at the entrance to the city gate. They talked among themselves, "Why are we sitting here till we die? 4If we go into the city, we'll starve to death. If we sit here, we'll die." 5As it was getting dark, they went to the Arameans' camp. When they got to the edge of it, nobody was there. 6The LORD had made the army hear the chariots and horses of a big army. They told one another, "The king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us." 7They ran for their lives in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses and donkeys, and the camp just like it was. 8When the lepers got to the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothes, and hid them. They went back into another tent and carried things away and hid them.         	2 Kg 7:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then they said, "What we're doing is not right. There's good news, but we're not telling it. If we wait till morning light, we'll suffer for it. Come on, let's tell the king's household."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They went and called to the city gatekeepers, "We went to the Arameans' camp, and nobody was there, not a human voice, just horses and donkeys tied up and tents standing there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The gatekeepers called out to the king's household.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The king got up during the night and told his officers, "The Arameans know we're starving; they've left camp to hide in the countryside. When we come out of the city, they'll capture us and get into the city."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> One of his officers answered, "Have some men take five of the horses left in the city. They'll be like the great number that's left in it anyway. They'll be like the big number in Israel that have already perished. Let's send and see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The king sent two chariots with horses to look for the Aramean army, 15and they tracked them to the Jordan. All along the road were clothes and equipment they'd thrown away as they fled. The messengers came back and told the king.       	2 Kg 7:9-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The people went out and plundered Aram's camp; .36 bushel 1 seah of fine flour sold for a shekel and .73 bushel 2 seahs of barley for a shekel—like the LORD had said. 17The king appointed the royal officer he depended on to take charge of the gate, but the people trampled him. He died like the man of God had said when the king came down to him: 18".73 bushel 2 seahs of barley for a shekel, .36 bushel 1 seah of fine flour for a shekel, will sell tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The royal officer had answered the man of God, "If the LORD opened the floodgates in the sky, could such a thing happen?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> That's what happened because the people trampled him to death at the gate. 2 Kg 7:16-20</span>
