## 2 Kings Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After Ahab died, Moab revolted against Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper room in Samaria and seriously injured himself. He told messengers to go ask Baal-zebub, Ekron's god, if he'd recover. 3But the angel of the LORD told Elijah the Tishbite, "Go meet the king's messengers and say, 'Are you asking Baal-zebub because there's no God in Israel?' 4So the LORD says you won't get out of bed. You'll die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When the messengers came back, he said, "Why'd you come back?" 6"A man came up to us and said to go back and tell you that the LORD says, 'Are you asking Baal-zebub because there's no God in Israel? You won't get out of bed.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The king sent him a captain with his 50 men to arrest him. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on a hill, "Man of God, the king says to come down!" 10"If I'm a 'man of God,' fire from the sky will consume you and your 50 men." That's what happened.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He sent another captain with his 50 men. "Man of God, the king says to come down now!" 12"If I'm a 'man of God,' fire from the sky will consume you and your 50 men." That's what happened.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He sent a third captain with his 50 men. When the captain came up, he knelt to Elijah, begging him, "Man of God, please value my life and the lives of these 50 servants of yours. 14Fire from the sky consumed the first two captains with their men. Regard my life as worth something to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The angel of the LORD told Elijah, "Go with him; don't be afraid of him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Elijah told Ahaziah, "The LORD says, 'Is there no God in Israel? Since you've asked Baal-zebub, you won't get out of bed.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He died, and Jehoram became king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah didn't have a son. 18The rest of his acts are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.	2 Kg 1:9-18</span>
