## 2 Kings Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the twenty-third year of Joash/Jehoash son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria and ruled for 17 years. 2He followed the sins of JeroboamI that got Israel to sin. 3The LORD's anger flared; he kept delivering them to Hazael, king of Aram, and Benhadad his son. 4Jehoahaz asked for the LORD's help and he listened to him, because he saw the oppression by the king of Aram. 5The LORD gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped from under the Arameans and lived like before. 6But they didn't turn away from the sins of JeroboamI that he got Israel to sin; the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria. 7The Arameans reduced Jehoahaz's army to not more than 50 cavalry, 10 chariots, and 10,000 infantry, and made them like dust at threshing time. 8The rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and the strength of his rule are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 9He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son Joash became king. 	                                                                                                                2 Kg 13:1-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, Joash/Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria and ruled for 16 years. 11He didn't turn away from the sins of Jeroboam that got Israel to sin. 12The rest of the acts of Joash and his strength in fighting Amaziah, king of Judah, are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 13Joash died, and they buried him in Samaria with the kings of Israel. JeroboamII sat on his throne. 	2 Kg 13:10-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When Elisha took sick with the illness he'd die from, Joash, king of Israel, came down and cried over him, "Father! Father! the chariots of Israel and their drivers!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Elisha said, "Pick up a bow and arrows, 16and put your hand on the bow." Elisha put his hands on the king's hands. 17"Open the window toward the east. Shoot! The LORD's arrow of victory over Aram! You'll destroy the Arameans at Aphek."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then he said, "Pick up some arrows and strike the floor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The man of God was mad at him, "You should have struck it five or six times. Then you would have struck Aram till you'd destroyed it. But as it is, you'll strike Aram only three times."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Elisha died, and they buried him. Bands of Moabites would invade the land in the spring. 21Once, as some Israelites were burying a man, they saw a marauding band. They threw him into Elisha's tomb and ran. When he touched Elisha's bones, he came back to life and stood up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Hazael, king of Aram, had oppressed Israel all the time of Jehoahaz. 23But the LORD was gracious, had mercy, and turned to them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He still hadn't destroyed them or thrown them out of his presence. 24When Hazael died, Benhadad his son became king. 25Jehoash took back the towns Hazael had taken in war from his father. Three times he defeated him and recovered Israel's towns.	2 Kg 13:14-25</span>
