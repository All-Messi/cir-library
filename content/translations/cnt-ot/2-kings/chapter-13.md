<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the <strong>twenty-third year of Joash</strong>/<em>Jehoash</em> son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, <u>Jehoahaz</u> son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria <em>and r</em><em>ul</em><em>ed</em> for <strong>17 years</strong>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He followed the sins of Jeroboam<strong><sup>I</sup></strong> that got Israel to sin. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The LORD’s anger flared; he kept delivering them to Hazael, king of Aram, and Benhadad his son. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jehoahaz asked for the LORD’s help and he listened to him, because he saw the oppression by the king of Aram. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The LORD gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped from under the Arameans and lived like before. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But they didn’t turn away from the sins of Jeroboam<strong><sup>I</sup></strong> that he got Israel to sin; the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The Arameans reduced Jehoahaz’s army to not more</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>When Elisha took sick with the illness he’d die from, Joash, king of Israel, came down and cried over him, <em>“Father! Father!</em><em> the chariot</em><em>s of Israel and their drivers</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Elisha said, <em>“Pick up a bow and arrows, </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> p</em><em>ut your hand on the bow.”</em> Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Open</em><em> the window toward the east. Shoot!</em> <em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> arrow of victory</em><em> over Aram! Y</em><em>ou’ll </em><em>destroy</em><em> </em><em>the Arameans at Aphek</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Then he said, <em>“Pick up some </em><em>arrows and s</em><em>trike the </em><em>floor.</em><em>”</em> He struck it three times and stopped.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The man of God was mad at him, <em>“You shoul</em><em>d have struck </em>it <em>five or six times. T</em><em>hen you would have struck </em><em>Aram</em><em> till y</em><em>ou’d </em><em>destroyed it.</em><em> </em><em>But </em><em>as it is, </em><em>you’ll strike </em><em>Aram</em><em> only three times.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Elisha died, and they buried him. Bands of Moabites would invade the land in the spring. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Once, as some <em>Israelites</em> were burying a man, they saw a marauding band. They threw him into Elisha’s tomb <em>and ran</em>. When he touched Elisha’s bones, he came back to life and stood up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Hazael, king of Aram, had oppressed Israel all the time of Jehoahaz. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But the LORD was gracious, had mercy, and turned to them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He still hadn’t destroyed them or thrown them out of his presence. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When Hazael died, Benhadad his son became king. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Jehoash took back the towns Hazael had taken in war from his father. Three times he defeated him and recovered Israel’s towns.<strong>	</strong></span>
