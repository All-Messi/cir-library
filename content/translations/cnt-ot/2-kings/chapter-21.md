## 2 Kings Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Manasseh was 12 and ruled for 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah. 2He did evil like nations the LORD originally expelled. 3He rebuilt the high places Hezekiah had destroyed, erected altars for Baal, and set up an Asherah pole like Ahab, king of Israel, had done. He worshiped and served the host of heaven, 4built altars in the LORD's Temple where the LORD had said, "I'll identify myself with Jerusalem." 5He built altars for the host of heaven in the two courts of the LORD's Temple. 6He burned his son as an offering, practiced witchcraft, used sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did so much evil and made the LORD angry. 7He put a carved image of Asherah in the Temple where the LORD told David and his son Solomon, "Forever I'll identify with this Temple and with Jerusalem, which I've chosen from the tribes of Israel. 8I won't make Israel wander anymore from the country I gave their ancestors—if only they'll observe the whole Law that I've commanded them through Moses." 	2 Kg 21:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But they didn't listen, and Manasseh seduced them to sin more than the nations the LORD originally destroyed in front of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Now the LORD spoke through his prophets, 11"Manasseh has done more disgusting things than the Amorites before him, and got Judah to sin with his idols. 12So I'm bringing such catastrophe on Jerusalem and Judah that both ears will ring of whoever hears it. 13I'll stretch over Jerusalem Samaria's measuring line and Ahab's plumb bob. I'll wipe Jerusalem like someone wipes a dish and turns it upside down. 14I'll abandon the remnant of my permanent possession and deliver them to their enemies to become plunder and spoil. 15They've done evil and made me angry ever since I brought their ancestors out of Egypt."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Besides the sin he got Judah to do, Manasseh filled Jerusalem with innocent blood from one end to the other. 17The rest of his acts and sins are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 18He died and they buried him in the garden by his palace, Uzza's garden. His son Amon became king.	2 Kg 21:9-18</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Amon was 22 and ruled for 2 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 20He did evil like Manasseh, 21followed his ways, served the idols he'd worshiped, 22and forsook the LORD God of his ancestors. 23Amon's officials plotted against him and assassinated him in his palace. 24The common people killed his assassins and made his son Josiah king. 25The rest of the acts of Amon are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 26They buried him in Uzza's garden. 	2 Kg 21:19-26</span>
