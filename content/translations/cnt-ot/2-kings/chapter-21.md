## 2 Kings Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>Manasseh</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">was 12</p>

### and ruled for 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah. 2He did evil like nations the LORD originally expelled. 3He rebuilt the high places Hezekiah had destroyed, erected altars for Baal, and set up an Asherah pole like Ahab, king of Israel, had done. He worshiped and served the host of heaven, 4built altars in the LORD’s Temple where the LORD had said, “I’ll identify myself with Jerusalem.” 5He built altars for the host of heaven in the two courts of the LORD’s Temple. 6He burned his son as an offering, practiced witchcraft, used sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did so much evil and made the LORD angry. 7He put a carved image of Asherah in the Temple where the LORD told David and his son Solomon, “Forever I’ll identify with this Temple and with Jerusalem, which I’ve chosen from the tribes of Israel. 8I won’t make Israel wander anymore from the country I gave their ancestors—if only they’ll observe the whole Law that I’ve commanded them through Moses.” 	2 Kg 21:1-8


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>But they didn’t listen, and Manasseh seduced them to sin more than the nations the LORD <em>originally</em> destroyed in front of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Now the LORD spoke through his prophets,<strong><sup> </sup></strong> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Manasseh</em><em> has done mor</em><em>e </em><em>disgusting things</em><em> than the Amorites before </em><em>him</em><em>,</em><em> and</em><em> </em><em>got Judah to </em><em>sin</em><em> with his idols.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> </em><em>I’m bringing such </em><em>catastrophe</em><em> on Jerusalem and Judah that both e</em><em>ars will ring</em><em> </em><em>of</em><em> </em><em>whoever hears it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> stretch over Jerusalem </em><em>Samaria’s</em><em> </em><em>measuring line and Ahab’s plumb bob. </em><em>I’ll wipe Jerusalem like </em><em>someone</em><em> wipes a dish and turns it upside down.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> abandon the </em><em>remnant</em><em> of my </em><em>permanent possession</em><em> an</em><em>d deliver them to their enemies to</em><em> become plunder and spoil</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>hey’ve</em><em> done evil and </em><em>made me</em><em> an</em><em>gry</em><em> </em><em>ever </em><em>since </em><em>I brought</em><em> their ancestors </em><em>out of Egypt.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Besides the sin he got Judah to do, Manasseh filled Jerusalem with innocent blood from one end to the other. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The rest of his acts and sins are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah.</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He died and they buried him in the garden by his palace, Uzza’s garden. His son Amon became king.<strong>	</strong></span>
