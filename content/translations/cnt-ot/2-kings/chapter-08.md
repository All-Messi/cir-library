## 2 Kings Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Elisha told the woman whose son he’d revived, <em>“</em><em>Take</em><em> your </em><em>family</em><em> and </em><em>live temporarily wherever you can. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has called for a </em><em>seven-year </em><em>famine</em><em> here</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They went to stay with the Philistines. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Seven years later, she came back and appealed to the king for her house and farm. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He was talking to Gehazi, the man of God’s servant, <em>“Tell me the great things Elisha has done.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>As he was telling him how he’d restored life to <em>a boy</em>, she appealed to the king for her house and farm. Gehazi said, <em>“My lord the king, </em><em>that’</em><em>s the woman</em><em>, and that’s her son!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When the king asked her, she told him about it. He appointed an officer to give her back everything, including the crops since she left.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Elisha went to Damascus. Benhadad, king of Aram, was sick and heard that the man<em> </em>of God was there<em>.</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He told Hazael, <em>“Take </em><em>him </em><em>a gift</em><em> and ask</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> by him</em><em> if I’ll</em><em> recover</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Hazael went to meet him with a gift, every kind of good thing in Damascus—40 camel loads. He stood in front of him and said, <em>“Your son Benh</em><em>adad</em><em>,</em><em> king of </em><em>Aram,</em><em> has sent me to ask</em><em> you if he’ll recover from his sickness.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Elisha said,<em> “</em><em>He’ll recover,</em><em> but the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has shown me that he’ll certainly die.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He stared at him till he was embarrassed, and the man of God cried.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Hazael said, <em>“Why</em><em> are you</em><em> crying</em><em>, Sir</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Because I know</em><em> the terrible things you’ll do to </em><em>Israel.</em><em> </em><em>You’l</em><em>l set their fortresses on fire,</em><em> kill</em><em> their young men with the sword,</em><em> dash their little ones </em><em>to pieces, and</em><em> rip </em><em>open</em><em> their </em><em>pregnant </em><em>women.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em> am </em><em>I</em><em>, </em><em>a</em><em> dog</em><em>, to do </em><em>thing</em><em>s like that</em><em>?”</em> Elisha answered, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has shown me that you’ll be king o</em><em>f</em><em> </em><em>Aram</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He went back to his master, who said, <em>“What did Elisha say to you?”</em><em> </em> <em>“He </em><em>said</em><em> you</em><em>’d</em><em> recover.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The next day <em>Hazael</em> dipped a blanket in water and pressed it over Benhadad’s face to kill him. Hazael became king.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Jehoram Rules in Judah


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>In the <strong>fifth year of </strong><u>Joram</u>/<em>Jehoram </em>son of Ahab, king of Israel—<em>who ruled at the time of </em>Jehoshaphat, king of Judah—<strong>Jehoram</strong> son of Jehoshaphat became king. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 32</p>

### and ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 18He followed Israel’s kings like Ahab had done because he’d married Ahab’s daughter. He did evil, 19but for David’s sake the LORD wasn’t willing to destroy Judah. He’d promised to always give him a lamp through his descendants.


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>During his reign, Edom revolted from Judah and appointed a king. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Joram and his chariots crossed over to Zair. He got up at night and struck at the Edomites that had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots, but his army fled to their tents. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Edom has been in revolt against Judah ever since. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The rest of the acts of Joram/<em>Jehoram</em> are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah</em>. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Ahaziah became king. <strong>	</strong></span>

### Ahaziah Rules in Judah


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>In the <strong>twelfth year of </strong><u>Jora</u><u>m</u><em>/</em>Jehoram son of Ahab, king of Israel, <strong>Ahaziah</strong> son of Jehoram began to rule. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 22</p>

### and ruled for 1 year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel. 27He did evil like Ahab’s family had done because he was Ahab’s son-in-law. 28He went to war along with Joram against Hazael, king of Aram in Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded him. 29King Joram came back to Jezreel to heal up. Then Ahaziah went down to see Joram because he’d been wounded.	2 Kg 8:25-29 Jehu Anointed King in Israel
