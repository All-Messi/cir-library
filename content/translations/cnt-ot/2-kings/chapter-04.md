<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The wife of a man from the company of prophets cried out to Elisha, <em>“</em><em>M</em><em>y husband</em><em>’</em><em>s dead.</em><em> </em><em>You know </em><em>how he</em><em> </em><em>respect</em><em>ed the LORD.</em><em> </em><em>A creditor has come to take my two children </em><em>as </em><em>his slaves.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>What</em><em> can I do</em><em>?</em><em> W</em><em>hat </em><em>do you have in the house?</em><em>”</em><em> </em> <em>“</em><em>No</em><em>thing </em><em>but a jug</em><em> of oil.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>He said, <em>“B</em><em>orrow </em><em>containers</em><em> from your neighbors</em><em>—not</em><em> just a few.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> and your sons go in and shut the door</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Pour </em>the oil<em> </em><em>into those containers and set the </em><em>full</em><em> ones aside</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>She went in and shut the door. They brought her the containers, and she poured <em>out the oil</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When they were full, she told her son, <em>“Bring me another </em><em>one</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> He said, <em>“There aren’t any more.”</em> The oil stopped.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>She went and told the man of God. He said, <em>“S</em><em>ell the oil </em><em>to</em><em> pay your </em><em>debt. Y</em><em>ou and your sons can </em><em>us</em><em>e the rest.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### The Shunammite’s Son Resurrected


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Elisha passed over to Shunem, where a well-to-do woman lived. She persuaded him to eat<em> there</em>. So, whenever he went by, he’d stop there to eat. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>She told her husband, <em>“I sense that this is a holy man of God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Let’s</em><em> </em><em>build</em><em> a </em><em>small</em><em> upper </em><em>room</em><em> </em><em>with walls,</em><em> </em><em>and pu</em><em>t a bed, table</em><em> and</em><em> chair, and lampstand </em><em>in there </em><em>for him.</em><em> </em><em>When he comes, he can turn in there.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>One day he came and turned in to the upper room and rested. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He told Gehazi his servant to call the Shunammite. When she came, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Elisha</em><em> </em>told him to tell her,<em> “</em><em>You’ve taken care of us </em><em>so often. W</em><em>hat can I do for you?</em><em> Do</em><em> you </em><em>want me to </em><em>sp</em><em>eak to the king or</em><em> the </em><em>commander</em><em> of the army</em><em> for you</em><em>?”</em> She answered, <em>“I live among my own people.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He asked Gehazi, <em>“What can we do for her?”</em> <em>“She doesn’t have a son</em><em>,</em><em> and her husband is </em><em>elderly</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“Call</em><em> her.”</em> She came to the doorway. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He said, <em>“At this time next year, you’ll be holding a son.”</em> <em>“</em><em>Man of God,</em><em> d</em><em>on’t </em><em>give me false hope!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>She did get pregnant and had a son at that time the next year.<strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>When the boy was growing up, he went out to his father and the harvest crew one day, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and told him, <em>“</em><em>My head hurts!</em><em> my head</em><em> hurts!</em><em>”</em> He told his servant, <em>“Carry him to his mother.”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When he got him to her, the boy sat on her lap till noon and died. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>She went up and laid him on the man of God’s bed, shut the door, and went out. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>She called her husband, <em>“</em><em>S</em><em>end me </em><em>a</em><em> servant and a donkey so I can </em><em>go quick</em><em> to the man of God and back.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“Why</em><em> go to him today?</em><em> </em><em>It’s not a new moon or Sabbath.”</em> She said, <em>“It’</em><em>ll be </em><em>good</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>She saddled the donkey and told her servant, <em>“</em><em>Drive the animal! D</em><em>on’t slow down unless I tell you.”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>She went to the man of God on Mount Carmel. When he saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi, <em>“Th</em><em>at</em><em>’s the Shunammite.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Run</em><em> and ask her if she and her husband and boy are all right.”</em><em> </em> She answered, <em>“Yes.”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>When she came to the man of God on the hill, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came to pull her away, but he said, <em>“Let her alone; she’s </em><em>upset.</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> hasn’t revealed it to </em><em>me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>She said, <em>“Did I ask </em><em>you </em><em>for a son?</em><em> </em><em>Didn’t I say</em><em> not to</em><em> </em><em>give me false hope</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>He told Gehazi, <em>“Gird up</em><em>*</em><em>, take my staff, and go.</em><em> D</em><em>on’t greet </em><em>anybody. I</em><em>f anybody greets you, don’t answer.</em><em> </em><em>Lay my staff on the boy’s face.”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>The mother swore, <em>“As </em><em>sure as </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives and you live, I won’t leave </em><em>without </em><em>you.”</em><em> </em>He went along. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but he didn’t make a sound or respond. <em>Gehazi</em> went back and told him, <em>“The boy hasn’t woken</em><em> up.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong>When Elisha went into the house, the boy was dead on the bed. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He went in, shut the door, and prayed to the LORD. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He went and lay down on the child, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands, and stretched out on him. The child’s body got warm. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>He came back and paced back and forth in the house, and went up and stretched out on him <em>again</em>. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>He called Gehazi, <em>“</em><em>Call her</em><em>.”</em> When she came in, he said, <em>“Pick up your </em><em>boy</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>She fell at his feet and bowed to the floor. She picked up the boy and went out.</span>

### The Toxic Gourds


<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>When Elisha got back to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As men from the company of prophets were sitting with him, he told <em>Gehazi</em>, <em>“Put on </em><em>a</em><em> large pot and </em><em>heat</em><em> stew for the</em><em>m</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>One of them went out into the field to gather plants, found a wild vine, and gathered his lap full of gourds from it. He came and sliced them into the pot of stew. They didn’t know <em>what they were</em>. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>They poured it out for the people to eat. After they’d eaten a little, they cried out, <em>“</em><em>Man of God, there’s poison in this stew!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Bring some</em> <em>meal.”</em> He threw it into the pot and said, <em>“Pour it out for the people </em><em>to eat</em><em>.”</em>  Then there wasn’t anything harmful in it. <strong>Bread for a Hundred Men</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>A man came from Baal-shalishah and brought the man of God bread in a sack from the first fruit of his harvest:<em> </em>20 barley loaves made from fresh grain. <em>Elisha</em> said, <em>“Give them to the people to eat.”</em> <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>His attendant said, <em>“</em><em>What? How can</em><em> I </em><em>feed</em><em> </em><em>100</em><em> men</em><em> with this</em><em>?”</em> But he said, <em>“Give </em><em>it</em><em> to the</em><em>m; the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says they’ll eat and have some left over.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong>He set it in front of them, and they ate and had some left over.<strong>	 </strong></span>
