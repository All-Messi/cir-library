## 2 Kings Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with burlap, and went into the LORD's Temple. 2He sent Eliakim with Shebna and the elders of the people, covered with burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 3They told him, "Hezekiah says, 'Today is a time of distress, rebuke, and rejection. Babies have come to term, but there's no strength to deliver them. 4Maybe the LORD your God will hear the message from the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria has sent to disparage the living God. Maybe he'll rebuke what he's heard. Pray for the remnant that's left.'" [5]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Isaiah said, "Tell your master, 'The LORD says, "You don't have to be afraid of what the Assyrian king's messengers have blasphemed. 7I'll put a spirit in him that makes him hear a rumor and go back to his country. He'll fall by the sword in his own land."'"	2 Kg 19:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The Rabshakeh went back and found the king of Assyria fighting Libnah, because he'd heard that the king had left Lachish. 9When he heard them say that Tirhakah [Taharqa], king of Nubia, had set out to fight him, he sent messengers back again to Hezekiah, 10"Tell Hezekiah, 'Don't let the god you trust in deceive you by saying Jerusalem won't be delivered to the king of Assyria. 11You've heard that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries. Are you going to be spared? 12Did their gods deliver Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, the sons of Eden in Telassar? 13Where's the king of Hamath, Arpad, or the towns Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Hezekiah read the letter, went up to the LORD's Temple, and spread it out to him. 15He prayed, "LORD God of Israel Enthroned Above the Cherubs, you alone are God over the kingdoms. You made earth and sky. 16Incline your ear and hear; open your eyes and see. Listen to what Sennacherib has sent to disparage the living God. 17Assyria's kings have devastated the nations and their lands. 18They've burned their gods because they weren't gods, just man-made pieces of wood and stone. 19But now, LORD our God, deliver us from him so the kingdoms can know that you alone are God."	 2 Kg 19:8-19</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Isaiah sent to Hezekiah, "The LORD says, 'Because you've prayed about Sennacherib, I've listened.' 21This is what the LORD says against him:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Who have you disparaged and blasphemed?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> By your ambassadors you've disparaged the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I dug wells and drank foreign water;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> From ancient times I've known</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Because you've raged against me, 29'This will show you what I mean: this year you'll eat what volunteers, next year what sprouts from that, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat what they produce. 30The surviving remnant of Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. 31A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD will make that happen. 32'The LORD says the king of Assyria won't come to this city or shoot an arrow here. He won't approach it with a shield or build a mound against it. 33He'll go back the way he came. 34I'll save this city for my own sake and for David's sake."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> That night the angel of the LORD struck 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up early, the Assyrians were all dead. 36Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 37As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to Ararat. His son Esarhaddon became king. 	2 Kg 19:29-37</span>
