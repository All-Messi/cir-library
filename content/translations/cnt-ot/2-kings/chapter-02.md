## 2 Kings Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD was getting ready to take Elijah up in a tornado. Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and told him, <em>“Stay</em><em> here</em><em>. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has sent me </em><em>to</em><em> Bethel.”</em><em> </em> <em>“As </em><em>sure as </em><em>th</em><em>e </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives and you live, I won’t </em><em>leave you.”</em> They went down to Bethel. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The company of prophets in Bethel came out to Elisha, <em>“</em><em>Do you know the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> going to</em><em> take your master </em><em>away </em><em>today?”</em> <em>“</em><em>Yes, I know.</em><em> </em><em>Keep it to yourselves</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Elijah told him, <em>“</em><em>Stay</em><em> here</em><em>. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has sent me to Jericho.”</em><em> </em> <em>“As </em><em>sure as </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives and </em><em>you live, I</em><em> won’t </em><em>leave you.”</em> They went on to Jericho. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The company of prophets in Jericho came to Elisha, <em>“Do you know the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’</em><em>s</em><em> going to take your master </em><em>away </em><em>today?”</em> <em>“Yes, I know.</em><em> </em><em>Keep it to yourselves</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Elijah told him. <em>“Stay here. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has sent me to the Jordan.”</em><em> </em> He said, <em>“As </em><em>sure as </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives and you li</em><em>ve, I won’t</em><em> </em><em>leave </em><em>you.”</em> They continued on.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong> <strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Fifty men from the company came and stood at a distance on the other side <em>of the Jordan </em>while the two of them stood on this side. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water. It separated from one side to the other, so the two of them crossed on dry riverbed. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then Elijah asked Elisha, <em>“What </em><em>should </em><em>I </em><em>do for you before I</em><em> leave?</em><em>”</em> <em>“Pu</em><em>t a </em><em>double portion of your spirit</em><em> on me.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“You’re</em><em> asking</em><em> </em><em>for a lot</em><em>.</em><em> But if you see me when </em>the LORD’s<em> taking me away, your request will happen. If you don’t, it won’t</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>As they went along talking, a flaming chariot with flaming horses appeared and separated them. Elijah ascended to the sky in a tornado. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Elisha saw it and cried out, <em>“Father! Father! T</em><em>he chariot</em><em>ry </em><em>of Israel</em><em> and its drivers</em><em>!”</em><em> </em>He never saw him again. He tore his clothes, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>picked up the mantle that Elijah had dropped, and went back to the Jordan. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He struck the water with it and said, <em>“Where’s the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, Elijah’s </em><em>God?”</em> The water separated from one side to the other, and he went <em>back </em>across.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The school of the prophets in Jericho saw what happened, <em>“</em><em>Elijah</em><em>’s spirit</em><em> </em><em>is resting</em><em> on Elisha.”</em><em> </em>They came to meet him and bowed to the ground, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Please</em><em> let these fifty strong men</em><em> </em><em>go look</em><em> for your master.</em><em> Maybe</em><em> </em><em>the</em><em> </em><em>wind from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has taken him up and </em><em>dropped</em><em> him on some </em><em>mountain or in some </em><em>valley.”</em> He said, <em>“Don’t do that</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They urged him till he felt embarrassed, <em>“Go ahead</em><em>, then</em><em>.”</em> They sent</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Then the men in the city told Elisha, <em>“</em><em>T</em><em>his city is </em><em>a nice place to live in, as you can see, but the water’</em><em>s bad and the ground</em><em> causes barrenness</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Bring me a new j</em><em>ug</em><em> and put salt in it.”</em><em> </em> They brought one, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>and he went out to the spring and threw the salt in it, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says he’s purified the</em><em> water.</em><em> It won’t cause death or barrenness anymore</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The water is still pure.<strong>	</strong> <strong>Forty-Two Youths Jeer Elisha</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	                 </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
