## 2 Kings Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD was getting ready to take Elijah up in a tornado. Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal 2and told him, "Stay here. The LORD has sent me to Bethel." "As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won't leave you." They went down to Bethel. 3The company of prophets in Bethel came out to Elisha, "Do you know the LORD's going to take your master away today?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Kg 2:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Elijah told him, "Stay here. The LORD has sent me to Jericho." "As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won't leave you." They went on to Jericho. 5The company of prophets in Jericho came to Elisha, "Do you know the LORD's going to take your master away today?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Elijah told him. "Stay here. The LORD has sent me to the Jordan." He said, "As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won't leave you." They continued on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Fifty men from the company came and stood at a distance on the other side of the Jordan while the two of them stood on this side. 8Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water. It separated from one side to the other, so the two of them crossed on dry riverbed. 9Then Elijah asked Elisha, "What should I do for you before I leave?" 10"You're asking for a lot. But if you see me when the LORD's taking me away, your request will happen. If you don't, it won't."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As they went along talking, a flaming chariot with flaming horses appeared and separated them. Elijah ascended to the sky in a tornado. 12Elisha saw it and cried out, "Father! Father! The chariotry of Israel and its drivers!" He never saw him again. He tore his clothes, 13picked up the mantle that Elijah had dropped, and went back to the Jordan. 14He struck the water with it and said, "Where's the LORD, Elijah's God?" The water separated from one side to the other, and he went back across.	2 Kg 2:7-14</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The school of the prophets in Jericho saw what happened, "Elijah's spirit is resting on Elisha." They came to meet him and bowed to the ground, 16"Please let these fifty strong men go look for your master. Maybe the wind from the LORD has taken him up and dropped him on some mountain or in some valley." He said, "Don't do that." 17They urged him till he felt embarrassed, "Go ahead, then." They sent the 50 men, who searched for three days without finding him. 18They came back while Elisha was at Jericho.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then the men in the city told Elisha, "This city is a nice place to live in, as you can see, but the water's bad and the ground causes barrenness."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He said, "Bring me a new jug and put salt in it." They brought one, 21and he went out to the spring and threw the salt in it, "The LORD says he's purified the water. It won't cause death or barrenness anymore." 22The water is still pure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> As he was climbing the road from there to Bethel, some young boys came out of the city to taunt him, "Ascend, baldy! Ascend, baldy!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When he looked back, he put a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Two female bears came out of the woods and mauled 42 of them. 25He went on from there to Mount Carmel and then back to Samaria.	 2 Kg 2:15-25</span>
