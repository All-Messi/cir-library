## Joel Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A Message from the LORD to Joel Son of Pethuel <strong>Mourning over a Locust Invasion</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Listen to this, elders; pay attention, everybody in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your lifetime or your ancestors’ lifetime?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Tell your descendants about it; they need to tell <u>their</u> descendants, and so on. <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 1:1-</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>What the cutting locusts left the swarming locusts have eaten. What the swarming locusts left the hopping locusts have eaten. What the hopping locusts left the stripping locusts have eaten.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Wake up, you drunks, and cry; wail, wine drinkers, for the sweet wine you can’t find anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>A nation has invaded my land, powerful and without number. Its teeth are like a lion’s teeth; it has fangs like a lioness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>It’s destroyed my grapevines and ruined my fig trees. It’s stripped off their bark and thrown it away, so their branches are bare and white.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 1:4-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Wail like a virgin wearing burlap for her young groom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The grain offerings and liquid offerings have stopped in the LORD’s Temple. The priests, the LORD’s ministers, mourn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>The fields are ruined, the land is bare because the grain has been destroyed, the new wine has dried up, the fresh oil has failed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Despair, farmers; wail, vinedressers, for the wheat and barley; the harvest is ruined.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>The grapevines have shriveled up, the fig trees have withered; the pomegranate, palm, and apple trees as well. The fruit trees in the orchard have dried up, the joy among the people too.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 1:8-12</p>

### A Call to Repentance


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Put on burlap and chant a dirge, priests; wail, ministers at the altar! Come, spend the night in burlap, ministers of God, because the grain offerings and liquid offerings have stopped in his Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Consecrate a fast, declare a solemn assembly; gather the elders and the people to the LORD’s Temple, and cry out to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Dread the day! The day of the LORD is upon us, a day of destruction that’s coming from the Almighty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Hasn’t food disappeared in front of us, and happiness left the Temple?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Seeds shrivel under the clods; barns stand empty; granaries are abandoned because the crops have failed.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 1:13-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The cattle are bawling! Herds are wandering aimlessly because there’s no pasture; flocks of sheep are bleating in misery.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>I’m calling out to you, LORD, because fire has burned off the open range; flames have burned up the trees in the fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Even the wild animals pant for you because the streams have dried up and fire has scorched the pastures.</span>
