## Joel Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 2I'll gather the nations to the Valley of Jehoshaphat and condemn them there on behalf of Israel, my permanent possession, my people. They scattered them among the nations, divided up my land, 3cast lots for my people, traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine to get drunk on. 4"What are you to me, Tyre, Sidon, Philistia? You think you're going to pay me back? If you try, I'll return it on your head swift and soon. 5You've stolen my silver and gold, taken my precious treasures into your temples, 6and sold Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks to remove them far away. 7So I'm going to raise them up from where you sold them and pay you back on your own head. 8I'll sell your sons and daughters to Judah to sell to the Sabeans far away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Declare this among the nations:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Beat your plowshares into swords,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Come quickly, nations everywhere;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Use the sickle; the harvest is ripe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Thousands upon thousands in the valley of decision!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The sun and moon will grow dark;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The LORD will roar out of Zion;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then you'll know I'm the LORD your God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Egypt will be a wasteland</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But people will live in Judah forever,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I'll avenge their blood that I haven't already avenged</span>
