## Joel Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Blow a bugle in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let the people in the land tremble because the day of the LORD is coming. It’s near,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>a dark and gloomy day, a cloudy day with deep blackness. A numerous, powerful army is spreading out like shadows in the mountains. There’s never been anything like them before, and there won’t be for ages to come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Fire consumes ahead of them; flames burn behind them. The land is like the Orchard of Eden in front of them, but desolation <em>lies </em>behind them; nothing escapes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>They look like horses; they run like steeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>With rumbling like chariots, they leap along on the hilltops— like a crackling flame consuming stubble, like a powerful army in battle formation.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 2:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Defenders are in anguish in front of them with faces turned pale.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>They run like warriors and scale walls like soldiers; they march in line without breaking rank.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>They don’t bump into one another; each one marches straight ahead. When they break through the defenses, they just keep going.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>They rush at the city and run along its walls; they climb into houses through windows like thieves. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong> The ground quakes in front of them, the sky shakes, the sun and moon go out, the stars grow dim.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 2:6-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The LORD raises his voice in front of his army; his camp is large because he’s strong that carries out his word. The day of the LORD is terrifying; who can survive it? <strong>A Call to Repentance</strong> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Yet even now,”</em> the LORD says, <em>“come back to me with all your heart,</em> <em>	with fasting, tears, and mourning.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>Tear you hearts, not your </em><em>clothe</em><em>s.”</em> Come back to him; he’s gracious and merciful, slow to get angry, full of enduring love, and relents from carrying out destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Who knows if he’ll relent and leave behind a blessing for you, the possibility of offering again a grain offering and a liquid offering for the LORD your God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 2:11-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Blow a bugle in Zion, consecrate a fast, declare a solemn assembly,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>bring the people together, sanctify the community, assemble the elders, gather the children and nursing infants. Have the groom come out of his room and the bride leave her quarters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Let the priests, the LORD’s ministers, weep between the porch and altar. Let them say, <em>“Spare your people, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em> <em>	</em><em>D</em><em>on’t make your </em><em>permanent possession</em><em> a </em><em>disgrace</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	a byword </em><em>the world over</em><em>.</em> <em>	Why should they say,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>‘Where’s their God?</em><em>’</em><em>”</em></span>

### :15-17 The Lord Promises Restoration


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Then the LORD will become zealous for his land and take pity on his people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>He’ll answer them, <em>“I’m going to send you grain, new wine, and </em><em>olive </em><em>oi</em><em>l</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>you’ll be satisfied.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>I’ll never again make you a byword </em><em>the world over</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>I’ll remove the northern threat far from you</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>and drive </em><em>him</em><em> into a parched</em><em>,</em><em> desolate land.</em> <em>	</em><em>	I’ll drive his vanguard </em><em>into the </em><em>Dead Sea</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	his </em><em>rear guard into the </em><em>Mediterranean</em><em>. </em> <em>	</em><em>	The</em><em> stench </em><em>from rotting bodies </em><em>will rise</em><em> over the land.”</em> The Lord has done great things!<em> </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 2:18-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Don’t be afraid, O land; celebrate and be happy because the LORD has done great things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Don’t be afraid, animals in the field, because the pastures in the countryside have turned green. The trees have borne their fruit; the fig tree and vine have given their full yield.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>So celebrate, people of Zion; be happy in the LORD your God because he’s given you the autumn rains to vindicate you. He has poured down rain for you, the autumn and spring rains like before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>The threshing floor will be full of grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and olive oil. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong> <em>“Then I’ll make up to you for the years</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>the swarming locusts, </em><em>crawl</em><em>ing locust</em><em>s</em><em>, </em> <em>	</em><em>	stri</em><em>pping locusts, and</em><em> cutting locusts</em><em> have eaten</em><em>—</em> <em>	the enormous army I sent at</em><em> you.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><em>You’ll ha</em><em>ve plenty to eat;</em> <em>	</em><em>praise the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God,</em> <em>	</em><em>	who has dealt with you</em><em> amazing</em><em>ly;</em> <em>	</em><em>	then </em><em>you’ll</em><em> never be </em><em>disgraced</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup><em><u>That’s how you’ll know</u></em><em> </em><em>I’m in the land,</em> <em>	</em><em><u>that I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em><u> your God</u></em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and there</em><em>’s no </em><em>other.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Joel 2:21-27</p>

### The LORD Promises His Spirit 28“After that, I’ll pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people: 	sons and daughters will prophesy, 	old men will dream dreams, 	young men will see visions.


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup><em>I’ll even pour out my Spirit </em> <em>	on male and female servants.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup><em>I’ll display wonders in the sky and on the earth:</em> <em>	blood, fire, and columns of smoke.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup><em>The sun will turn dark, and the moon will turn red</em> <em>	before that great, notable day of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>At that time, he’ll save whoever calls on him. On Mount Zion and in Jerusalem people will escape like the LORD said; among the survivors will be the people the LORD calls. <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
