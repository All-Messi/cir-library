## Amos Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to the dirge I'm chanting for you, Israel:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The city that goes out 1,000 strong</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The LORD tells Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Don't rely on Bethel or go to Gilgal or Beersheba;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Rely on me so you can live,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The LORD is the One that made Pleiades and Orion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He's the One that flashes destruction at the strong</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They hate the one that reproves in court;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So, since you impose heavy rent on the poor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I know about your many, serious sins,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In such cases, prudent people keep quiet</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Do what's good so you can live,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Hate evil, love good;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So, the LORD God of Hosts says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> In all the vineyards there'll be wailing</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> What longing you have for the day of the LORD!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> It will be like a man that runs from a lion</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Won't the day of the LORD be darkness instead of light,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Though you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Take away your noisy songs;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Instead, make justice run down like water 25"Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings in the desert for 40 years, Israel? 26Well, you also carried along Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god, images you made for yourselves. 27So I'll send you into exile beyond Damascus," the LORD says, whose name is The God of Hosts.</span>
