<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The LORD has sworn by Jacob's arrogance,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> At that time, I'll make the sun go down at noon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'll turn your festivals into mourning</span>
