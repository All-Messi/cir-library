## Amos Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to what the LORD says against you, Israel, against the entire family he brought out of Egypt:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Can two men walk together unless they've agreed on their route?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Does a lion roar in the woods before it's made a kill?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground if there's no bait in it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> If a bugle blows in the city, won't the people be afraid?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> For certain the LORD God doesn't do anything</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A lion has roared! Who's not afraid?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Declare on the fortresses in Ashdod and Egypt: "Gather in the mountains around Samaria and watch the great turmoil and oppression in it. 10They don't know how to do what's right; they store up violence and devastation in their fortresses."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So the Lord GOD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Like a shepherd snatches from a lion's mouth</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Listen and testify against Jacob's house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When I punish Israel's sins, I'll punish Bethel's altars too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll strike their winter palaces and summer homes;</span>
