## Daniel Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the <strong>third year of Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah</strong>, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, laid siege to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The LORD delivered Jehoiakim to him, along with articles from God’s Temple. He took them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar/<em>Babylonia</em> and put them in the treasury. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the Israelites, including members of the royal family and the nobles, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>young men with no defects, good looking, intelligent, educated men that could serve in the king’s court. He had <em>him</em> teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and allotted them a daily ration of the royal food and the wine he drank. He assigned them three years of education; then they were to enter his personal service. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the tribe of Judah. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The chief eunuch renamed them: Daniel <em>was</em> Belteshazzar, Hananiah <em>was</em> Shadrach, Mishael <em>was</em> Meshach, and Azariah <em>was</em> Abed<em>-</em>nego.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But Daniel made up his mind not to defile himself with the king’s wine and royal food, and asked the chief eunuch to let him not defile himself. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>God had given the chief eunuch respect and affection for Daniel, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>but he told him, <em>“</em><em>T</em><em>he king </em><em>specifi</em><em>ed what you should eat and d</em><em>rink. I’m afraid my lord would see that you weren’</em><em>t as </em><em>healthy</em><em> as the </em>other<em> </em><em>youths your age.</em><em> </em><em>You’d put my life in danger </em><em>from</em><em> </em><em>him</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Daniel told the steward that the chief eunuch had appointed to oversee them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“Test</em><em> </em><em>us</em><em> for ten days.</em><em> </em><em>Let us have vegetables and water.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> look at us and the</em><em> youths that eat the king’s </em><em>food, and deal with us by what you see.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He agreed and tested them for ten days. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>After ten days he could see that they looked better and were healthier than the ones who ate the king’s food. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So the steward took away their wine and royal food and fed them vegetables.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> God gave these four youths an aptitude for learning and skill in every branch of literature and wisdom. Daniel understood visions and dreams. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>At the end of the time the king had specified, the chief eunuch brought them in. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The king talked to them, and none of them impressed him like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In every matter of wisdom and understanding he asked them about, he found them ten times more capable than the magicians and enchanters in his whole empire. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Daniel continued till <strong>the first year of King Cyrus</strong>.</span>
