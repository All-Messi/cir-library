## Daniel Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> King Nebuchadnezzar to the peoples, nations, and language groups that live all over the empire:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It has seemed good to me to tell about the signs and wonders the Most High God has done for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> How great his signs,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> A dream terrified me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So I ordered the wise men in Babylon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The magicians, conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers came.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But finally Daniel (named Belteshazzar after my god),</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I was in bed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> It had grown tall and strong,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Its leaves were beautiful,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> As I kept watching, an angel watcher, a holy one,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But leave the stump with its roots in the ground,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Let his mind change from a man's to an animal's mind</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> This sentence is by the angel watchers' decree</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> That's the dream I had. Tell me what it means, Belteshazzar. None of the wise men in my kingdom can do it. You can; you have the spirit of the holy gods in you.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Daniel was distressed for a while as his thoughts about the meaning of the dream alarmed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The tree you saw that grew tall and strong,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The angel watcher you saw,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> That means it's a decree by the Most High</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The stump with its roots means</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So, O King, may my advice please you: 28"That all happened to Nebuchadnezzar. 29A year later, he was walking on his palace roof in Babylon 30an saying, 'Isn't this Babylon the Great that I've built as a royal residence by my power and splendor?' 31While he was still saying it, a voice from heaven said, 'King Nebuchadnezzar, you've lost your sovereignty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> You'll be driven from society</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> At once it happened. 34"But when that was past, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to the sky, my sanity came back, and I praised and honored the Most High who lives forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> All people on earth amount to nothing,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Now I, Nebuchadnezzar,</span>
