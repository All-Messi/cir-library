## Daniel Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>Previously</em>, in the <strong>first year of Belshazzar</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> king of Babylon</strong>, Daniel had a dream while he was in bed. He wrote down this summary of it: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>During</em><em> the night </em><em>I </em><em>had a</em><em> vision</em><em>. F</em><em>our winds</em><em> were churning up the Mediterranean Sea, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> f</em><em>our </em><em>different </em><em>beasts </em><em>emerged from</em><em> </em><em>it</em><em>.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> first was like a </em><em><u>lion</u></em><em> </em><em>with wings like</em><em> an eagle.</em><em> As I watched, its wings were pulled off</em><em>, and it was made </em><em>to stand on its two hind legs like a human being and receive a</em><em> human mind.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> second beast resembling a </em><em><u>bear</u></em><em> came up.</em><em> It was rearing up on one side</em><em> and </em><em>had three ribs</em><em> in its mouth between its teeth.</em><em> </em><em>They </em><em>told it, ‘Go ahead and gorge on many people</em><em>!’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> I continued to</em><em> </em><em>watch,</em><em> another </em><em>beast</em><em> </em>came up, <em>like a </em><em><u>leopard</u></em><em> </em><em>with four heads and with four wings on its back; it</em><em> </em><em>received authority</em><em>.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> </em><em>a </em><em><u>fourth beast</u></em><em> came up, dreadful, terrifying, very strong with</em><em> </em><em>big</em><em> iron teeth.</em><em> </em><em>It </em><em>devoured, </em><em>crushed</em><em>, and tramped down </em>its victims’ <em>remains</em><em>.</em><em> It wasn’t like </em><em>the </em><em>other beasts</em><em> </em><em>and </em><em>had ten horns.</em><strong> </strong><strong>  </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 7:1-7</p>

### The Ancient of Days Reigns 8“While I was thinking about its horns, a little horn grew up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots in its presence. This horn had eyes like a human and a mouth that bragged.


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> kept watch</em><em>ing </em><em>and</em><em> throne</em><em>s</em><em> were </em><em>set</em><em>,</em> <strong><em><sup>	</sup></em></strong><em>a</em><em>nd the Ancient of Days took his seat.</em> <em>His clothes were </em><em>white </em><em>like </em><em>snow</em><em>;</em><em> </em> <em>	his hair was like </em><em>clean</em><em> wool.</em><em> </em> <em>He sat on a fiery throne</em> <em>	</em><em>with</em><em> wheels </em><em>of</em><em> </em><em>blaz</em><em>ing fire.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup><em>A</em><em> molten river </em><em>was flowing out from him.</em><em> </em> <em>	Thousands </em><em>upon thousands attended </em><em>him;</em> <em>	millions upon million</em><em>s </em><em>stood</em><em> </em><em>in front of</em><em> him.</em> <em>Court</em><em> began to hold session,</em> <em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd the books were opened.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	        </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 7:8-10</p>

### The Son of Man Receives Dominion 11“I kept watching because the horn kept bragging. The beast was killed, and its body thrown into the blazing fire and destroyed. 12The other beasts had their authority revoked, but they were allowed to live for a season and a time longer. 	13“I kept watching the vision. 		One like a son of man was coming	 			with the clouds in the sky. 		He approached the Ancient of Days, 			led into his presence.


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> received d</em><em>ominion, </em><em>honor</em><em>, and a kingdom</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>so</em><em> all </em><em>peoples</em><em>, nations, and language groups</em><em> </em><em>would serve him.</em> <em>	</em><em>	His dominion was </em><em>eternal;</em> <em>	</em><em>	     h</em><em>is kingdom wo</em><em>uld never</em><em> be destroyed.</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 7:11-14</p>

### The Vision Interpreted 15“The vision troubled me. 16I went to one of those standing nearby and asked what it meant. He told me, 17‘Those four huge beasts are kings that will arise in the world. 18But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and have it for all ages to come.’ 19I wanted to know what the fourth beast meant. It was different from the others and very dreadful with its iron teeth and bronze talons; it ate up, crushed, and tramped the others down. 20I wanted to know what the ten horns meant and the other horn that grew up, that the three horns fell in front of—the horn that had eyes, a bragging mouth, and bigger size than the others. 21As I watched, that horn fought the holy people and overpowered them. 22Then the Ancient of Days came and rendered judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came for them to take over the kingdom.	 Dan 7:15-22 23“He said, ‘The fourth beast will be a kingdom that’s different from the others. It will devastate the whole world, tramp it down, and crush it. 24The ten horns in that kingdom are ten kings. Another, different kind of king will rise up after them and overthrow them. 25He’ll defy the Most High and oppress his holy people. He’ll try to change their festival cycle and their laws, and they’ll be delivered to him for a time, times, and half a time. 26But the court will sit in judgment and take away, annihilate, and destroy his power permanently. 27Then the holy people of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve him.’ 28“The revelation ended. My thoughts scared me, and my face grew pale. I kept the matter to myself.”	 Dan 7:23-28 Daniel’s Vision of the Ram and the Goat
