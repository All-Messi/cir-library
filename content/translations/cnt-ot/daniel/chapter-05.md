## Daniel Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> King Belshazzar held a huge feast for 1,000 of his nobles and drank wine with them. 2While he was tasting the wine, he sent for the gold and silver items his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Temple in Jerusalem. 3The king, his nobles, wives, and concubines drank out of them, 4and praised their idols made out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> All of a sudden, the fingers of a man's hand appeared and started writing on the plaster wall across from the lampstand. The king could see the back of the hand as it wrote. 6His face grew pale with terror, his hip joints went slack, his knees knocked. 7He shouted for his conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers. He told the wise men in Babylon, "Anybody that can read this inscription and tell me what it means will dress in purple, wear a gold chain around his neck, and be third in the empire." 8His wise men came in, but they couldn't read it or explain what it meant. 9He was scared, his face grew more pale, and his nobles were baffled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When the queen heard about what the king and his nobles said, she came in the banquet hall, "Long live the King! Don't let your imagination run away with you or your face go pale. 11There's a man in your kingdom that has the spirit of the holy gods. In your predecessor's time, he showed enlightenment, insight, and wisdom like the gods have. King Nebuchadnezzar appointed him chief of magicians, conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers. 12That was because this Daniel—that the king named Belteshazzar—had a special spirit, knowledge, insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas, and solving of difficult problems. Call him; he'll tell you what the inscription means."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They brought Daniel in, and he asked him, "Are you the Daniel that's among the exiles from Judah my predecessor brought back? 14I've heard you have the spirit of the gods in you and you have insight, understanding, and extraordinary wisdom. 15I've just now brought in the wise men and conjurers to read this inscription and interpret it, but they can't do it. 16I've heard that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read the inscription and tell me what it means, you'll dress in purple, wear a gold chain around your neck, and be third in the empire."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Daniel said, "Keep your gifts or give your rewards to someone else, but I'll read the inscription and tell you what it means. 18O King, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, honor, and majesty to your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar. 19Because of his grandeur, the peoples, nations, and language groups trembled in front of him. He executed or spared, elevated or demoted anybody he wanted to. 20But his heart and spirit became so proud that he acted out his arrogance. He was deposed, and his honor was taken away. 21He was driven away from society, and his mind became like an animal's mind. He lived with wild donkeys and ate grass like a cow. His body was wet from dew till he recognized that it's the Most High that rules the human realm and appoints over it whoever he chooses. 22Yet you, a successor of his, Belshazzar, haven't humbled yourself, even though you knew that. 23You've raised yourself against the Lord of heaven by bringing in the vessels from his Temple. You, your nobles, wives, and concubines have been drinking wine out of them and praising gods made out of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone that can't see, hear, or understand. But you haven't honored the God that holds your life-breath and destiny in his hand. 24-25He has sent the hand that wrote this inscription: 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> It means:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Belshazzar gave orders to dress Daniel in a purple robe, put a gold chain around his neck, and proclaim him third in the empire. 30That night Belshazzar the Babylonian king was killed, 31and Darius the Mede took over the empire at about age 62.</span>
