## Daniel Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> King Darius thought it good to appoint 120 satraps to oversee the empire. 2He put three commissioners over them. (Daniel was one of them.) The satraps would report to them, and they would protect the king's interests. 3Daniel soon distinguished himself among the satraps and other commissioners because he had exceptional ability. The king planned to appoint him over the whole empire. 4Then the commissioners and satraps tried to find some grounds for accusing him of mismanaging government affairs, but they couldn't find any evidence of corruption. He was dependable, and they couldn't find him negligent. 5They said, "We won't find any grounds for accusing him unless it's in connection with the Law of his god."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They went to the king together and said, "Long live King Darius! 7The commissioners, prefects and satraps, high officials and governors have agreed that you should enforce a statute that anybody who asks for anything from any mortal or god but you for 30 days will be thrown in the lions' den. 8Now, establish the injunction and sign the document so it can't be revoked—like the law of the Medes and Persians."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So Darius signed the injunction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When Daniel found out he'd signed it, he went home. In his roof room with windows open toward Jerusalem, he continued to kneel three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God. 11Those men came to his house together and found him making petition to his God; 12so they went to the king, "Didn't you sign an injunction that anybody who asks anything from any mortal or god besides you for 30 days would be thrown into the lions' den?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They answered, "Daniel, an exile from Judah, is not honoring your injunction. He keeps praying to his God three times a day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When the king heard it, he was deeply distressed and tried all day to figure out some way to rescue Daniel. 15Then those men came back and said, "You know, O King, it's the law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute the king makes can be revoked."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So he gave the order, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions' den. He told Daniel, "The God you constantly serve will deliver you himself." 17They brought a stone and laid it over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his signet ring and his nobles' signet rings so nothing could be changed. 18He spent the night in his palace fasting. No entertainment was brought to him, and he couldn't sleep.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He got up at dawn and hurried to the lions' den. 20Worried, he called out, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has the God you constantly serve, delivered you from the lions?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Daniel said, "Long live the King! 22My God sent his angel and shut their mouths. They haven't hurt me because he considered me innocent. I haven't committed any crime against you either."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The king was really relieved and had him brought up out of the den. They didn't find any injury on him because he'd trusted in his God. 24The king ordered the men to be brought who had maliciously accused Daniel, and threw them, their children, and wives into the den. They hadn't hit the den floor before the lions pounced on them and crushed their bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then Darius wrote to the peoples, nations, and language groups in the empire:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I decree that in all my kingdom, people tremble in fear before Daniel's God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He delivers and rescues, and performs signs and wonders</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> So Daniel enjoyed success during the regency of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span>
