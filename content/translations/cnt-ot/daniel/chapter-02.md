## Daniel Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the <strong>second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign</strong>, haunting dreams kept him awake. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He gave orders to call in the magicians, conjurers, sorcerers, and astrologers to tell him what he’d dreamed. When they came in, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>he told them, <em>“I had a dream, and </em><em>I’m</em><em> </em><em>disturbed</em><em> </em><em>about</em><em> what it means.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The astrologers said in Aramaic, <em>“</em><em>Long live the </em><em>King!</em><em> </em><em>Tell </em><em>us </em><em>the dream, and we’ll tell you what it means.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>I’m</em><em> giving an unalterable command</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>If you don’t tell me what </em><em>I dreamed</em><em> and </em><em>its</em><em> mean</em><em>ing</em><em>, </em><em>I’ll have you</em><em> torn limb from </em><em>limb</em><em>,</em><em> and</em><em> </em><em>make </em><em>your houses </em><em>trash</em><em> piles.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> if you tell me</em><em>, I’ll reward you with gif</em><em>ts and </em><em>high</em><em> honor.</em><em> </em><em>So</em><em> tell me the dream and its interpretation.”</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“T</em><em>ell</em><em> us the dream</em><em>, and </em><em>we’ll tell you </em><em>what it </em><em>means</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“You’re</em><em> </em><em>stalling</em><em> because</em><em> you can see I’ve given an unalterable command.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f</em><em> you don’t tell me the </em><em>dream,</em><em> there’s only one decree for you.</em><em> </em><em>You’ve </em><em>conspired</em><em> to lie and say </em><em>bogus</em><em> things till </em><em>I</em><em> change</em><em> my mind</em><em>.</em><em> Tell me what I dreamed </em><em>so I know you can tell me what it means.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Nobody</em><em> </em><em>can do</em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>that. N</em><em>o great king or ruler has ever a</em><em>sked such a thing </em><em>from any magician, conjurer, or </em><em>astrologer</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> you’re demanding is not possible.</em><em> </em><em>Nobody but the gods can</em><em> tell </em><em>you that</em><em>, </em><em>and they</em><em> don’t live </em><em>in mortal flesh</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>At this, the king was furious and gave orders to destroy the wise men in Babylon. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The decree went out to execute them, and they started looking for Daniel and his friends to kill them.<strong> </strong><strong>      </strong> <strong>     </strong><strong>   </strong></span>

### God Gives Daniel the Dream’s Interpretation


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>With prudence and discretion Daniel answered Arioch, captain of the king’s bodyguard, who’d gone out to execute the wise men, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Why</em><em> is the </em><em>king’s decree</em><em> so urgent?”</em><em> </em>Arioch told him what had happened. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So Daniel went in and asked the king for some time so he could tell him the interpretation. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He went home and informed his three friends about the matter <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>so they could ask for mercy from the God of heaven about that mystery, so Daniel and his friends wouldn’t die with the rest of the wise men in Babylon. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The mystery came to Daniel in a vision during the night, and he blessed the God of heaven: <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“God</em><em> be blessed forever  </em> <em>	</em><em>because </em><em>of his </em><em>wisdom and power.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>He’s</em><em> the O</em><em>ne that changes times and season</em><em>s,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>removes kings and </em><em>appoints</em><em> </em>them<em>.</em> <em>	He gives the wise</em><em> their wisdom</em> <em>	</em><em>	and the knowledgeable their</em><em> </em><em>insight</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> reveals profound,</em><em> hidden </em><em>things;</em> <em>	</em><em>	he knows w</em><em>hat’s in the dark,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and light lives in him.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> thank</em><em> and praise</em><em> you, my ancestors’ God,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>b</em><em>ecause y</em><em>ou’ve given me wisdom and authority.</em> <em>	</em><em>Just</em><em> now you’ve told me what we’ve asked for,</em> <em>	</em><em>	the </em>answer to the <em>king’s </em><em>demand</em><em>.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 2:14-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>So Daniel went in to Arioch and said, <em>“Don’t </em><em>execute</em><em> the </em><em>wise men! Take me to the king. </em><em>I’ll </em><em>give</em><em> </em><em>him</em><em> the interpretation.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Arioch hurried him to the king, <em>“I’ve found a man among the Jewis</em><em>h exiles from Judah that can tell you</em><em> </em><em>the interpretation</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>The king answered Daniel (Belteshazzar), <em>“Can you tell me </em><em>what I dreamed</em><em> and what it means?”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 2:24-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Daniel said, <em>	</em><em>“Wi</em><em>se men, conjurers, magicians, and</em><em> </em><em>fortunetellers can’t tell you that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> there’s a God in heave</em><em>n that reveals secret things, and he’</em><em>s revealed to </em><em>you </em><em>what</em><em>’s going to</em><em> happen.</em><em> </em><em>That’s what you </em><em>dreamed</em><em> </em><em>in </em><em>your </em><em>bed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> were thinking about </em><em>what will </em><em>happen</em><em> </em><em>in the future, and h</em><em>e that reveals </em><em>secret things</em><em> </em><em>was showing</em><em> you </em><em>that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> mystery hasn’t </em><em>come </em><em>to me becaus</em><em>e of my wisdom any more than </em><em>anybody else</em><em>’s</em><em>, except for telling </em><em>you so you can understand what’s going through your mind</em><em>.</em><strong>	      </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 2:27-30</p>

### 31“You saw a large, frightening statue that had exceptional splendor. 32Its head was fine gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze, 33its legs were iron, and its feet were iron and clay mixed. 34As you watched, a stone was hewn out without hands and struck the statue’s iron and clay feet and crushed them. 35It crushed the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold all at one time. They became like chaff on the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away without a trace. But the stone that struck the statue became a huge mountain that covered the whole world.   	Dan 2:31-35    	36“That’s what you dreamed. Now we’ll tell you what it means. 37You’re the king of kings that God has given the kingdom, power, strength, and honor. 38Wherever people, animals, or birds live, he’s put them under your control. You’re the gold head. 39After you, a lesser kingdom will rise up. Then a third, bronze kingdom will rule the world. 40There’ll be a fourth kingdom that’s as strong as iron. As iron crushes and shatters everything, it will shatter and crush the other three. 41As the feet and toes were partly potter’s clay and partly iron, the fourth kingdom will be a divided one, some parts with the toughness of iron and other parts with the weakness of clay. 42As some toes were iron and some were clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile. 43The iron mixed with clay means they’ll be allied peoples that won’t stick to one another, like iron and clay won’t stick together.


<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup><em>During</em><em> the reigns of </em><em>those kings, the God of heaven will </em><em>be </em><em>set</em><em>ting</em><em> up a kingdom that will never be destroyed</em><em> or</em><em> left for another people.</em><em> </em><em>It</em><em>’ll crush those other kingdoms and put an end to them</em><em>, but </em><em><u>it</u></em><em> will last forever.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> saw a stone hewn</em><em> out of the mountain without hands that crushed the iron,</em><em> bronze, clay, silver, and gold. T</em><em>he great God has shown</em><em> you</em><em> what will happen in the future.</em><em> </em><em>The dream is true and its interpretation </em><em>sure</em><em>.”</em><strong>    </strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### Daniel Rewarded


<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face in homage to Daniel and gave orders to present him with an offering and fragrant incense. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Truly your God is the </em><em>greatest </em><em>of gods and </em><em>the </em><em>Lord o</em><em>ver</em><em> kings</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>who reveals</em><em> </em><em>secrets! You’ve explained that mystery!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong>He promoted Daniel, gave him many high honors, and made him ruler over the province of Babylon and chief prefect over the wise men in Babylon. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>Daniel asked the king to appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to administer the province while Daniel was at the king’s court.<strong> </strong><strong>	                           </strong><strong>Dan</strong><strong> </strong><strong>2:46-49</strong> <strong>Nebuchadnezzar’s Golden Statue</strong><strong>	                  </strong></span>
