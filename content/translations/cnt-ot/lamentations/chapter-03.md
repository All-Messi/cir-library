## Lamentations Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I have seen suffering</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He has driven me out and made me walk in the dark;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He made my skin and body waste away,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He besieged me with bitterness and hardship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He made me live in dark places</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He walled me in so I couldn't escape</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Even when I call for help,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He has blocked my road with hewn stones</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He's like a bear lying in wait for me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He dragged me off the road, tore me to pieces;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He bent his bow and made me a target for his arrow;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'm a laughingstock to my people,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He filled me with bitterness</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He cracked my teeth with gravel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I've been set apart from peace</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So I say, "My strength is gone,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Remember my suffering and homelessness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I certainly remember</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I recall this and have hope from it:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The LORD's love never stops coming;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> His faithfulness is great;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The LORD is good to those who depend on him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They do well to wait silently for his salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> It's good for people to bear the yoke when they're young,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> If he causes grief, he'll have mercy</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Who is there that speaks and it happens</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Don't both good and bad come from the Most High?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Why should we complain in light of our sins?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Let's examine our ways and return to the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Let's lift up our heart and hands toward God in heaven;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> You've covered yourself with anger and chased us;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> You've wrapped yourself in a cloud</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> You've made us residue and refuse among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Our enemies rail out against us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Panic and pitfall descend on us, devastation and destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> My eyes run with streams of tears</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> My eyes will keep pouring out 51My eyes bring pain to my soul 52For no reason my enemies hunted me down like a bird; 55I called to you, LORD, from down in the pit. 56You heard my plea 57You came and said, "Don't be afraid!" 58Lord, you pled my case and redeemed my life. 59 LORD, you've seen my oppression; judge my case. 60You've seen their revenge, their schemes against me. 61You've heard their taunts. 62My assailants' whispers aim at me all day. 63Look at their sitting and rising; 64Pay them back, LORD, according to what they've done; 66Chase them in anger and destroy them from under the sky!</span>
