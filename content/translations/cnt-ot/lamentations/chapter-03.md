## Lamentations Chapter 3

### Hope in Yahveh’s Faithfulness

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I have seen suffering under the rod <em>God</em> used in his anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He has driven me out and made me walk in the dark;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> he has turned his hand against me repeatedly all day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He made my skin and body waste away, and broke my bones.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He besieged me with bitterness and hardship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He made me live in dark places like the dead from long ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He walled me in so I couldn’t escape and put heavy chains on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Even when I call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:5-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He has blocked my road with hewn stones and made my paths crooked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He’s like a bear lying in wait for me, like a lion in unexpected places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He dragged me off the road, tore me to pieces; and made me desolate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He bent his bow and made me a target for his arrow;</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:9-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> he shot deep into me the arrows from his quiver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I’m a laughingstock to my people, mocked in musical ditties all day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He filled me with bitterness and made me drink wormwood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He cracked my teeth with gravel and made me grovel in the dust.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I’ve been set apart from peace and forget what happiness is like.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So I say, <em>“My strength is gone, </em> <em>	</em><em>	and so is my hope in Yahveh.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Remember my suffering and homelessness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <u>I</u> certainly remember and am humbled within.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:17-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I recall this and have hope <em>from it</em>:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh love never stops <em>coming</em>; his mercies don’t end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> His faithfulness is great; it’s renewed every morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I say to myself, <em>“Yahveh is my </em><em>portion;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>so</em><em> I have hope in him.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:21-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yahveh is good to those who depend on him, people that look for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They do well to wait silently for his salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> It’s good for people to bear the yoke when they’re young,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> to sit alone in silence, since <em>God</em> has laid it on them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> to put their mouth in the dust—maybe there’s hope,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> to turn their cheek to their abuser, to be filled with disgrace;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> because Yahveh won’t reject forever.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:25-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> If he causes grief, he’ll have mercy according to his enduring love;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> because he doesn’t willingly hurt people or grieve them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Who is there that speaks and it happens unless the Lord has commanded it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Don’t both good and bad come from the Most High?</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:32-38</p>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Why should we complain in light of our sins?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Let’s examine our ways and return to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Let’s lift up our heart and hands toward God in heaven;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> we’ve sinned and rebelled; you haven’t pardoned us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> You’ve covered yourself with anger and chased us; you’ve slain without pity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> You’ve wrapped yourself in a cloud so no prayer can get to you.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:39-44</p>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> You’ve made us residue and refuse among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Our enemies rail out against us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Panic and pitfall descend on us, devastation and destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> My eyes run with streams of tears because my people are being destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> My eyes will keep pouring out</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> till Yahveh looks down from heaven and sees.</span>
