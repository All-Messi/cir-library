<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Judah has gone into exile in suffering and hard servitude;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The roads to Zion are in mourning</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Her adversaries have become her masters; her enemies prosper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The majesty is gone from Zion;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In her time of suffering and homelessness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she's become filthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Her uncleanness was in her skirts;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The foe has reached out for her treasured things;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The people are groaning as they look for bread;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Is it nothing to you that go by?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He has tied my sins together into a yoke around my neck;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Lord has rejected the strong men that are with me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I called to my lovers, but they deceived me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Look, LORD, because I'm in distress; my soul is in turmoil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They've heard that I'm groaning with nobody to comfort me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Pay attention to their sinfulness,,</span>
