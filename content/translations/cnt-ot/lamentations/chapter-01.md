## Lamentations Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> How lonely the city sits that used to bustle with people! She’s like a widow that was once great among the nations! The princess among the provinces has become a slave!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She cries bitterly at night; tears are on her cheeks. Nobody among her lovers is there to comfort her. Her friends have betrayed her and become her enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Judah has gone into exile in affliction and hard servitude; she’s spread out among the nations now with no resting place. Her pursuers have caught up with her in the middle of her distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The roads to Zion are in mourning, because nobody attends the appointed festivals. Her gates are desolate, her priests groan, her virgins suffer, and she suffers bitterly herself.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 1:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Her adversaries have become her masters; her enemies prosper. Yahveh has made her suffer for her many sins. Her children have gone away captive to the foe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The majesty is gone from Zion; her officials are like bucks that can’t find pasture; they’ve fled away weak before their pursuers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>In her time of suffering and homelessness, Jerusalem remembers her treasured things from before; when her people fell to her adversaries and nobody helped her, the enemies gloated over her and mocked her downfall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she’s become filthy. Everybody that honored her before despises her now, because they’ve seen her nakedness. She groans and turns away.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 1:5-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she didn’t give any thought for her doom; so she’s fallen terribly with no comforter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The foe has reached out for her treasured things; she has watched the nations invade her sanctuary, people you commanded not to enter your community.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The people are groaning as they look for bread; they’ve given their treasured things for food to stay alive; <em>“Look, Yahveh, I’m despised.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Is</em><em> it nothing to you that go by?</em> <em>	</em><em>	Look and see if there’s any pain like my pain</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	that was severely dealt out to me,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	that Yahveh inflicted in his fierce anger.</em><em>	</em><strong>Lam 1:9-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> sent fire from on high into my bones, and it descended on them.</em> <em>	</em><em>	He spread a net for my feet and turned me </em><em>back;</em> <em>	</em><em>	he left me desolate and faint all day long.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> has tied my sins together into a yoke around my </em><em>neck;</em> <em>	</em><em>	he has made my strength fail,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and turned me over to those I can’t withstand.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Lord has rejected the strong men that are with </em><em>me;</em> <em>	</em><em>	he has called an appointed time against me to crush my young </em><em>men;</em> <em>	</em><em>	like a winepress he has trodden down the young virgin Judah.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> weep for those things; my eyes run down with tears,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because there’s no comforter near to restore my soul.</em> <em>	</em><em>	My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.”</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 1:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Zion holds out her hands, but there’s no one to comfort her; Yahveh has commanded against Jacob that his neighbors would be his enemies; Jerusalem has become something filthy in their minds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> called to my lovers, but they deceived </em><em>me;</em> <em>	</em><em>	my priests and elders perished in the city</em> <em>	</em><em>	as they looked for food to stay alive.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>Look</em><em>, Yahveh, because I’m in distress; my soul is in turmoil.</em> <em>	</em><em>	My heart’s upset because I’ve been rebellious.</em> <em>	</em><em>	The sword bereaves in the street; it’s like death</em><em> </em><em>in the house.</em><em>	</em><strong>Lam 1:17-20</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>They’ve</em><em> heard that I’m groaning with nobody to comfort me.</em> <em>	</em><em>	My enemies have heard about my </em><em>trouble;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	 they’re glad you’ve done it.</em> <em>	</em><em>	Bring the time you’ve promised </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and let them be like me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Pay</em><em> attention to their sinfulness, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and deal with them like you’ve dealt with me for my sins.</em> <em>	</em><em>	I groan a lot, and my heart is faint.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>Lam 1:21-22</strong> <strong>Destruction for Sin</strong></span>
