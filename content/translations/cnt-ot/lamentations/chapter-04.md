## Lamentations Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> How the gold has tarnished; how pure gold has changed!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in gold,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Even jackals nurse their young,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> People that used to eat delicacies sit desolate in the streets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The iniquity of my people is worse than the sin of Sodom,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Zion's Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Now they're darker than soot, not recognizable in the streets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Those killed with the sword are happier than those slain by hunger;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Merciful women boiled their own children;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD has accomplished his wrath,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The kings and inhabitants of the region</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Because of its prophets' sins and its priests' iniquities—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They shouted at them, "Get away! Unclean! Don't touch!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The LORD has scattered them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Our eyes failed us; looking for help was useless;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> People dogged our steps so we couldn't walk in the streets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Our pursuers were faster than eagles in the sky;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Our very breath, the LORD's anointed, was captured in their pits;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Celebrate and be happy, Edom that lives in Uz;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The punishment for your sinfulness is finished, Zion;</span>
