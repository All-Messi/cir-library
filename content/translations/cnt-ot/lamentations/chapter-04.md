## Lamentations Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>How the gold has tarnished; how pure gold has changed! The holy stones lie scattered at the beginning of every street.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in gold, are treated like clay pots that potters make!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Even jackals nurse their young, but my people have become cruel like wild ostriches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; little ones beg for bread, but nobody gives them any.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>People that used to eat delicacies sit desolate in the streets; the ones brought up in purple lie on ash heaps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The iniquity of my people is worse than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown without hands in one moment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Zion’s</em> Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk, healthier looking than corals, like polished lapis lazuli.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 4:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Now they’re darker than soot, not recognizable in the streets; their skin is shriveled on their bones, withered like wood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Those killed with the sword are happier than those slain by hunger; they pine away, stricken for lack of crops in the field.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Merciful women boiled their own children; they became their food because my people were being destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Yahveh has accomplished his wrath, poured out his hot anger and sparked a fire in Zion that has consumed its foundations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The kings of the earth and inhabitants of the region didn’t believe enemies could get in the gates of Jerusalem.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 4:8-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Because of its prophets’ sins and its priests’ iniquities— who shed the blood of good people in it—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>they wandered in the streets, blind and defiled with blood so nobody would <em>even</em> touch their clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They shouted at them, <em>“Get away! Unclean! Don’t touch!”</em> So they fled and wandered. People in the nations said, <em>“They can’t stay here anymore.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Yahveh has scattered them; he won’t continue to care <em>especially</em> about them; they didn’t honor the priests or bless the elders.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 4:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Our eyes failed <em>us</em>; looking for help was useless; we certainly watched for a nation that couldn’t save.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>People dogged our steps so we couldn’t walk in the streets; our end came near, our days failed, we were through.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 4:17-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Our pursuers were faster than eagles in the sky; they chased us on the mountains and ambushed us in the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Our very breath, Yahveh’s anointed, was captured in their pits; we’d said about <em>him</em>, <em>“In his shadow we’ll live among the nations.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Celebrate and be happy, Edom that lives in Uz; the cup will come around to you as well; you’ll be drunk and naked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> punishment for</em> your sinfulness is finished, Zion; he won’t exile you any longer. But he’ll punish your iniquity, Edom; he’ll expose your sins!</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 4:19-22</p>
