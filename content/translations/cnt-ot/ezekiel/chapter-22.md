## Ezekiel Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 2"Son of man, are you willing to judge the bloody city? Then tell it about its abominations. 3Say, 'The Lord GOD says, 6"Every ruler in Israel is intent on shedding blood, each according to his power. 7They treat parents with contempt, oppress foreigners, wrong the fatherless and widows. 8They despise my holy things and profane my Sabbaths. 9Slanderous men accuse falsely to get the death penalty, eat at the mountain shrine, commit lewd acts. 10They uncover their father's nakedness and rape women that are in their period. 11One commit detestable acts with his neighbor's wife, another defiles his daughter-in-law, another rapes his sister. 12You do murder for hire, charge interest, oppress other people for gain, and forget me." 13"I slap my hand at your bloodshed and crooked gain. 14Will you have the courage and strength to deal with me when I do what I've said? 15I'll scatter you across the nations and burn off your uncleanness. 16You'll profane yourself in the sight of the nations. You'll know I'm the LORD."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 18"Son of man, Israel is slag to me. Its people are bronze and tin, iron, lead, and silver from a furnace. 19So the Lord GOD says, 'Because you're slag, I'm going to gather you to Jerusalem. 20Like they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin and melt it down in a furnace, I'll melt you down there 21with fire from my anger. [22]'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 24"Son of man, say, 'You're a polluted land that won't get any rain to wash it off all during the time of my indignation.' 25There's a conspiracy among your prophets. Like a roaring lion mauling its prey, you devour lives. You steal treasure and precious things and make many widows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Israel's priests violate my Law and profane my holy things. They don't distinguish holy from profane or teach the difference between clean and unclean. They don't observe my Sabbaths, and they dishonor me among themselves. 27Israel's leaders are like wolves tearing apart prey. They shed blood and destroy lives to get gain. 28Its prophets smear whitewash for them, see false visions, tell lying fortunes for them, and say, 'The Lord GOD says,' when I haven't said. 29They oppress and rob the people, wrong the poor and needy, and mistreat temporary residents with injustice. 30"I looked for someone to build the wall around it and stand in the gap for Israel so I wouldn't destroy it, but I didn't find anybody.  31So I've poured out my indignation on them. I've burned them up with the fire from my anger and brought the consequences of their ways on their heads."</span>
