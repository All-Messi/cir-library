## Ezekiel Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>A message from the LORD came to me: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man,</em> <em>are</em><em> you </em><em>willing to </em><em>judge the bloody city?</em><em> </em><em>Then </em><em>tell it about its abominations. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Say</em><em>, ‘The Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says, </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>“A city that sheds blood in it, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em>a city <em>whose time will come, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em>a city<em> that makes idols </em><em>to defile</em><em> itself! </em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>4-</sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> become guilty by shedding blood </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>and defiled by making idols. </em> <em>	You’ve brought your appointed time near, </em> <em>	</em><em>	you infamous one full of </em><em>turmoil;</em><em> </em> <em>	I’ve made you a disgrace to nations near and far, </em> <em>	</em><em>	something to ridicule. </em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	        </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 22:1-5</p>

### 6“Every ruler in Israel is intent on shedding blood, each according to his power. 7They treat parents with contempt, oppress foreigners, wrong the fatherless and widows. 8They despise my holy things and profane my Sabbaths. 9Slanderous men accuse falsely to get the death penalty, eat at the mountain shrine, commit lewd acts. 10They uncover their father’s nakedness and rape women that are in their period. 11One commit detestable acts with his neighbor’s wife, another defiles his daughter-in-law, another rapes his sister. 12You do murder for hire, charge interest, oppress other people for gain, and forget me.”  13“I slap my hand at your bloodshed and crooked gain. 14Will you have the courage and strength to deal with me when I do what I’ve said? 15I’ll scatter you across the nations and burn off your uncleanness. 16You’ll profane yourself in the sight of the nations. You’ll know I’m the LORD.”’”  	  Ezek 22:6-16


<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A message from the LORD came to me: <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, Israel is slag to me. Its people are bronze and tin, iron, lead, and silver from a furnace. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> the Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says, ‘Because </em><em>you’re</em><em> </em>slag<em>, I’m going to gather you to Jerusalem. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Like</em><em> they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin and melt it down in a furnace, I’ll melt you down there </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>with</em><em> fire from my anger. </em>[<strong><sup>22</sup></strong>]<em>’”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	      </strong></span>

### The Sins of Israel’s Leaders


<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>A message from the LORD came to me: <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, say</em><em>, ‘You’</em><em>re </em><em>a polluted </em><em>land tha</em><em>t won’t get any rain to wash it off all during</em><em> the </em><em>time</em><em> of </em><em>my </em><em>indignation.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>There‘</em><em>s</em><em> a conspiracy among your </em><em><u>prophets</u></em><em>. Like a roaring lion mauling its prey, you devour lives. You steal treasure and precious things and make many widows. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Israel’s<em> </em><em><u>priests</u></em><em> </em><em>violate my L</em><em>aw and profa</em><em>n</em><em>e my holy things</em><em>. They don’t distinguish holy from profane or teach the difference between clean and unclean. They don’t observe my Sabbaths, and they dishonor me among themselves. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Israel’s<em> </em><em><u>leaders</u></em><em> are like wolves tearing apart prey. They shed blood and destroy lives </em><em>to get</em><em> gain. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>Its</em><em> prophets smear whitewash for them, see false visions, tell lying fortunes for them, and say, ‘The Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says,’ when I haven’t said. </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> oppress and rob the people, wrong the poor and needy, and mistreat temporary residents with injustice. </em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> looked for someone to build the wall </em>around it<em> and stand in the gap for </em>Israel<em> so I wouldn’t destroy it, but I didn’t find anybody.  </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> I’ve poured out my </em><em>indignation on them. I’ve burned them up with the fire from my anger and brought the </em>consequences of<em> their ways on their heads.” </em><em>	  </em></span>
