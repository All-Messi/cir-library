## Ezekiel Chapter 26

### A Message for Tyre

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The <strong>first day of the month, eleventh year</strong>, a message from the LORD came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“Son</em><em> of man, Tyre has said about Jerusalem, ‘Ha! its gate’s broken; it has swung open to me. I’ll be filled now that it’s laid waste.’ </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> the Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says, ‘I’ll bring nations against you, Tyre, like waves in the sea. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> destroy your walls and tear down your towers. I’ll scrape away the rubble and make you a bare rock, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>a</em><em> place for spreading nets by the sea. I’ve </em><em>spoken:</em><em> you’ll become spoil for the nations, </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> your inhabitants on the mainland will die by the sword. </em><em><u>You’ll know I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em>.’”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 26:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>“From</em><em> the north I’ll bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and an enormous army. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> slay your inhabitants on the mainland with the sword, build siege walls, put up a mound and a roof of </em><em>shields against you. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> aim his battering rams at your walls and tear down your towers with his axes. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> huge number of his horses will cover you with dust; your walls will shake from his cavalry, wagons, and chariots when they pour through your gates like men overwhelming a breached city. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> trample your streets with his horses and slay your people with the sword. He’ll tear down your strong pillars, </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>make</em><em> spoil out of your wealth, and plunder your merchandise. He’ll tear down your walls, destroy your beautiful houses, and throw your stones, timber, and rubble into the sea. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> I’ll silence your songs and harps. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> be a bare rock, a place to spread nets. You won’t rebuild; I’ve said so.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 26:7-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>“</em><em>T</em><em>he</em><em> Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says to Tyre, </em><em>‘Won’t the whole coastland quake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan and the slaughter is taking place in you? </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> the rulers of the sea will step down from their thrones, remove their robes, strip off their embroidered clothes, and dress themselves with cringing. They’ll sit on the ground, shaking every moment, appalled at you. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> chant a dirge for you,</em> <strong><sup>	“</sup></strong><em>How you’ve </em><em>disappear</em><em>ed</em><em> from the seas, renowned city!</em> <em>	</em><em>You and your residents were powerful seafarers</em> <em>	</em><em> </em><em>	that </em><em>imposed </em><em>fear on people everywhere</em><em>!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>The</em><em> islands </em><em>tremble</em><em>d the day you fell.</em> <em>	Yes, the islands in</em><em> the sea</em> <em>	</em><em>	were distressed </em><em>at your passing.</em><em>”</em><em>’”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 26:15-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The Lord says GOD<em>, “When I make you a desolate city, like towns with no residents, when I wash the deep up over you and big rivers flood you, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>then</em><em> I’ll take you down to the Pit to the people of old and make you live in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places. </em><em>So</em><em> people won’t live in you, but I’ll set glory among the living. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> bring terror on you, and you won’t exist anymore. Though people look for you, they’ll never find you.”</em></span>
