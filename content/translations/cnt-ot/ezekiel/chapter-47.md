## Ezekiel Chapter 47

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he took me back to the Temple door. Water was running east from under the threshold of the Temple, which faced east. It was running down from under the right side of the Temple from south of the altar. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside of the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. Water was trickling from the south side.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured 1,723ft <sup>1,000 cubits </sup>and led me through the water, which was up to my ankles. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Again he measured 1,723ft <sup>1,000 cubits</sup> and led me through water up to my knees. He measured another 1,723ft <sup>1,000 cubits</sup> and led me through water up to my waist. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He measured 1,723ft <sup>1,000 cubits</sup> again, a river I couldn’t cross because it was too deep to ford; it was deep enough to swim in. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He said, <em>“</em><em>Do you see</em><em> th</em><em>at</em><em>?”</em><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Ezek</strong><strong> 47:1-</strong><strong>6a</strong><strong>	</strong> He took me back to the riverbank. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Lots of trees were growing on both sides of the river now. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He said, <em>“This water </em><em>runs</em><em> east down to the Arabah</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> the sea, and </em><em>makes it</em><em> fresh.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Wherever</em><em> the water goes, everything that forms schools will live. There’ll be lots of fish because the water will be fresh. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Fishermen</em><em> will spread their nets from En-gedi to En-eglaim. </em><em>There will be as many kinds of fish as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> its swamps and marshes will stay salty. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>On</em><em> both riverbanks, all kinds of fruit trees will grow. Their leaves won’t wither, and their fruit won’t fail. They’ll bear year around because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will provide food and their leaves provide healing.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	   </strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Ezek </strong><strong>47:6b-12</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>The Boundaries of the Land</strong><strong>    </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Lord GOD says, <em>‘</em><em>When you</em><em> </em><em>divide up </em><em>the land among the </em><em>12 tribes, give</em><em> Joseph two portions</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>d</em><em>ivide</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> </em><em>the</em><em> inheritance equal</em><em>ly like I swore</em><em> to your ancestors</em><em>. </em></span>
