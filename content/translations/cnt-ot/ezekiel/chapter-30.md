<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A sword will come at Egypt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Nubia, Put, Lud, Arabia, Libya, and the people of any land allied with them will fall by the sword with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They'll be desolate among desolate lands;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They'll know I'm the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> At that time, I'll send ambassadors in ships</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Him and his people, the most ruthless of the nations,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll dry up the Nile's canals</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll make Pathros desolate,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll pour out my anger on Sin, Egypt's fortress;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The young men of On and Pi-beseth</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> It will be a dark day in Tehaphnehes</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So I'll carry out judgments on Egypt,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The seventh day, first month, eleventh year, a message from the LORD came to me: 21"Son of man, I've broken the arm of Pharaoh, Egypt's king. It hasn't been put in a sling to mend or wrapped with a bandage to get strong enough to hold a sword.' 22So the Lord GOD says, 'I'll break both of his arms, the good arm and the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand. 23I'll scatter the Egyptians among the nations. 24I'll strengthen the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand. Pharaoh will groan from his wounds. 25I'll strengthen the king of Babylon's arms, but Pharaoh's arms will fall. When the king of Babylon holds out his sword against Egypt 26and I scatter the Egyptians among the nations, they'll know I'm the LORD."'"</span>
