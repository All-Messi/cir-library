## Ezekiel Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from the Lord came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll lay your towns waste,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> In your endless enmity, you delivered Israel to the sword at the time of its catastrophe, its final punishment. 6So as I live, I'll deliver you to bloodshed. Since you haven't despised bloodshed, it'll pursue you. 7I'll make Mount Seir a waste and slay everyone that tries to escape or return there. 8I'll fill its mountains with the dead. They'll fall in its hills, valleys, and ravines. 9I'll make it a permanent wasteland and its towns uninhabited. It will know I'm the LORD. 10"Mount Seir has said, 'I'm going to take over those two lands and make them mine'—though the LORD was there. 11So as I live," the Lord GOD says, "I'll deal with you in proportion to the anger, envy, and hate you've shown them. I'll make myself known among them when I condemn you. 12You'll know that I've heard your contempt for the mountains in Israel, 'They're desolate; they've been given to us to devour.' 13I've heard you speak arrogantly against me over and over. 14While the whole world celebrates, I'll make you desolate. 15As you celebrated Israel's desolation, you'll be desolate, Mount Seir and all Edom. You'll know I'm the LORD."</span>
