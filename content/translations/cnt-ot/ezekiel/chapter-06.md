## Ezekiel Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 2"Son of man, face Israel's mountains and prophesy, 3'Listen to the Lord GOD's message to the mountains and hills, ravines and valleys: "I'm going to bring a sword against you and destroy your high places. 4Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars smashed. You'll fall slain in front of your idols, 5and I'll scatter your bones around your altars. 6Everywhere you live, towns will be waste, high places desolate, idols broken, incense altars cut down, and the religious objects you've made, destroyed. 7You'll know I'm the LORD. 8"But I'll leave a few of you. Some will escape the sword in the nations where you scatter. 9You'll think back to me where they take you captive—how you've hurt me with your adulterous hearts and with eyes that carried on prostitution with idols. You'll abhor yourselves for those detestable deeds. 10You'll know I'm the LORD, that I meant it when I said I'd inflict you with this disaster."' 11"The Lord GOD says, 'Clap your hands, stomp your feet, say, "This has happened because of Israel's abominations. It will fall by sword, famine, and disease! 12The one that's far off will die by the disease. The one that's nearby will fall by the sword. The one that's left and besieged will starve to death." That's how I'll vent my fury on you. 13Your slain will lie among your idols, around your altars, on every tall hill and mountaintop, under every green tree and leafy terebinth tree—where you offered a soothing aroma to your idols. 14The land will be more desolate than the desert toward Diblah. That's how you'll know I'm the LORD.'"</span>
