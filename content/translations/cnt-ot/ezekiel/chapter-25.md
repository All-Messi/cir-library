## Ezekiel Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 2"Face the Ammonites and prophesy against them, 3'Because you said, "Ha!" at my sanctuary when it was profaned, and at Israel when it became a wasteland, and at Judah when they went into exile, 4I'm going to turn you over to the people from the east. They'll set up their camps among you and live there, eat your fruit and drink your milk. 5I'll turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and the Ammonites a resting place for flocks. 6Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet and celebrated with scorn at Israel, 7I'll give you to the nations for spoil, cut you off from the peoples, and make you perish from the land so you'll know I'm the LORD.' 8"The Lord GOD says, 'Because Moab and Seir consider Judah like any other nation, 9I'm going to take away Moab its frontier towns, the pride of its land: Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim. 10I'll give it and the Ammonites to the people from the east and the Ammonites will pass from memory. 11I'll carry out judgments on Moab. They'll know I'm the LORD.'" 12"The Lord GOD says, 'Edom has taken revenge on Judah and incurred grievous guilt, 13so I'll slay its people and animals and lay it waste. They'll fall by the sword from Teman to Dedan. 14I'll take revenge on Edom by my people Israel. They'll act in Edom according to my anger; so they'll know my payback.' 15"The Lord GOD says, 'The Philistines have acted in scornful revenge to destroy with everlasting enmity. 16So I'll slay the Cherethites and destroy the remnant along the coast. 17I'll carry out severe vengeance with angry rebukes. They'll know I'm the LORD.'"</span>
