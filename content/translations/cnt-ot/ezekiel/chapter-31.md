## Ezekiel Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The <strong>first day, third month, eleventh year,</strong> a message from the LORD came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Assyria</em><em> was a cedar in Lebanon</em> <em>	</em><em>	with beautiful branches and forest shade</em> <em>	</em><em>	and its top in the clouds.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> water made it grow, the underground water made it </em><em>tall;</em> <em>	</em><em>	rivers continually flowed where it was </em><em>planted;</em> <em>	</em><em>	it sent out its channels to all the trees.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> it was taller than any other tree.</em> <em>	</em><em>	It grew lots of long branches</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because it had plenty of </em><em>water;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	it spread them out.</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 31:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Birds</em><em> nested in </em><em>it;</em> <em>	</em><em>	animals from the countryside gave birth under </em><em>it;</em> <em>	</em><em>	all the nations lived in its shade.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> it was beautiful in its size and the length of its branches</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>because its roots went down to abundant water.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> cedars in God’s forest couldn’t match </em><em>it;</em> <em>	</em><em>	the cypress couldn’t compare with its </em><em>branches;</em> <em>	</em><em>	the trees in the plane couldn’t equal </em><em>its</em><em> limbs.</em> <em>	</em><em>	No tree in God’s forest could compare with its beauty.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> made it beautiful with its many big </em><em>branches;</em> <em>	</em><em>	all the trees in Eden, which were in God’s orchard,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	were jealous of it.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 31:6-9</p>

### 10‘So the Lord GOD says, “Because it was tall with its top in the clouds and was proud of its height, 11I’ll give it to a despot to deal with according to the sinfulness it deserves. 12Foreign tyrants will cut it down and leave its limbs on the mountains and in the valleys. They’ll lie piled up in the ravines. Everybody on earth will leave its shade. 13Birds will live on its remains, and animals will be on its fallen branches. 14None of the trees beside water will grow tall and set their tops in the clouds or their terebinth trees stand tall in their height. They’ll die, given over to the underworld among mortals.”	Ezek 31:10-14 15‘The Lord GOD says, “When it goes down to Sheol, I’ll chant dirges, close the deep over it, and hold back its many streams. I’ll cover Lebanon with gloom for it, and the trees will wither away because of it. 16The nations will shake from the sound of its fall when I send it down to the Pit. The well-watered trees of Eden, Lebanon’s best, will find comfort in the nether world. 17They’ll go down with it to those slain by the sword, who were its strength and lived under its shade among the nations. 18Which of Eden’s trees equals you in size and beauty? Yet you’ll go down with Eden’s trees to the underworld and lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword. That’s the way it will be with Pharaoh and his large army!”’ 	Ezek 31:15-18 A Lament for Pharaoh
