## Ezekiel Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The fifth day, sixth month, sixth year, I was sitting in my house with Judah's elders sitting in front of me, and the hand of the Lord GOD came down on me. 2I saw what looked like a man. From the waist down, he looked like fire; from the waist up, he looked like bright glowing metal. 3He reached out with a hand and took hold of my hair. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and sky, and took me in a vision to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, to the seat of the idol that provokes jealousy. 4The glory of Israel's God was there—like what I'd seen in the plain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He said, "Son of man, look north." North of the altar gate at the entrance, I saw this idol that made God jealous. 6"Do you see the detestable things Israel is doing here to keep me out of my own sanctuary? But you'll see still more detestable things."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then he took me to the entrance to the court and showed me a hole in the wall. 8"Dig through the wall." I dug through it and found an entrance. 9"Go in and see what awful, detestable things they're doing." 10I went in and saw the shape of every crawling thing, every animal and detestable thing along with Israel's idols carved all around the wall. 11Seventy elders of Israel were standing in front of them with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each one was holding a censer, and the fragrance of the incense was rising in a cloud. 12"See what Israel's elders are doing in the dark in the room of carved images? They're saying, 'The LORD's not watching us; he's abandoned the land.' 13You'll see still more detestable things they're doing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He took me to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple. Women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz. 15"See that? You'll see still more detestable things."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He took me to the inner court. At the entrance to the Temple between the porch and altar, about 25 men with their backs to the Temple were facing east, prostrating themselves toward the sun. 17"See that? Isn't it enough for Judah to do those detestable things, that they've filled the land with violence and provoked me time and again? They're putting a twig up their nose. 18I'll deal in anger. I won't pity or spare. Though they call out loudly, I'll ignore them."</span>
