## Ezekiel Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then in the expanse above the cherubs, I saw something like a sapphire stone shaped like a throne. 2He spoke to the man dressed in linen, "Go between the turning wheels under the cherubs and fill your hands with coals. Scatter them over the city." I watched him go in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The cherubs were standing on the right side of the Temple when he went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. 4The glory of the LORD rose up from the cherubs to the threshold of the Temple. The cloud filled the Temple, and the bright glory of the LORD filled the court. 5The cherubs' wings could be heard all the way to the outer court—like God Almighty when he speaks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When he told the man in linen to take fire from between the turning wheels, he went in and stood beside a wheel. 7A cherub reached out to the fire between the cherubs, took some coals, and put them in the man's hand. He took them and went out. 8The cherubs had what looked like a man's hand under their wings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then I saw four wheels beside the cherubs, one beside each one. The wheels glowed like chrysolite. 10All four looked alike as if one wheel was inside another wheel. 11When they moved they went in any of four directions without turning from the direction they faced. 12Their whole bodies were covered with eyes—backs, hands, wings, and their wheels. 13I heard the wheels called "whirling wheels." 14They had four faces each—a cherub, man, lion, and eagle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The cherubs rose up—the living beings I'd seen by the Chebar River. 16When they moved, the wheels went beside them. When they lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels stayed beside them. 17When they stood still, the wheels stood still, because the spirit of the living beings was in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The glory of the LORD went from the Temple threshold to stand above the cherubs. 19When they left, I saw them lift their wings and rise up from the ground with the wheels beside them. They stood at the entrance of the Temple's east gate, and the glory of God hovered over them. 20They were the living beings I'd seen below God by the Chebar River; so I knew they were cherubs.
