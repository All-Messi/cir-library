## Ezekiel Chapter **36**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“Son</em><em> of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, ‘Listen to </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>what</em><em> the Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says, “Y</em>our<em> enemy has ridiculed you, ‘Ha!’ and ‘The everlasting mountains are ours now!’” </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> prophesy, ‘For good reason other nations made you desolate and crushed you from every direction, took possession of you, and mocked and whispered.’” </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>So</em><em>, mountains of Israel, listen to the message from the Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> to the mountains and hills, ravines and valleys, desolate wastes and abandoned towns that have become prey and objects of derision. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> my burning jealousy, I’ve spoken against those nations, particularly Edom that took over my land with wholehearted joy and scornful attitude. </em>I’ve sworn<em> to drive it out to become prey. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> prophesy to Israel’s mountains and hills, ravines and valleys, ‘I’ve spoken in my anger because you’ve had to endure the insults from other nations. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> swear </em><em><u>they</u></em><em> will endure insults.’” </em><strong>	</strong><strong>Ezek</strong><strong> 36:1-7</strong> <em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“But</em><em> you, mountains of Israel, will grow branches and bear fruit for my people because they’ll be coming back soon. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> return to you, and you’ll be cultivated and planted. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>People</em><em> will multiply in Israel to live in the towns and rebuild the places in ruins. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>People</em><em> and animals will reproduce</em><em> </em><em>in you. I’ll make you </em><em>lived</em><em>-in like before and treat you better than at first. </em><em><u>So</u></em><em><u> you’ll know I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em>. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>My</em><em> people carry on their lives in you and own you. You’ll become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.” </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The Lord GOD says, <em>“</em>Other nations<em> tell you, ‘You’ve devoured your people and bereaved them of children,’ </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> you won’t do that anymore. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> won’t let you listen to their insults anymore. You won’t make your nation stumble anymore.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>A message from the LORD came to me: <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, when Israel was living in th</em><em>eir own land, they defiled it with</em><em> their ways and deed</em><em>s</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Their way was </em><em>unclean like</em><em> a woman in her period.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> I poured out my </em><em>anger</em><em> on them for the blood they’d shed, because they’</em><em>d defiled </em>the land<em> with their idols.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> scattered them among the nations and judged them by their ways and deeds. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> they got to those nations, they profaned my holy name, because people said, ‘These are the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> people; yet they’ve come out of his land.’ </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> was concerned about my holy name that they’d profaned among the nations.</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>“So</em><em>, tell Israel, ‘It’s not </em>so much<em> for your sake that I’m about to act; it’s </em><em>in regard to</em><em> my holy name that you’ve profaned where you’ve gone. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> vindicate the holiness of my great name. </em><em><u>Then the nations will know I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em>.”</em><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### 24“I’ll bring you back from the nations, 25sprinkle clean water on you to cleanse you from your filthiness and idols, 2and give you a new heart and spirit. I’ll take out your stone heart and give you a physical one, 27and put my spirit in you so you’ll follow my statutes and observe my ordinances. 28You’ll live in the land I gave your ancestors. You’ll be my people, and I’ll be your God. 29I’ll save you from your uncleanness, send you abundant crops of grain, and keep famine away from you. 30I’ll multiply fruit on your trees and produce in the fields. 31You’ll remember your sinful ways and deeds, and abhor yourselves. 32Understand that I’m not doing this because you deserve it. Be ashamed of yourselves, Israel!” 	Ezek 36:24-32 33“When I cleanse you from your sins, the towns will be rebuilt and lived in again. 34The land will be cultivated for everybody to see that goes by. 35They’ll say, ‘This wasteland has become like the Orchard of Eden. The desolate, ruined towns are fortified and lived in.’ 36Then the nations that are left around you will know I’ve rebuilt the ruined places and replanted what was desolate. I’ll do what I’ve said.”
