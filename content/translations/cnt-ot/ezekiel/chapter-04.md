## Ezekiel Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now, son of man, take a tablet and etch Jerusalem on it. 2Lay a siege against it with a siege wall and ramp, pitch camps, and position battering rams all around it. 3Then set up an iron plate as a wall between you and the city. Face it and press the siege against it. It's an omen for Israel. 4"Lie down on your left side, and I'll lay Israel's punishment on you. You'll bear their punishment for the number of days you lie on it. 5Lie like that one day for each of the 390 years they've sinned. 6When you've finished, lie down on your right side, and bear Judah's sin. I've assigned you 40 days, one for each year. 7Then you'll face the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it. 8I've tied you up with ropes so you can't turn from one side to the other till you've finished the days of your siege. 9"Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them in one container and bake bread. Eat it for the 390 days you're lying on your side. 10Once a day eat 8 oz 20 shekels of food 11and drink a quart ⅙ hin of water. 12Eat it like a barley cake after you've baked it in front of them over human feces. 13That's how the Israelites will eat their bread unclean among the nations where I'll banish them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But I said, "Lord GOD, since I was a kid, I've never defiled myself by eating ceremonially unclean meat, anything that died, anything an animal had torn in pieces."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He said, "I'll give you cow manure instead of human feces to bake your bread. 16I'm going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They'll ration bread by weight with fear and water by measure in alarm. 17Bread and water will be scarce; people will look at one another in dismay and waste away in their sin."</span>
