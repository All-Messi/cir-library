## Ezekiel Chapter 37

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD's hand was on me. He took me out in spirit and put me down in a valley full of dry bones, 2and had me walk around among them. 4"Prophesy over them, 'Dry bones, listen to the LORD. 5I'll put breath in you so you can come to life. 6I'll put sinews on you, make flesh grow back, and cover you with skin. You'll know I'm the LORD.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As I prophesied, there was a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8I saw sinews on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them; but they weren't breathing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told me to prophesy to their breath, "The Lord GOD says to come from the four winds and breathe on these slain so they can come to life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So I prophesied and breath came into them, they came to life, and stood up, a big army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then he said, "Son of man, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They're saying, 'Our bones are dried up. Our hope is gone. We're completely cut off.' 12So prophesy that the Lord GOD says, 'I'll open your graves and resurrect you, and take you to Israel. 13You'll know I'm the LORD when 14I've put my breath in you, you've come to life, and I've put you in your own land.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A message from the LORD came to me again: 16"Son of man, take a stick and write on it, 'For Judah and the people of Israel, his companions.' Take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and the House of Israel, his companions.' 17Then put them together in your hand to make one stick. 18When your people ask you what these sticks mean, 19say that the Lord GOD says, I'll take Joseph's stick—which is in Ephraim's hand—and the tribes of Israel, his companions. I'll put them with Judah's stick, to make one stick in my hand.' 20The sticks you write on they'll see in your hand. 21Tell them the Lord GOD will gather the people of Israel from among the nations where they've gone and bring them home. 22He'll make them one nation under one king. 23They won't defile themselves with idols, detestable things, or any of their sins. He'll deliver them from the places where they live, where they've sinned, and cleanse them. They'll be his people, and he'll be their God." 24-25"My servant David will be their king, their one shepherd forever. They'll follow my ordinances and keep my statutes. They and their descendants will live permanently on the land I gave Jacob, where your ancestors lived. 26I'll make an everlasting peace treaty with them, bless and multiply them, set my sanctuary among them, 27live with them, and be their God; and they'll be my people. 28The nations will know I'm the LORD who sanctifies Israel when my sanctuary is with them forever."'"</span>
