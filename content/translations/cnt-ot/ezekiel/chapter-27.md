<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 2"Son of man, sing a funeral song for Tyre 3that sits at the port to the sea, the nations' merchant to many ports, The Lord GOD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your borders extend into the heart of the sea;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They've made your planks out of fir trees from Seir;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They shaped your oars out of oaks from Bashan;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your sail was made out of fine embroidered linen from Egypt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The residents of Sidon and Arvad rowed for you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The elders of Gebal and its skilled men caulked your seams. 10"Persia, Lud, and Put were soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls and set forth your splendor. 11Men from Arvad and your army stood all around on your walls, and brave soldiers were in your towers. Their shields hung on your walls and completed your beauty. 12"Tarshish was your customer because you had such a store of all kinds of wealth; they bought your merchandise with silver, iron, tin, and lead. 13Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they bought your merchandise with men's lives and bronze containers. 14Beth-togarmah gave horses, war horses, and mules for your wares. 15Dedan traded with you. Distant lands served as your markets; they paid with ivory tusks and ebony. 16Syria was your customer because you had an abundance of goods; they bought your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies. 17Judah and Israel traded with you; they bought your merchandise with wheat from Minnith, cakes, honey, olive oil, and salve. 18Damascus was your customer because you had an abundance of goods, an abundance of all kinds of wealth, and because of the wine from Helbon and white wool. 19Vedan and Javan paid for your casks of wine from Izal with wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane. 20Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. 21Arabia and the princes of Kedar traded with you; 22they paid with gold, precious stones, and the finest spices. 23Haran, Canneh, Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you 24for choice garments, clothes made out of blue and embroidered work, carpets of many colors and in tightly wound cords.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The ships of Tarshish carried your wares.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Your wealth, your wares and your merchandise,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> At the outcry of your terrified captains,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The ones that row, the captains of the sea,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They wail over you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They shave their heads for you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> As they wail, they take up</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When your wares came from the sea,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Now the sea has wrecked you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The people that live along the coasts</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The merchants among the nations gasp at you;</span>
