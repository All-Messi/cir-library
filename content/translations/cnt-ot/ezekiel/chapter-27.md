## Ezekiel Chapter **27**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A message from the LORD came to me:<em> </em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, </em><em>sing a funeral song for</em><em> Tyre</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>that</em><em> sits at the port to the sea, the nations’ merchant to many ports, The Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says, </em><em> </em> <em>‘Tyre</em><em>, you’ve said </em><em>“</em><em>I’</em><em>m perfectly beautiful.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><em>Your</em><em> borders extend into the heart of the </em><em>sea;</em> <em>	your builders have perfected your beauty.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup><em>They’ve</em><em> made your planks out of fir trees from </em><em>Seir;</em> <em>	they’ve taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><em>They</em><em> shaped your oars out of oaks from </em><em>Bashan;</em> <em>	with ivory they’ve inlaid your deck with boxwood from Cyprus.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><em>Your</em><em> sail was </em><em>made out of</em><em> fine embroidered linen from </em><em>Egypt;</em> <em>	it became your identifying mark.</em> <em>Your awning was blue and purple from the </em><em>coasts</em><em> of Elishah.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> residents of Sidon and Arvad rowed for </em><em>you;</em> <em>	your wise men, Tyre, were on board as your navigators.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> elders of Gebal and its skilled men caulked your seams.</em> <em>All the ships in the sea and their sailors were with you, </em> <em>	 dealing in your merchandise.’</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Ezek</strong><strong> 27:1-9</strong> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“Persia</em><em>, Lud, and Put were soldiers in your army</em><em>.</em><em> They hung their shields and helmets on your walls and set forth your splendor. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Men</em><em> from Arvad and your army stood all around on your walls, and brave soldiers were in your towers. Their shields hung on your walls and completed your beauty.</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 27:10-11</p>

### 12“Tarshish was your customer because you had such a store of all kinds of wealth; they bought your merchandise with silver, iron, tin, and lead. 13Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they bought your merchandise with men’s lives and bronze containers. 14Beth-togarmah gave horses, war horses, and mules for your wares. 15Dedan traded with you. Distant lands served as your markets; they paid with ivory tusks and ebony. 16Syria was your customer because you had an abundance of goods; they bought your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies. 17Judah and Israel traded with you; they bought your merchandise with wheat from Minnith, cakes, honey, olive oil, and salve. 18Damascus was your customer because you had an abundance of goods, an abundance of all kinds of wealth, and because of the wine from Helbon and white wool. 19Vedan and Javan paid for your casks of wine from Izal with wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane. 20Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. 21Arabia and the princes of Kedar traded with you; 22they paid with gold, precious stones, and the finest spices. 23Haran, Canneh, Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you 24for choice garments, clothes made out of blue and embroidered work, carpets of many colors and in tightly wound cords.
