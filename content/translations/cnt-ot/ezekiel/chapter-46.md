## Ezekiel Chapter **46**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>‘The</em><em> Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says,</em><em> “The gate in the inner court that faces east will be shut the six working days, but open on Sabbaths and new moons. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince will go in through the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the gate post. The priests will provide his burnt offering and peace offerings. He’ll worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave, but the gate won’t be shut till that evening. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> people will also worship at the doorway of that gate before the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> on Sabbaths and new moons. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince’s burnt offering on the Sabbath will</span>

### lambs and 1 ram without blemish. 5The grain offering will be a 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the ram, and a grain offering with the lambs as much as he can give, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah.  6On the new moon, he’ll offer 1 young bull, 6 lambs, and 1 ram, all without blemish. 7He’ll provide a grain offering, 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the bull and the ram, and as much as he can give with the lambs, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil for each 4½ pecks 1 ephah. 8The prince will enter through the porch of the gate and leave the same way. 	Ezek 46:1-8        9“When the people present themselves to the LORD at the stated festivals, the one that goes in through the north gate to worship will leave through the south gate. The one that goes in through the south gate will leave through the north gate. Nobody will leave through the same gate they entered. 10When they go in, the prince will go in with them; when they go out, he’ll go out. 11At the feasts and stated festivals, the grain offering will be 4½ pecks bushel 1 ephah with each bull and ram, and with the lambs as much as a person can give, together with 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah. 12When the prince provides a freewill offering, burnt offering, or peace offering, the gate facing east will be opened for him. He’ll provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he’ll go out, and the gate will be shut behind him.  	 Ezek 46:9-12 13“Each morning, provide a year-old lamb without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD. 14Provide a grain offering with it, .18 bushel ⅙ ephah and ½ gallon ⅓ of a hin of olive oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually by ongoing ordinance. 15So a lamb and a grain offering with the olive oil will be provided every morning. 16‘The Lord GOD says, “If the prince gives a son a gift out of his inheritance, it will be a permanent possession. 17But if he gives a servant a gift from his inheritance, it will go back to the prince at the Year of Jubilee. His inheritance will belong only to his sons. 18The prince won’t confiscate people’s inheritance or chase them off their land. He’ll give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions so my people won’t be separated from their possessions.”’”  	Ezek 46:13-18


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Then he took me through the entrance at the side of the gate into the holy rooms for the priests, which faced north. There was a place at the far back toward the west. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He said, <em>“This is where the priests will </em><em>boil the guilt offering</em><em>s</em><em> and sin </em><em>offerin</em><em>gs</em><em>, and</em><em> </em><em>b</em><em>ake the grain offering </em><em>so</em><em> they won’t bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Then he took me to the four corners of the outer court. There was a small court in each corner, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>four enclosed corner courts, all the same size—69' x 51' 8" <sup>40 x 30 cubits</sup>. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>There was a row of masonry around them, and boiling places were made under the rows all the way around. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He told me, <em>“These places </em><em>are </em><em>where the ministers of the </em><em>Temple</em><em> will boil the </em><em>nations</em><em>’ sacrifices.”</em></span>
