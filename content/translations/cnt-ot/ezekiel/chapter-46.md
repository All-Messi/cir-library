## Ezekiel Chapter 46

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>‘The</em><em> Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em> says,</em><em> “The gate in the inner court that faces east will be shut the six working days, but open on Sabbaths and new moons. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince will go in through the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the gate post. The priests will provide his burnt offering and peace offerings. He’ll worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave, but the gate won’t be shut till that evening. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> people will also worship at the doorway of that gate before the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> on Sabbaths and new moons. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince’s burnt offering on the Sabbath will be 6 lambs and 1 ram without blemish. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> grain offering will be a 4½ pecks </em><em><sup>1</sup></em><em> </em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em> </em><em>with the ram, and a grain offering with the lambs as much as he can give, and 1½ gallons </em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em><sup>hin</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>of olive oil with each 4½ pecks </em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em>.</em><em>  </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>On</em><em> the new moon, he’ll offer 1 young bull, 6 lambs, and 1 ram, all without blemish. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> provide a grain offering, 4½ pecks </em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em> with the bull and the ram, and as much as he can give with the lambs, and 1½ gallons </em><em><sup>1</sup></em><em> </em><em><sup>hin</sup></em><em> of olive oil for each 4½ pecks </em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em>. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince will enter through the porch of the gate and leave the same way. </em><strong>	</strong><strong>Ezek 46:1-8</strong><strong>       </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then he took me through the entrance at the side of the gate into the holy rooms for the priests, which faced north. There was a place at the far back toward the west. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He said, <em>“This is where the priests will </em><em>boil the guilt offering</em><em>s</em><em> and sin </em><em>offerin</em><em>gs</em><em>, and</em><em> </em><em>b</em><em>ake the grain offering </em><em>so</em><em> they won’t bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Then he took me to the four corners of the outer court. There was a small court in each corner, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>four enclosed corner courts, all the same size—69' x 51' 8" <sup>40 x 30 cubits</sup>. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>There was a row of masonry around them, and boiling places were made under the rows all the way around. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He told me, <em>“These places </em><em>are </em><em>where the ministers of the </em><em>Temple</em><em> will boil the </em><em>nations</em><em>’ sacrifices.”</em></span>
