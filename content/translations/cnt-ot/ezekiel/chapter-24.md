## Ezekiel Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year, a message from the LORD came to me: 2"Son of man, write down the date. Today the king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem. 3Tell the rebellious people a parable, 'The Lord GOD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Take the best of the flock</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The blood she shed is in her;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> To cause anger to rise up</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Pile on the wood, kindle the fire,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then set it empty on the coals</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I've worked hard for nothing,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In your filthiness is lewdness;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I, the LORD, have said it; it's coming, I'll do it. I won't hold back. I won't pity or be sorry. I'll judge you according to your ways and deeds."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 16"Son of man, I'm about to take away the delight of your eyes in one stroke, but don't mourn or cry or shed tears. 17Groan silently; don't perform ritual mourning for the dead. Wrap your turban on, put your shoes on, don't cover your mouth in sorrow, or eat the bread of mourning."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I told the people about it in the morning; that evening my wife died. The next morning, I did what God told me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The people said, "Won't you tell us what you're doing means for us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I told them, "A message from the LORD came to me, 21'Tell Israel, "I'm about to profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes and soul. The children you've left behind will fall by the sword. 22Do what I've done. Don't cover your mouth in sorrow or eat the bread of mourning. 23Put your turbans on your heads and your shoes on your feet. Don't mourn or weep, but pine away in your sins and groan to one another. 24Follow Ezekiel's example. When it comes, you'll know I'm the Lord GOD."' 25"Son of man, won't that be when I take their fortresses away from them, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes, their heart's desire, their children—26when somebody escapes and comes to you with the news? 27Then you can speak to the one that escaped. You'll be a sign to them. They'll know I'm the LORD."</span>
