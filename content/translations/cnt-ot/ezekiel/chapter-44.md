## Ezekiel Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he brought me back through the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east; it was shut. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The LORD told me, <em>“</em><em>Keep t</em><em>his gate </em><em>shut. Nobody is to go in through it because</em><em> </em><em>I’ve</em><em> gone in through it.</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince will sit </em><em>in it to eat bread in my presence. He’ll go in by the vestibule of the gate and go out the same way.</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 44:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then he brought me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. I looked and watched the glory of the LORD fill the Temple; I fell on my face. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The LORD said, <em>“Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears everything I tell you about the stat</em><em>utes and laws of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> Temple. Mark well </em><em>the ones who can and can’t be admitted to the sanctuary. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> the rebellious people in Israel, ‘Enough of your abominations! </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Enough</em><em> bringing foreigners—uncircumcised in heart and flesh—into my sanctuary to profane my Temple, when </em><em>you offered me my food, the fat and blood. You made my covenant void—besides all your abominations. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> not taken care of my holy things yourselves; you’ve set foreigners to take care of my sanctuary.</em><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <em>Priests are not to marry a widow or divorced woman, only a virgin from Israel or a priest’s widow. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> teach my people the difference between holy and profane, clean and unclean. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> disputes, they’ll act as judges and </em><em>judge</em><em> by my ordinances. They’ll keep my laws and statutes at my stated festivals and set aside my Sabbaths. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>They’re</em><em> not to defile themselves by going near a dead person except for father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or virgin sister. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>After</em><em> he’s defiled, he’ll wait a week </em>and then be clean. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister, he’s to offer a sin offering for himself. </em><em>	</em><strong>Ezek 44:15-27</strong></span>
