## Ezekiel Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he brought me back through the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east; it was shut. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The LORD told me, <em>“</em><em>Keep t</em><em>his gate </em><em>shut. Nobody is to go in through it because</em><em> </em><em>I’ve</em><em> gone in through it.</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince will sit </em><em>in it to eat bread in my presence. He’ll go in by the vestibule of the gate and go out the same way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then he brought me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. I looked and watched the glory of the LORD fill the Temple; I fell on my face. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The LORD said, <em>“Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears everything I tell you about the stat</em><em>utes and laws of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> Temple. Mark well </em><em>the ones who can and can’t be admitted to the sanctuary. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> the rebellious people in Israel, ‘Enough of your abominations! </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Enough</em><em> bringing foreigners—uncircumcised in heart and flesh—into my sanctuary to profane my Temple, when </em><em>you offered me my food, the fat and blood. You made my covenant void—besides all your abominations. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> not taken care of my holy things yourselves; you’ve set foreigners to take care of my sanctuary.</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“No</em><em> foreigner living among the Israelites—uncircumcised in heart and flesh—can enter my sanctuary. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Levites that left me when Israel went astray after their idols will be punished. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> </em><em><u>they will minister</u></em><em> in my sanctuary and oversee the gates to the Temple: they’ll slaughter the burnt offering and sacrifice for the people, and minister to them. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Because</em><em> they ministered to them in front of their idols and Israel stumbled over them, I’ve sworn that they’ll be punished: </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em><u>they</u></em><em><u> won’t come near</u></em><em> to serve as priests to me or approach any of my things most holy; they’ll bear their disgrace and the abominations they’ve committed. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> I’ll give them responsibility for the Temple, its service, and everything done in it.</em><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>“But</em><em> the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept charge of my sanctuary when Israel left me, will come near to minister to me. They’ll serve me to offer </em><em>the fat</em><em> and blood. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> go into my sanctuary; they’ll come near to my table to minister to me and keep my charge. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> they go in at the gates of the inner court, they’ll wear linen vestments, not wool, while they’re ministering at the gates of the inner court and in the Temple. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> wear linen turbans and underclothes around their waist, nothing that will make them sweat. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> they go to the people in the outer court, they’ll take off those vestments, lay them in the holy rooms, and put on other clothes so they won’t transmit holiness to the people. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>They’re</em><em> not to shave their heads or let their hair grow long; they’ll trim it. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>They’re</em><em> are not </em><em>to drink</em><em> wine when they go into the inner court. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <em>Priests are not to marry a widow or divorced woman, only a virgin from Israel or a priest’s widow. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> teach my people the difference between holy and profane, clean and unclean. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> disputes, they’ll act as judges and </em><em>judge</em><em> by my ordinances. They’ll keep my laws and statutes at my stated festivals and set aside my Sabbaths. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>They’re</em><em> not to defile themselves by going near a dead person except for father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or virgin sister. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>After</em><em> he’s defiled, he’ll wait a week </em>and then be clean. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister, he’s to offer a sin offering for himself.</span>
