## Ezekiel Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The fifth day, fourth month, thirtieth year, I was by the Chebar River with the exiles. The sky opened up, and I saw a vision of God. (2The fifth month, fifth year of Jehoiachin's exile, 3God's message came to Ezekiel, and God's hand came on him.) 4A strong north wind was blowing, and a large cloud with a bright glow around it flashed constantly with lightning. In the cloud was something like glowing metal 5and four figures like living beings with human forms. 6Each one had four faces and four wings. 7They had straight legs, and their feet resembled calf hooves that shined like polished bronze. 8There were hands under their wings, 9and the wings of all four touched each other. Their faces didn't turn as they moved straight forward. 10Each one had the faces of a man, an eagle, a lion on the right, and a bull on the left. 11Their wings spread out above them, two wings touching the wings of the next living beings and two covering their bodies. 12They went straight forward wherever the spirit went, without turning as they went. 13Among the beings were what looked like burning coals, like torches moving back and forth. The fire burned bright, and lightning kept flashing out of it. 14The living beings darted back and forth like bolts of lightning.</span>

The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. [21]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> A bright expanse glowed like crystal above them. 23Under it their wings stretched out toward one another, and two wings covered the sides of their bodies. 24Their wings sounded like rushing water, like the Almighty, like war, like an army camp. When they stood still, they lowered their wings, 25and a voice spoke from the expanse above them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> High above the expanse was a throne the color of lapis lazuli; the One sitting on it resembled a man. 27From the waist up, he glowed like metal on fire; from the waist down, he resembled fire. The radiance around him was 28like a rainbow on a rainy day. This scene looked like the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice,</span>
