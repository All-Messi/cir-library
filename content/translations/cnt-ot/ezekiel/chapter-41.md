## Ezekiel Chapter 41

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he took me to the nave and measured the side pillars. Each pillar was 10' 4" 6 cubits square. 2The entrance was 17' 3" 10 cubits wide; the sides of the entrance were 8' 7" 3 cubits on each side. He measured the length and width of the nave at 69' x 34' 6" 40 x 20 cubits. 3He went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway at 3' 5" 2 cubits, and the doorway at 6' 10" high and 12' 1" wide 6h x 7w cubits. 4He measured the front of the nave at 34' 6" 20 cubits square He told me, "This is the Holy Place."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He measured the Temple wall at 10' 4"' 6 cubits and the width of the side rooms at 6' 11" 4 cubits all around the Temple. 6The side rooms were three stories high, 30 rooms on each floor. They extended to the wall on their inside all around so they could be fastened and not be fastened into the wall of the Temple. 7The side rooms surrounding the Temple were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the Temple went up by stages on all sides of it, the width of the Temple increased as it went higher. So one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the second story. 8I saw also that the Temple had a raised platform all around. The foundations of the side rooms were 10' 4" 6 long cubits. 9The outer wall of the side rooms was 8' 7" 5 cubits thick. But the space between the side rooms belonging to the Temple 10and the outer rooms was 34' 6" 20 cubits wide all around the Temple. 11The doorways of the side rooms opened onto the part of the platform that was left free, one door to the north and one to the south. The width of the part that was left free was 8' 7" 5 cubits all around.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The building in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was 105ft wide. The building's wall was 8' 7" 5 cubits thick all around, and it was 155' 3"long 90 cubits. 13Then he measured the Temple at 172' 5" 100 cubits long. The separate area with the building and its walls was also 172' 5" 100 cubits long. 14The front of the Temple and the separate area along the east side were 172' 5" 100 cubits.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side at 172' 5" 100 cubits. 	Ezek 41:12-15a He also measured the inner nave and the porches of the court. 16The nave of the Temple, the inner room, and the outer vestibule were paneled. Around all three there were windows with recessed frames. The threshold was paneled with wood all around from the floor to the windows (which were covered), 17to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. On all the walls round about in the inner room and the nave were carved likenesses 18of cherubs alternating with palm trees. Each cherub had two faces: 19the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole Temple round about. 20From the floor to above the door, cherubs and palm trees were carved on the wall.			Ezek 41:15b-20</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The doorposts of the nave were square. In front of the Holy Place was something like 22an altar of wood 3' 5" x 3' 5" x 5' 2" 2 x 2 x 3 cubits tall. Its corners, base, and sides were wood. He said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD." 23The nave and Holy Place each had a double door. 24The doors had two swinging leaves apiece. 25On the doors of the nave were carved cherubs and palms trees, such as were carved on the walls. There was a wood canopy in front of the vestibule outside. 26There were recessed windows and palm trees on each side on the side walls of the vestibule.</span>
