## Ezekiel Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong>The</strong><strong> twelfth day, tenth month, tenth year</strong>, a message from the LORD came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>I’ll</em><em> put hooks in your jaws</em> <em>	and make the fish in your streams cling to your scales.</em> <em>I’ll drag you out on the shore</em> <em>	with fish clinging to your scales.</em><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>I’ll</em><em> abandon you to the wilderness,</em> <em>	you and the fish in your streams.</em> <em>You’ll fall in the open field</em> <em>	and not </em><em>be buried</em><em>.</em> <em>I’ll make you food for scavengers on the ground</em> <em>	and buzzards from the sky.</em></span>

### 8‘So the Lord GOD says, “I’m going to bring a sword against you, and slay people and animals. 9Because you said, ‘The Nile belongs to me, I made it,’ 10I’m against you and your streams. Egypt will become a wasteland from Migdol to Syene to the border of Nubia. 11People and animals won’t travel through it; nobody will live there for 40 years. 12So I’ll make Egypt desolate among desolate lands and its cities desolate among desolate cities for 40 years. I’ll scatter the Egyptians among the nations.  13‘The Lord GOD says, “After 40 years, I’ll gather the Egyptians back from where they’ve scattered. 14I’ll return their fortunes and make them go back to the land of Pathros and become a minor kingdom there. 15Egypt will be low among the kingdoms and never again raise itself above them. I’ll make it too small for that. 16Israel will never rely on it again. They’ll be reminded of their sin in going back to Egypt. They’ll know I’m the Lord GOD.”’ 	  Ezek 29:8-16
