## Ezekiel Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The twelfth day, tenth month, tenth year, a message from the LORD came to me: 2"Son of man, turn toward Pharaoh, Egypt's king, and prophesy against him and Egypt. 3Say,'The Lord GOD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll put hooks in your jaws</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'll abandon you to the wilderness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then you residents in Egypt will know I'm the LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When he took hold of you, 8'So the Lord GOD says, "I'm going to bring a sword against you, and slay people and animals. 9Because you said, 'The Nile belongs to me, I made it,' 10I'm against you and your streams. Egypt will become a wasteland from Migdol to Syene to the border of Nubia. 11People and animals won't travel through it; nobody will live there for 40 years. 12So I'll make Egypt desolate among desolate lands and its cities desolate among desolate cities for 40 years. I'll scatter the Egyptians among the nations. 13'The Lord GOD says, "After 40 years, I'll gather the Egyptians back from where they've scattered. 14I'll return their fortunes and make them go back to the land of Pathros and become a minor kingdom there. 15Egypt will be low among the kingdoms and never again raise itself above them. I'll make it too small for that. 16Israel will never rely on it again. They'll be reminded of their sin in going back to Egypt. They'll know I'm the Lord GOD."'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The first day, first month, twenty-seventh year, a message from the LORD came to me: 18"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made his army struggle hard against Tyre. Every head became bald, and every shoulder was rubbed raw. But he and his army didn't get enough from Tyre to pay for the struggle. 19So I'll give him Egypt so he can carry off its wealth, capture its spoil, and seize its plunder to pay his army. 20I've given him Egypt for his struggle because he acted on my behalf. 21At that time, I'll make a horn sprout for Israel and open your mouth among them. They'll know I'm the LORD."</span>
