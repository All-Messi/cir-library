## Ezekiel Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sing this funeral song for Israel's officials:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When she brought up one of her cubs,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then nations heard about him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He walked among the lions;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He destroyed their fortresses</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then nations attacked him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> With hooks they put him in a cage</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Its strong stems became rulers' scepters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But it was plucked up in fury</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Now it stands in the wilderness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The fire that broke out in its branches</span>
