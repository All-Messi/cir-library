## Ezekiel Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The first day, twelfth month, twelfth year, a message from the LORD came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The Lord GOD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll dash you to the ground,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'll scatter your bodies on the mountains</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The land will soak up your blood</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When I blot you out,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll darken the lights in the sky above you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll trouble many nations when I take you captive among them to lands you haven't known. 10They'll be appalled at what's happened to you. Because of you, their kings will be horribly afraid when I brandish my sword at them. When you fall, they'll shudder every minute for their own life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The Lord GOD says, "The sword of Babylon's king will come on you. 12I'll make your large army fall by the swords of powerful men, all of them tyrants over nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll destroy its livestock from beside the waterways;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll make their waterways soak up the water</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When I make Egypt desolate</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> That's the dirge the nations will chant over Egypt and its army."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The fifteenth day, first month, twelfth year, a message from the LORD came to me: 18"Son of man, wail for Egypt's army. Along with the powerful nations, take it down to the nether world with those who go down to the Pit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They'll fall among those slain by the sword. Egypt will be delivered to the sword; they'll take it and its army away. 21Out of Sheol the strong among the powerful will talk about Egypt and its allies. 'The uncircumcised have gone down, they lie still, slain by the sword.' 22"Assyria is there with all its company, all slain by the sword. 23They who had spread terror among the living lie in the most remote parts of the Pit, 24"Elam is there with its army around its grave, all of them fallen by the sword. They who had spread terror among the living bore their disgrace with the ones they sent down to the Pit. 25They've made a bed for Elam among the slain—all uncircumcised. 26"Meshech, Tubal, and their armies are there, their graves around them, all slain by the sword, uncircumcised, though they'd spread terror among the living. 27They don't lie beside the fallen heroes of old, the uncircumcised who went down to Sheol with their weapons, whose swords were laid under their heads, whose shields rested on their skeletons. Though the living once feared them, 28they'll be broken among the uncircumcised and lie with the ones they'd slain. 29"Edom is there, its kings and princes, who, despite their power, lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword with those who go down to the Pit. 30"All the chiefs from the north are there too, and all the Sidonians, who, for the terror resulting from their power, went down in disgrace with the ones they'd slain. They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> The Lord GOD says, "Pharaoh will see them and be comforted for his army slain. 32Though I had spread the fear of him among the living, he and his army will lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword."</span>
