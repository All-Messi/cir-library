## Ezekiel Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from the LORD came to me: 2"Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother. 3They carried on prostitution in Egypt when they were young. Their breasts were pressed there and their virgin bosom was handled. 4Their names were Oholah the older and Oholibah her sister. They became mine and had children. Samaria is Oholah; Jerusalem is Oholibah. 5"Oholah played the prostitute while she belonged to me, and doted on her lovers, the Assyrians, her neighbors, 6who dressed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on their horses. 7She bestowed her prostitution on them, choice men of Assyria. She defiled herself with their idols. 8She didn't abandon her prostitution from the time she was in Egypt. When she was young, men had lain with her, and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her. 9So I gave her to her lovers, the Assyrians. 10They uncovered her nakedness; they took her children but killed her with a sword. So she became a byword among women, and they carried out judgments on her. 11"Her sister Oholibah saw that and became even more corrupt in doting on her lovers. Her prostitution was worse than her sister's. 12She doted on the Assyrians, nearby governors and officials, magnificently attired, horsemen riding horses, all desirable young men. 13I saw that she'd defiled herself; they both had followed the same path. 14So she increased her prostitution. She saw men painted on the wall, images of Babylonians painted with vermilion, 15wearing waistbands, with flowing turbans on their heads, all looking like officers, like Babylonians in Babylonia, the land where they were born. 16When she saw them, she doted on them and sent messengers to them in Babylonia. 17The Babylonians came to her bed of lust and defiled her with their prostitution. When they'd defiled her, she became disgusted with them. 18She uncovered her prostitution and her nakedness. Then I became disgusted with her like I had with her sister. 19She still increased her prostitution and remembered her youth when she carried on prostitution in Egypt. 20She doted on her paramours, whose members are like donkeys' and whose issue is like horses'. 21So she longed for the lewdness of her youth when the Egyptians handled her young breasts. 22"So, Oholibah, the Lord GOD says, 'I'll arouse your lovers against you—the ones you're alienated from—and bring them against you from every direction: 23the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans; Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and the Assyrians, desirable young men, governors and officials all, officers and soldiers every one, riding horses. 24They'll attack you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and an army of soldiers arrayed against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet. I'll let them judge you by their customs, 25and I'll direct my jealousy against you in anger. They'll cut off your nose and ears, and any survivors will fall by the sword. They'll capture your children and burn your survivors. 26They'll strip off your clothes and take your beautiful jewels. 27That's how I'll stop your lewdness and prostitution with Egypt so you won't look up to it or remember it anymore. 28I'll turn you over to the ones you despise, people you're alienated from. 29They'll deal with you in hate, take your property, and leave you naked. 30Your lewdness and prostitution will be exposed. 31You've followed your sister's ways; so I'll give you her cup to drink.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> You'll be filled with drunkenness and distress:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> You'll drink it and drain it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Because you've thrown me away and forgotten me, take the punishment for your lewdness and prostitution.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The LORD said: "Son of man, will you willing to judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then remind them of their detestable acts. 37Say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> You've defiled my sanctuary</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> The very day you killed your children for your idols,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The sound of debauchery surrounded you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Then I said about you women</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> But they slept with you like prostitutes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> But good men will condemn you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> That's how I'll stop lewdness in the land.</span>
