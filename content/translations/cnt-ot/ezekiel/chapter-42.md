## Ezekiel Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he took me north to the outer court, to the rooms across from the Temple yard and the north building. 2The length of the building on the north side was 172' 5" x 86' 3" 50 x 100 cubits. 3Beside the 34' 6" 20 cubits that belonged to the inner court and facing the pavement of the outer court, there was a three-story gallery. 4In front of its rooms was an inner walkway 17' 3" wide x 172' 5" long 10 x 100lcubits with doorways on the north. 5The upper rooms were narrower, because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle floors of the building. 6The rooms had three stories and didn't have any pillars like the pillars in the courts. So the upper rooms were set back more than the lower two levels. 7The outer wall beside the rooms toward the court was 86' 3" 50 cubits long. 8The rooms in the outer court were 86' 3" 50 cubits long. The rooms facing the Temple were 172' 5" 100 cubits long. 9Below those rooms, was the east entrance as you enter them from the outer court, where the outside wall begins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> On the east across from the yard and the building there were rooms 11with a passage in front of them. They were like the rooms on the north with the same length and width and with the same exits, arrangements, and doors. 12Below the south rooms, there was an entrance on the east side—where a person goes into the passage—and across from them there was a dividing wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then he told me, "The north and south rooms, across from the separate area, are holy rooms where the priests that are near the LORD are to eat the most holy things. They'll lay the most holy things there—the grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering; because the place is holy. 14When the priests go in, they're not to go out to the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there the holy vestments that they minister in. They'll put on other clothes so they can go to the parts of the building that's open to the public."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When he'd finished measuring the inside of the Temple, he took me out through the east gate, and measured all the way around the Temple: 165170' 500 reeds on the east, 17north, 18south, and 19west sides. 20The Temple had a wall all the way around it, 5170' 500 reeds long in both directions, to separate the holy from the common.</span>
