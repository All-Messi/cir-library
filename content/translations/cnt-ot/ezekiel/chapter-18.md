## Ezekiel Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from the LORD came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> As I live, you won't be using that proverb in Israel anymore. 4Every soul belongs to me, the parent's as well as the children's. The soul that sins is the one that dies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Because the father practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what wasn't good, he'll die for his own sins. 19"Yet you say, 'Why shouldn't a child take the punishment for a parent's sins?' When children practice goodness and observe my statutes, they'll live. 20The one that sins is the one that dies. An offspring won't take the punishment for a parent's sins or vice versa. A person's goodness or sinfulness applies to the one that does it. 21"If sinful people quit sinning, keep my statutes, and practice goodness, they'll live. 22The sins they've committed I won't hold against them. Because they're practicing goodness now, they'll live. 23Do I get any satisfaction out of seeing a sinner die," the Lord GOD says, "instead of turning from sin and living? 24"But when good people turn away from their goodness, and do what sinful people do, will they live? I won't consider their good deeds before; they'll die for the treachery they're committing now. 25Yet you say the LORD's way's not right. Listen, Israel! Aren't your ways the ones that aren't right? 26When good people turn away from their goodness, they'll die in their sin. 27When sinful people quit sinning and practice what's right, they'll save their life. 28They'll live because they thought it over and turned away from their sin. 29But Israel says, 'The LORD's way isn't right.' Aren't my ways right, Israel? Aren't your ways the ones that aren't? 30"So I'll judge you, Israel, each person by their own behavior. Repent and quit sinning so your sins won't make you stumble. 31Get rid of them. Make a new heart and spirit for yourselves! Why die, Israel? 32I don't get any satisfaction out of seeing somebody die. So repent and live."</span>
