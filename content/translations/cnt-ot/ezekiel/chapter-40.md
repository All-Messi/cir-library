## Ezekiel Chapter 40

### VISION OF THE NEW TEMPLE AREA

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At the <strong>beginning of the twenty-fifth </strong><strong>year of our exile,</strong> <strong>tenth month, fourteenth year</strong> after the city fell, the LORD’s hand weighed heavy on me. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>In visions he took me to Israel and set me on a tall mountain. On it to the south was a structure like a city. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He took me over there. Standing in the gate was a bronze-looking man with a flax line and a measuring rod in his hand. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He told me, <em>“Son of man, </em><em>look</em><em>, </em><em>listen, p</em><em>ay attention to everything I show</em><em> you. T</em><em>hat’s why </em>the LORD<em> brought </em><em>you </em><em>here.</em><em> </em><em>Tel</em><em>l</em><em> Israel everything you see.”</em><strong></span>

### The East Gate


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> There was a wall all the way around the Temple. The man holding a measuring rod (10' 4" long, each cubit being 17.72" ordinary cubit plus 2.95" ordinary palm = 20.8" royal cubit) measured the thickness and height of the wall at 10' 4" <sup>1 reed </sup>each. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then he went to the east gate, up its steps, and measured its threshold at 10' 4" <sup>1 reed</sup> wide and deep. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The guard rooms were 10' 4" <sup>1 reed </sup>square with 8' 7" <sup>5 cubits </sup>between them. The threshold of the gate facing inward was 10' 4" <sup>1 reed</sup>, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and the porch of the gate facing inward was 10' 4" <sup>1 reed</sup>. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He measured the porch of the gate at 13' 10" <sup>8 cubits</sup>; the porch of the gate faced inward. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>There were 3 guardrooms on each side of the gate, all the same size. The side pillars were square. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The opening of the gate was 17' 3" <sup>10 cubits</sup> wide and 20' 5" <sup>13 cubits </sup>deep. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>There was a barrier wall in front of the guardrooms 21" <sup>1 cubit</sup> thick on each side, and the guardrooms were 10' 4" <sup>6 cubits</sup> square. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other as 43' 1" <sup>25 cubits </sup>wide from one door to the opposite door. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He made the side pillars 103' 6" <sup>60 cubits </sup>high. The gate extended around to the side pillar of the courtyard. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was 86' 3" <sup>50 cubits</sup>. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>There were beveled windows narrowing inward toward their side pillars within the gate all around; the same for the porches. The porch had windows all around inside, and the dividing walls were decorated with palm trees.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
