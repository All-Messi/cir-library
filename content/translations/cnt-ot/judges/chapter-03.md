## Judges Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The LORD left those nations to test the Israelites that hadn’t experienced war in Canaan. [<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The nations were the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, Sidonians, the Hivites on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>They served to test whether Israel would obey the LORD’s commandments to their ancestors by Moses. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They intermarried with them and served their gods. <strong>Othniel Judges Israel</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Israel forgot the LORD its God and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He was angry and sold Israel to Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for <strong>8 years</strong>. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When they appealed to the LORD, he raised up <strong>Othniel</strong> son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, to deliver them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The Spirit of the LORD stirred him up to judge Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim to him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The land had peace for <strong>40 years</strong>. Then Othniel died.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>	      </strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>The people sinned again, and the LORD strengthened Eglon, king of Moab. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He gathered the Amorites and Amalekites, defeated Israel, and took the City of Palms. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Israel served him for <strong>18 years</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>But when Israel appealed to the LORD, he raised up <strong>Ehud</strong> son of Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Ehud made a double-edged</span>

He said, “I have a message from God for you.” He got up from his seat. 21Ehud reached with his left hand, took his sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon’s belly. 22The hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade. He didn’t pull it out, and the refuse came out. 23Ehud went out to the anteroom, closed the doors to the roof room, and locked them. 	Jud 3:12-23
