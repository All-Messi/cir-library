## Judges Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah that none of them would give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin. 2The people came to Bethel and sat till evening in front of God and cried bitterly. 3"LORD God of Israel, why has this happened that a tribe should be missing from Israel?" 4The people got up early the next day, built an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 5They said, "Which tribe didn't come up to the assembly to the LORD?" They'd taken an oath at Mizpah to put to death anyone that didn't come up to the LORD. 6They felt sorry for Benjamin, their fellow Jews, "A tribe has been eliminated from Israel today. 7What are we going to do for wives for the ones that are left? We've sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters for wives."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They said, "What tribe didn't come up?" 9When the people mustered, not one person from Jabesh-gilead was there. 10The community sent 12,000 of their bravest men, "Go strike the people in Jabesh-gilead with the sword, including women and children. 11Destroy every male and every woman that has been with a man." 12They found 400 young virgins in Jabesh-gilead and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then the whole community sent word to Benjamin at the Rock of Rimmon to announce a truce. 14Benjamin came back, and they gave them the women they'd saved from Jabesh-gilead, but they weren't enough. 15The people had mercy on Benjamin because the LORD had created a division in the tribes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The elders of the community said, "What are we going to do for the rest of them? The women from Benjamin had been destroyed. 17There has to be an inheritance for the survivors so a tribe doesn't disappear. 18But we can't give them our daughters for wives." The people had sworn, "Anybody that gives a wife to Benjamin is under a course."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They said, "There's the annual festival of the LORD at Shiloh, north of Bethel, east of the road from Bethel to Shechem and south of Lebonah."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They told the Benjamites, "Lie in wait in the vineyards 21and watch. If the young women of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, each man come out of the vineyards, grab his wife, and go to Benjamin's land. 22When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we'll say, 'Grant them graciously to us because we didn't take wives for them in battle. You didn't give them wives; otherwise, you'd be guilty.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The Benjamites did that and took their wives according to their number from the dancers they carried off. They went back to their inheritance, rebuilt the towns, and lived in them. 24Each man of Israel went to his tribe and family, to his inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> In those days there wasn't a king in Israel. Everybody did what seemed right to them.</span>
