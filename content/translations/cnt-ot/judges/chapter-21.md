## Judges Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah that none of them<em> </em>would give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The people came to Bethel and sat till evening in front of God and cried bitterly. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>God of Israel, why has this happened that </em><em>a</em><em> tribe </em><em>should be missing from</em><em> Israel?</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The people got up early the next day, built an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They said, <em>“Which </em><em>tribe</em><em> didn’t come up to the assembly to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>?” </em>They’d taken an oath at Mizpah to put to death anyone that didn’t come up to the LORD. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They felt sorry for Benjamin, their fellow Jews, <em>“</em><em>A </em><em>tribe has been </em><em>eliminated</em><em> from Israel today.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>What are we going to do </em><em>for wives </em><em>for th</em><em>e ones</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> are left</em><em>? We’</em><em>ve sworn by the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>not to give them our daughters for wives.</em><em>”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 21:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>They said, <em>“What </em><em>tribe</em><em> didn’t come up?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When the people mustered, not one person from Jabesh-gilead was there. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The community</span>
<p class="section-ref">sent 12</p>

### ,000 of their bravest men, “Go strike the people in Jabesh-gilead with the sword, including women and children. 11Destroy every male and every woman that has been with a man.” 12They found 400 young virgins in Jabesh-gilead and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Then the whole community sent word to Benjamin at the Rock of Rimmon to announce a truce. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Benjamin came back, and they gave them the women they’d saved from Jabesh-gilead, but they weren’t enough. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The people had mercy on Benjamin because the LORD had created a division in the tribes.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 21:8-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>The elders of the community said, <em>“What are we going to do for the </em><em>rest of them? The women from Benjamin had been</em><em> destroyed</em><em>.</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>There has to be an inheritance</em><em> for the survivors so a tribe does</em><em>n’t </em><em>disappear</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>But we can’t give </em><em>them our daughters for </em><em>wives.” </em> The people had sworn, <em>“Anybody</em><em> that gives a wife to Benjamin</em><em> is under a course</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>They said, <em>“There’</em><em>s the </em><em>annual</em><em> </em><em>festival</em><em> of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> at Shiloh, north of Bethel, east of the </em><em>road</em><em> from Bethel to Shechem and south of Lebonah.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>They told the Benjamites, <em>“Lie in wait in the vineyards</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>and watch. I</em><em>f the </em><em>young women</em><em> of Shiloh come out to dance</em><em> in the dances</em><em>,</em><em> each man</em><em> come out of the vineyards</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>grab</em><em> his wife</em><em>,</em><em> and go to </em><em>Benjamin’s</em><em> land.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we’ll say,</em> <em>‘</em><em>Grant them graciously to us because we didn’t take </em><em>wives</em><em> for them in battle</em><em>. Y</em><em>ou didn’t </em><em>give them wives; otherwise, you’</em><em>d be guilty.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>The Benjamites did that and took their wives according to their number from the dancers they carried off. They went back to their inheritance, rebuilt the towns, and lived in them. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Each man of Israel went to his tribe and family, to his inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>In those days there wasn’t a king in Israel. Everybody did what seemed right to them. <strong>	</strong></span>
