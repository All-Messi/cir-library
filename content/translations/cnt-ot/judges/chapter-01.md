## Judges Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After Joshua died, the people asked the LORD, <em>“Who will go up first to fight the Canaanites?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He said, <em>“</em><em><u>Judah</u></em><em>.</em><em> I’ll</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> the land </em><em>to him</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Judah said to his brother <u>Simeon</u>, <em>“</em><em>Go with me to my</em><em> territory </em><em>to fight the Canaanites, and I’ll go with you </em><em>to </em><em>yours</em><em>.”</em> So he went with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Judah went up and the LORD delivered 10,000 Canaanites and Perizzites to him at Bezek. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><sup>-6</sup></strong>They attacked Adoni-bezek <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and he fled, but they caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table.</em><em> </em><em>God has done to me</em><em> </em><em>what I’ve done</em><em>.”</em> They took him to Jerusalem, where he died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Judah fought Jerusalem and took it. They struck it with the sword and set it on fire. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then they went down to fight the Canaanites in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Judah attacked the Canaanites in Hebron (called Kiriath<em>-</em>arba before) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.<strong>	 </strong><strong>Jud 1:1-10</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> From there they attacked Debir (called Kiriath<em>-</em>sepher before). <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Caleb said, <em>“Whoever </em><em>takes</em><em> Keriath-sepher</em><em>, I’ll give </em><em>my daughter</em><em> Achsah</em><em> as a wife.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, and <em>Caleb</em> gave her to him. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked, <em>“What do</em><em> you want</em><em> for yourself</em><em>?”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, moved from the City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad, and settled with the people. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Judah went with Simeon and defeated the Canaanites in Zephath and “destroyed” it; so the city was called Hormah. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, and their territories. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The LORD was with Judah, and he gained possession of the hill country, but he couldn’t drive out the people in the plain; they had iron chariots. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>They gave Hebron to Caleb, like Moses had said. He drove out Anak’s three sons. <strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 1:11-20</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But <u>Benjamin</u> didn’t drive out the Jebusites in Jerusalem; they still live there among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <u>Joseph</u> went up against Bethel and the LORD was with them. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Joseph’s house spied out Bethel (called Luz before). <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The spies saw a man coming out of the city, and said, <em>“S</em><em>how us </em><em>how </em><em>to get into</em><em> the city, and we’ll </em><em>have mercy on you</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He showed them. They struck it with the sword, but they let him and his family go. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He went to the Hittites and built a city he called Luz. That’s still its name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> <u>Manasseh</u> didn’t drive out the people in Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, or Megiddo and their villages. The Canaanites kept living there. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>When Israel grew stronger, they put them to forced labor; but they didn’t completely drive them out. <strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 1:21-28</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <u>Ephraim</u> didn’t drive out the Canaanites in Gezer, who kept living among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <u>Zebulun</u> didn’t drive out the people in Kitron or Nahalol, who kept living among them, subject to forced labor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> <u>Asher</u> didn’t drive out the people in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They lived among the Canaanites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> <u>Naphtali</u> didn’t drive out the people in Beth-shemesh or Beth-anath. They lived among those Canaanites, who became forced labor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> The Amorites pressed the <u>Dan</u>ites back into the hill country. They wouldn’t let them come down to the plain. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>They went on living in Mount Heres. Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But Joseph’s house pressed heavily on them and subjected them to forced labor. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and up.<strong>	 </strong><strong>Jud 1:29-36</strong> <strong>The Angel of the Lord Comes to Bokim</strong></span>
