## Judges Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The people came out from Dan to Beersheba, including Gilead, and gathered in unity to the LORD at Mizpah. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The chiefs from all the tribes presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people, 400,000 infantry that drew sword. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>(Now the Benjamites heard that the people had gone up to Mizpah.) They said, <em>“H</em><em>ow did this wickedness happen?”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The Levite, husband of the murdered woman, said, <em>“My concubine and I came to Gibeah, in Benjamin, to spend the night. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The men there rose against me and set on the house around me after dark. They meant to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she’s dead. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>I cut her up in pieces and sent them all over Israel because they’ve committed a detestable, disgraceful act. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>People of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The people arose in agreement, <em>“None of us will go to his tent</em><em> or</em><em> house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>We’ll go up against Gibeah by lot.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>e’ll take </em><em>10 men from</em><em> </em><em>100</em><em> from all the tribes, </em><em>100 from</em><em> </em><em>1,000</em><em>, </em><em>1,000 from</em><em> </em><em>10,000</em><em>, to bring provisions for the people,</em><em> so</em><em> when they come</em><em>,</em><em> they </em><em>can </em><em>pay back Gibeah f</em><em>or that awful crime</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>The tribes of Israel sent men through the whole tribe of Benjamin, and said, <em>“What’s this wickedness that’s taken place among you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Give up the base men of Gibeah, </em><em>so</em><em> we </em><em>can put them to death</em><em> and </em><em>purge sin</em><em> from Israel.”</em><em> </em>But the Benjamites wouldn’t listen. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They came together out of the towns to Gibeah to fight. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>That day they mus</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The people of Israel went up to Bethel and asked God, <em>“Which of us should </em><em>go up first to fight</em><em> Benjamin?”</em><em> </em>The LORD said, <em>“Judah.”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The people got up in the morning and camped against Gibeah. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>They went out to fight Benjamin and drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and f</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>So they attacked the Benjamites the second day. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day and f</span>

They sat in front of the LORD and fasted that day till evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD. 27(The Ark was there at that time, 28and Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron performed service in front of it.) They asked him, “Should we go up again against our fellow Jews?”  “Yes, I’ll deliver them to you tomorrow.”


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>On the third day, they went up against the Benjamites and set themselves in formation against Gibeah like before. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The Benjamites came out against them and drew away from the town. As at other times, they began to strike down and kill some people in the highways—one that goes up to Bethel, the other to Gibeah—and in the countryside,</span>

### men of Israel. 32The Benjamites said, “They’re routed like the first time.” But the men of Israel said, “Let’s retreat and draw them away from the town onto the highways.” 33They rose up out of their place and set themselves in formation at Baal-tamar, and the men lying in ambush rushed out of their place west of Geba. 3410,000 elite men out of all Israel attacked Gibeah. The battle was hard, but the Benjamites didn’t know that disaster was coming. 35The LORD defeated Benjamin in front of Israel. Israel destroyed 25,100 Benjamite swordsmen that day. 36Then the Benjamites realized they were defeated.	Jud 20:24-36a  The men of Israel gave ground, because they relied on the ones in ambush to attack the town. 37The men in ambush hurried out and struck the whole town with the sword. 38The signal by the men in ambush was that when they made a big cloud of smoke rise out of the town, 39the men of Israel should turn around in battle. Benjamin said, “We’ve struck them down like in the first battle.” 40But when the signal began to rise, the Benjamites looked back. The whole town was going up in smoke. 41Then Israel turned around and Benjamin panicked when they saw that disaster was on them. 42So they turned their backs on Israel toward open country, but the battle overtook them. Those who came out of the towns 43cut them down and pursued them down from Nohah all the way across from Gibeah to the east. 4418,000 Benjamites fell. 45They turned and fled toward the open country to the Rock of Rimmon. On the roads they cut down 5,000 more and pursued them hard to Gidom and killed another 2,000. 4625,000 Benjamites fell that day, trained soldiers. 47But 600 fled toward open country to the Rock of Rimmon and stayed there four months. 48The men of Israel turned back and struck them with the sword, people and animals and everybody they found. They set on fire the towns they found.	Jud 20:36b-48  Wives for Benjamites
