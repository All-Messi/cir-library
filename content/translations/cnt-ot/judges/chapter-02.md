## Judges Chapter 2

### The Angel of the Lord Comes to Bokim

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, <em>“I brought you</em><em> up from Egypt </em><em>to this land that I swore to giv</em><em>e </em><em>your ancestors.</em><em> </em><em>I said</em><em>,</em> <em>‘I’ll n</em><em>ever break my covenant with you. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Don’t </em><em>make any covenant with the </em><em>people here</em><em>.</em><em> Tear</em><em> down their altars.’</em><em> </em><em>But you</em><em> haven’t </em><em>obeyed me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>So I won’t drive them out.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll become adversaries, and their gods will be a snare to you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When the angel of the LORD told the people that, they “cried” out loud. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They called the place Bochim and sacrificed to the LORD there. 	<strong>The Death of Joshua</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Joshua dismissed the people to their inheritances, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>they served the LORD while he was alive and the elders that outlived him, who’d seen the LORD’s great work for Israel. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He died at 110. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They buried him in his inheritance in Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>That whole generation passed on to their ancestors, and another generation grew up that hadn’t known the LORD or seen his work for Israel.</span>

### Disobedience and Defeat


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The people did sin and served the images of Baal <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and Ashtoreth <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and forsook their ancestors’ God. They worshiped the gods of people around them. That made the LORD angry; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>so he let plunderers sell them to their enemies so they couldn’t stand against them any longer. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Whenever they marched out, he opposed them like he’d sworn. They were in dire straits.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then the LORD raised up judges to save them from their plunderers, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>but they wouldn’t listen to them. They carried on prostitution with other gods and soon turned aside from the way their ancestors lived. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with him and saved them as long as the judge was alive. He took pity on their groaning. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>But whenever the judge died, they’d turn back and do worse than their ancestors and wouldn’t quit. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The LORD was angry and said, <em>“</em><em>They’ve sinn</em><em>ed </em><em>against </em><em>my covenant </em><em>like</em><em> their ances</em><em>tors.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>From </em><em>now on</em><em>,</em><em> I won’</em><em>t drive out any</em><em> </em><em>nation</em><em> Joshua left when he died.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>I’ll </em><em>use them to test</em><em> Israel </em><em>to see if</em><em> they’ll </em><em>follow</em><em> </em><em>me</em><em> like their </em><em>ancestor</em><em>s.”</em> [<strong><sup>23</sup></strong>]</span>
