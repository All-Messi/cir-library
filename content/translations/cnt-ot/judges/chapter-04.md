## Judges Chapter 4

### Deborah Judges Israel

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After Ehud died, the people sinned again, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and the LORD sold them to Jabin, king of Canaan in Hazor. Sisera commanded his army from Harosheth-hagoyim. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The people appealed to the LORD because <em>Sisera</em> had 900 iron chariots and oppressed Israel cruelly for <strong>20 years</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <strong>Deborah</strong>, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>She sat under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The people came up to her for judgment. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>She sent for <strong>Barak</strong> son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God of Israel commands you, ‘</em><em>G</em><em>ather to Mount Tabor </em><em>10,000 troops</em><em> from Naphtali and Zebulun.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I’</em><em>ll draw out Sisera,</em><em> Jabin’s </em><em>general</em><em>, to meet</em><em> you by the </em><em>Kishon </em><em>River </em><em>with his chariots and troops</em><em>. </em><em>I’ll give him to you.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Barak said, <em>“If you’ll go, I’ll go.</em><em> </em><em>If you won’t, I won’t.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“I’ll </em><em>go with you, but that</em><em> </em><em>won’</em><em>t </em><em>give</em><em> </em>you any <em>honor. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will </em><em>be </em><em>sell</em><em>ing</em><em> Sisera to a woman.”</em> She went with him to Kedesh, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; 10,000 men went up with him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 4:1-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, descendants of Hobab, Moses’ <em>brother</em>-in-law*. He had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim near Kedesh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When Sisera heard that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>he called out his 900 iron chariots and all his army from Harosheth-hagoyim to the Kishon River. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Deborah told Barak, <em>“Get u</em><em>p!</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>is going to deliver </em><em>Sisera</em><em> to you today</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Isn’t it the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> that’</em><em>s leading </em><em>you</em><em> out</em><em>?”</em> So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The LORD routed Sisera, his chariots, and army. Sisera jumped down from his chariot and fled on foot. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Barak chased the chariots and the army <em>back home </em>to Harosheth-hagoyim, and Sisera’s whole army fell by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Sisera fled to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, because he and Heber’s family had been on good terms. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Jael came out to meet him, <em>“Turn aside, </em><em>Sir. You don’t have to be afraid</em><em>.”</em> He turned aside into her tent, and she covered him with a rug. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Please</em><em> </em><em>give me a little water.</em><em> I’m thirsty.”</em> She opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him up. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Stand at the door</em><em>. I</em><em>f any</em><em>body comes and asks if </em><em>anybody</em><em>’s</em><em> here</em><em>,</em><em> say, ‘No.’”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>But she took a tent peg and a hammer, and went quietly to him and drove the peg into his temple till it stuck into the ground while he was asleep, exhausted. That’s how he died. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>As Barak pursued him, Jael went out to meet him, <em>“</em><em>Come here,</em><em> I’ll show you the man you’re looking for.”</em><em> </em>He went into her tent and found Sisera lying there dead with the tent peg through his temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> God subdued Jabin that day in front of Israel. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They kept pressing harder and harder on him till they’d destroyed him.</span>
