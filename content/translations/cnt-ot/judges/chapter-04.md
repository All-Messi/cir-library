## Judges Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After Ehud died, the people sinned again, 2and the LORD sold them to Jabin, king of Canaan in Hazor. Sisera commanded his army from Harosheth-hagoyim. 3The people appealed to the LORD because Sisera had 900 iron chariots and oppressed Israel cruelly for 20 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. 5She sat under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The people came up to her for judgment. 6She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, "The LORD God of Israel commands you, 'Gather to Mount Tabor 10,000 troops from Naphtali and Zebulun. 7I'll draw out Sisera, Jabin's general, to meet you by the Kishon River with his chariots and troops. I'll give him to you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Barak said, "If you'll go, I'll go. If you won't, I won't." 9"I'll go with you, but that won't give you any honor. The LORD will be selling Sisera to a woman." She went with him to Kedesh, 10and Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; 10,000 men went up with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law*. He had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim near Kedesh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When Sisera heard that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, 13he called out his 900 iron chariots and all his army from Harosheth-hagoyim to the Kishon River. 14Deborah told Barak, "Get up! The LORD is going to deliver Sisera to you today. Isn't it the LORD that's leading you out?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men. 15The LORD routed Sisera, his chariots, and army. Sisera jumped down from his chariot and fled on foot. 16Barak chased the chariots and the army back home to Harosheth-hagoyim, and Sisera's whole army fell by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Sisera fled to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, because he and Heber's family had been on good terms. 18Jael came out to meet him, "Turn aside, Sir. You don't have to be afraid." He turned aside into her tent, and she covered him with a rug. 19He said, "Please give me a little water. I'm thirsty." She opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him up. 20He said, "Stand at the door. If anybody comes and asks if anybody's here, say, 'No.'" 21But she took a tent peg and a hammer, and went quietly to him and drove the peg into his temple till it stuck into the ground while he was asleep, exhausted. That's how he died. 22As Barak pursued him, Jael went out to meet him, "Come here, I'll show you the man you're looking for." He went into her tent and found Sisera lying there dead with the tent peg through his temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> God subdued Jabin that day in front of Israel. 24They kept pressing harder and harder on him till they'd destroyed him.</span>
