## Judges Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In those days there wasn't any king in Israel. The tribe of Dan was looking for a territory to live in, because no inheritance in Israel had fallen to them yet. 2They sent out from Zorah and Eshtaol five capable men from their tribe to spy out the land and explore it. They happened to come to Micah's house and lodged there. 3While they were at his house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite and turned aside to him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing here?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The five men left and came to Laish and saw how the people lived in security, like the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing and possessing wealth. They saw how far they were from Sidon and had no dealings with anybody. 8When they came to their relatives at Zorah and Eshtaol, they asked them for their report. 9They said, "Let's go up against them. The land is fertile. Aren't you going to do anything? Don't hesitate to take the land. 10When you go, you'll come to an unsuspecting people. The land is extensive. Yes, God will give you the place that doesn't lack anything."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then 600 armed men from the tribe of Dan set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. 12They went up and "camped" at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That's why the place is still called Mahaneh-dan—west of Kiriath-jearim. 13They went on from there to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The five men that had spied out the country of Laish told their kin, "Did you know there are household idols, an ephod, a carved image, and a molten image in these houses? Think what you can do." 15They turned aside to the house of the young Levite at Micah's home and asked him how he was doing. 16The 600 armed Danites stood by the gate entrance, 17and the five men went in and took the carved image, ephod, household idols, and molten image, while the priest stood by the gate entrance with the 600 men. 18When they went into Micah's house and took those things, the priest asked, "What are you doing?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They told him, "Keep your voice down, cover your mouth, and come with us. Be a father and priest for us.  Is it better to be a priest for one man's house, or for a family and tribe in Israel?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The priest was happy. He took the ephod, household idols, and carved image and went in among the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So they turned around and left, putting their little ones, livestock, and goods in front of them. 22When they were a good way from Micah's house, the men in the houses close by were called out and overtook the Danites. 23They shouted at them. They turned around and said to Micah, "What ails you that you've come with such a crowd?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He said, "You take away the gods I made, and the priest, and what do I have left? What do you mean, 'What ails you?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The Danites said, "Don't raise your voice at us or angry fellows might fall on you. You'll lose your life and your family's lives."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The Danites left. Micah saw that they were too strong for him and went home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The Danites took what Micah had made and his priest, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the sword and burned the town. 28There wasn't any deliverer because it was too far from Sidon, and they didn't have dealings with anybody. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the town and lived in it. 29They renamed it Dan after their ancestor, Israel's son. 30They set up the carved image, and Jonathan son of Gershom son of Moses and his descendants were priests for the tribe of Dan till the time of the captivity. 31They set up the carved image Micah made for as long as God's house was at Shiloh.</span>
