## Judges Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel did what the LORD considered sin; so he gave them over to Midian for 7 years. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Because of Midian, the Israelites made dens and caves and barricades in the mountains. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Whenever they sowed anything, the Midianites, Amalekites, and people from the east would come up and attack them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’d camp against them and destroy their crops as far as the territory around Gaza. They wouldn’t leave any sustenance in Israel—sheep, oxen, or donkeys. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They’d come up with their livestock, camels, and tents like locusts in number. They trashed the land <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and brought Israel low. The people appealed to the LORD, <strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 6:1-6</strong> <strong>[</strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and he sent a prophet, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>God of Israel</em><em> says,</em><em> </em><em>‘</em><em>I led you out of </em><em>slavery in Egypt </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> delivered you from </em><em>other oppressors. I</em><em> drove them out and gave you their land.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I </em><em>told you, “</em><em><u>I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em> your God.</em><em> </em><em>Do</em><em>n’</em><em>t </em><em>be afraid of</em><em> the </em><em>Amorites’ </em><em>gods </em><em>where you’</em><em>re living.</em><em>” </em><em>But you</em><em>’ve ignored me</em><em>.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son <strong>Gideon</strong> was beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The angel appeared to him, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is with you, </em><em>brave soldier!</em><em>”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 6:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Gideon said, <em>“</em><em>Sir, if he’</em><em>s with us, why </em><em>i</em><em>s this happen</em><em>ing</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Where are his wonderful deeds our ancestors </em><em>talked about when he</em><em> br</em><em>ought</em><em> </em><em>us</em><em> up from Egypt?</em><em> He’</em><em>s </em><em>thrown</em><em> us </em><em>away now </em><em>and </em><em>delivered</em><em> us to Midian.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Gideon went into the house and fixed a kid and cakes without yeast from 1.1 bushels           <sup>1 </sup><sup>ephah</sup><sup> </sup>of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and took them to him under the terebinth tree. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God’s angel said, <em>“</em><em>Put</em><em> the meat and cakes on this rock and pour the broth over them.”</em>  When he did that, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>the angel touched the meat and cakes with the tip of his staff. Fire flared up from the rock and consumed them, and he vanished. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Then Gideon surmised that he was the angel of the LORD, <em>“Lord G</em><em>OD</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>I’ve seen the angel of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>directly</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But the LORD said, <em>You don’t have to be afraid</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>You won’t die.”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Then Gideon built an altar to him and called it The<em> </em>LORD<em> </em>Is<em> </em>Peace<em> </em>[<em>Yahveh Shalom</em>]. It’s still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> That night the LORD told him, <em>“Take your father’s bull</em><em> and a</em><em> second bull </em><em>seven</em><em> years old, and pull down </em><em>your father’s altar to Baal. C</em><em>ut down the </em><em>Asherah pole</em><em> beside it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Build</em><em> an a</em><em>ltar to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God on</em><em> top of the </em><em>fortress</em><em> here, with stones laid in order.</em><em> Offer</em><em> the second bull as a burnt offering wi</em><em>th the wood from the Asherah pole </em><em>you cut down.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Gideon took ten servants and did that. He was too afraid of family and townspeople to do it in the daytime, so he did it at night.<strong>	 </strong><strong>Jud 6:19-27</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When people in town got up early, Baal’s altar was pulled down, the Asherah pole was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar <em>Gideon</em> built. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They asked one another who<em> </em>did it<em>.</em> After they asked around, <em>people</em> said, <em>“Gideon son of Joash</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They told Joash, <em>“Bring your son out</em><em> to die. H</em><em>e </em><em>pulled</em><em> down </em><em>Baal’s</em><em> altar and cut down the </em><em>Asherah pole</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Joash said to everybody lined up against him, <em>“Will you defend Baal or his cause?</em><em> </em><em>Whoever fights for him </em><em>will be put to death</em><em> by morning.</em><em> </em><em>If he’s a god, </em><em>he can</em><em> defend himself</em><em>. It’s</em><em> his altar </em><em>that </em>Gideon<em> tore down!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 6:28-31</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That day he called him Jerubbaal (“Let Baal Fight Him”) because he tore down his altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then the Midianites, Amalekites, and people east <em>of</em> <em>the Jordan</em> joined forces, crossed the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>The Spirit of the LORD stirred up Gideon. He blew the ram’s horn and called the Abiezrites to follow him. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>He sent messengers all over Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to follow him too. They went up to meet them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then Gideon said to God, <em>“</em><em>If you’re going to </em><em>deliver Israel by </em><em>me</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>I’m laying a </em><em>wool </em><em>fleece on </em><em>the threshing floor. If there’s</em><em> dew on </em><em>it</em><em> </em><em>but</em><em> the ground</em><em> around it’s dry</em><em>, I’</em><em>ll know you’</em><em>ll deliver Israel by </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> That’s what happened. When he got up early, he wrung out enough dew to fill a bowl. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Then he said to God, <em>“Don’t be an</em><em>gry with me. L</em><em>et me </em><em>test </em>you<em> one </em>more <em>time with the</em><em> fleece. Let it be dry and</em><em> the ground </em><em>around it have</em><em> dew</em><em> on it</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> That’s what God did that night. It was dry just on the fleece; the ground was wet.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
