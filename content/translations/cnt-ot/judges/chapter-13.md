<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> A man named Manoah in Zorah from the tribe of Dan had a wife that couldn’t have children. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The angel of the LORD appeared to her, <em>“</em><em>You haven’t been able to </em><em>have children, but you’ll </em><em>have</em><em> a son.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Make sure</em><em> not to drink wine or </em><em>alcohol, or eat anything ceremonially unclean.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou</em><em>r </em><em>son</em><em> is not to shave his head. He’l</em><em>l be a Nazirite to </em><em>me</em><em> from birth and </em><em>begin </em><em>deliver</em><em>ing</em><em> Israel from the Philistines.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> She went and told her husband, <em>“</em><em>A man of G</em><em>od came to me</em><em>. He</em><em> </em><em>looked</em><em> like </em><em>an angel of</em><em> God, really awesome.</em><em> </em><em>I didn’t ask him where he was from, and he didn’t tell me his name</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>H</em><em>e said, ‘You’ll </em><em>have</em><em> a son; don’t drink wine or </em><em>alcohol</em><em>, or eat anything </em><em>ceremonially </em><em>unclean, because </em><em>he’ll</em><em> be a Nazirite to </em><em>me</em><em> from birth to </em><em>death.’”</em><strong>             </strong><strong>Jud 13:1-7</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Manoah pleaded with the LORD, <em>“</em><em>Please</em><em> let the man you sent come again and teach us what to do with the boy.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>His angel came again while she was sitting alone in the field. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>She ran and told Manoah, <em>“The man that came to me the other day has appeared to me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Manoah got up and followed her, <em>“Ar</em><em>e you the man that talked to her</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“</em><em>W</em><em>hen your </em><em>promise</em><em> come</em><em>s</em><em> true, </em><em>how should the boy live? W</em><em>hat’s he supposed to do?</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <em><sup>“</sup></em><em>Make sure to</em><em> do everything I told her.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>She</em><em>’s not to</em><em> eat an</em><em>ything from the grapevine.

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>“Let me detain you and fix </em><em>you </em><em>a</em><em> kid</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“If you detain me, I won’t ea</em><em>t your food. If you prepare a burnt offering, </em><em>offer it to the </em>LORD<em>.”</em> (Manoah didn’t know he was the angel of the LORD.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“What’s your name</em><em>,</em><em> so when your </em><em>promise</em><em> come true, we can honor you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“Why ask </em><em>what my name is? You can’t understand it.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Manoah took the kid with its grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, who worked wonders while Manoah and his wife watched. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When the flame went up from the altar, the angel of the LORD went up in it. They fell on their faces on the ground.<strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The angel of the LORD never appeared to them again. Then Manoah realized he was the angel of the LORD. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He told his wife, <em>“</em><em>We going to die! W</em><em>e’ve seen God.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But she said, <em>“If he </em><em>meant to kill us, he wouldn’t have</em><em> accepted our burnt offering and </em><em>grain o</em><em>ffering. He wouldn’t have shown us tho</em><em>se things or </em><em>told</em><em> us </em><em>such </em><em>things.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>She had a son and named him <strong>Samson</strong>. He grew and the LORD blessed him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span>
