## Judges Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The men of Ephraim gathered an army, crossed over <em>the Jordan </em>to Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, <em>“Why did you cross over to fight the Ammonites and not call us to go with you?</em><em> </em><em>We’ll burn your house </em><em>on top of</em><em> you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Jephthah told them, <em>“</em><em>M</em><em>y people </em><em>and </em><em>I</em> <em>had a </em><em>major</em><em> </em><em>conflict</em><em> with the Ammonites.</em><em> </em><em>When I called you, you didn’t deliver me from them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>When I saw that you wouldn’t deliver me, I took my life in hand and crossed over against the</em><em>m</em><em>, and the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>delivered</em><em> them to me.</em><em> Why then have you come up </em><em>to fight me?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jephthah gathered the men from Gilead and struck Ephraim because they said, <em>“You Gileadites are refugees from Ephraim in</em><em> Ephraim and Manasseh.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Gileadites captured the Jordan fords. When a refugee from Ephraim asked to go across, the Gileadites would ask him if<em> </em>he was an Ephraimite<em>.</em> If he said, <em>“No,” </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>they’d tell him to say <em>shibboleth.</em><em> </em>He’d say <em>s</em><em>ibbolet</em><em>h</em> because he couldn’t pronounce it right; so they’d kill him. At that time, 42,000 Ephraimites fell.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jephthah judged Israel <strong>6 years</strong>. He died and was buried in his city in Gilead.</span>
