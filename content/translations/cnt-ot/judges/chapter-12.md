## Judges Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The men of Ephraim gathered an army, crossed over the Jordan to Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight the Ammonites and not call us to go with you? We'll burn your house on top of you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Jephthah told them, "My people and I had a major conflict with the Ammonites. When I called you, you didn't deliver me from them. 3When I saw that you wouldn't deliver me, I took my life in hand and crossed over against them, and the LORD delivered them to me. Why then have you come up to fight me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jephthah gathered the men from Gilead and struck Ephraim because they said, "You Gileadites are refugees from Ephraim in Ephraim and Manasseh." 5The Gileadites captured the Jordan fords. When a refugee from Ephraim asked to go across, the Gileadites would ask him if he was an Ephraimite. If he said, "No," 6they'd tell him to say shibboleth. He'd say sibboleth because he couldn't pronounce it right; so they'd kill him. At that time, 42,000 Ephraimites fell.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jephthah judged Israel 6 years. He died and was buried in his city in Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 9He had 30 sons and gave 30 daughters in marriage outside his clan. He brought in 30 daughters from outside for his sons. He judged Israel 7 years. 10He died and was buried at Bethlehem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> After him Elon from Zebulun judged Israel for 10 years. 12He died and was buried at Aijalon in Zebulun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> After him Abdon son of Hillel from Pirathon judged Israel. 14He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons that rode on 70 donkeys. He judged Israel 8 years. 15He died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.</span>
