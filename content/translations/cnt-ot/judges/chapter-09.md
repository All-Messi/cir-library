## Judges Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Abimelech went to his mother’s relatives in Shechem and said to her clan, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Ask</em><em> </em><em>the leaders</em><em> in</em><em> Shechem</em><em> w</em><em>hich is better</em><em>:</em><em> for Jerubbaal’s </em><em>70</em><em> sons to rule you or for one </em>man <em>to rule </em><em>you. R</em><em>emember</em><em>,</em><em> I’m your flesh and bone.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>His mother’s relatives circulated that around for him, and the people were inclined to follow him <em>because</em> he was their<em> </em><em>kin</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They gave him 70 pieces of silver from Baal-berith’s temple. He used them to hire worthless, reckless fellows <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>to go with him to his father’s family at Ophrah and kill his 70 brothers on one stone. But Jotham, Jerubbaal’s youngest son, hid. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The people in Shechem and Beth-millo gathered and made Abimelech king by the Oak of the Pillar at Shechem. <strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 9:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When Jotham heard about it, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted, <em>“Listen, </em><em>people</em><em> of Shechem, so God will listen to you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The trees went </em><em>out</em><em> to anoint a king.</em><em> </em><em>They </em><em>asked</em><em> the olive tree</em><em> to r</em><em>ule </em><em>them</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>But the olive tree said, ‘</em><em>Should I leave my richness</em><em> that honors gods and </em><em>mortals, and go sway over the tree</em><em>s?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The trees said to the fig tree, ‘</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> come</em><em> and rule us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>But the fig tree said, ‘Should I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go sway over the trees?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The trees said to the </em><em>grape</em><em>vine, ‘</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> come and rule us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But the </em><em>grape</em><em>vine said, ‘Should I leave my wine that cheers gods and</em><em> mortals</em><em>, and go to sway over the trees?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Then the trees said to the bramble, ‘</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> come and rule us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>The bramb</em><em>le said, ‘If you’</em><em>re anointing me king</em><em> </em><em>in good faith</em><em>, then come and take refuge in my shade.</em><em> </em><em>If not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.</em> <em>“[</em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>]</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>M</em><em>y father fought for you and risked his life </em><em>to rescue you from Midian.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou’ve risen up against </em><em>his</em><em> </em><em>family</em><em> and killed his </em><em>70 </em><em>sons on one </em><em>rock. You’ve</em><em> made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king of Shechem because he’</em><em>s your relative. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f you’ve acted </em><em>honorably </em><em>in good faith with Jerubbaal and his </em><em>family</em><em> as his deeds deserv</em><em>ed</em><em>, the</em><em>n</em><em> </em><em>be happy with one another</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>If not, let fire come out from </em><em>Abimelech and consume the people in Shechem and Beth-millo.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jotham fled to Beer and lived there for fear of his half-brother. <strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 9:7-21</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Abimelech ruled Israel for <strong>3 years</strong>. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>God put animosity between him and the people in Shechem, and they dealt treacherously with him. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>That was </em>so the violence done to Jerubbaal’s 70 sons might come on Abimelech who murdered them and on the men who helped him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The men in Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops and robbed everybody that went by. Abimelech heard about it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Gaal son of Ebed moved to Shechem with his relatives and gained the confidence of the people there. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>They went out and gathered grapes from their vineyards, trod them, and held a feast. They went to the temple of their god and ate and drank, and ranted about Abimelech. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Gaal said, <em>“Who</em><em> is Abimelech? Why should we</em><em> serve him?</em><em> </em><em>Didn’t the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem?</em><em> </em><em>Why then should we serve </em><em><u>him</u></em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>If these</em><em> people were under my command</em><em>, </em><em>I’d remove Abimelech</em><em>! </em><em>I’d </em><em>tell</em><em> him</em><em> to muster an</em><em> army and come out</em><em> and fight</em><em>.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>      </strong><strong>  </strong><strong>Jud 9:22-2</strong><strong>9</strong><strong>  </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> When Zebul the ruler of the city heard what Gaal said, he was mad <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>and sent ambassadors to Abimelech at Arumah, <em>“Gaal and his relatives have come</em><em> to Shechem; they’</em><em>re stirring up the city against you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>So you and your men go during the night and lie in </em><em>ambush</em><em> in the fields.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>In the morning</em><em> at sun</em><em>up, rush </em><em>on </em><em>the city.</em><em> </em><em>When he and his men come out against you, do to them what you can.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Abimelech and his men got up during the night and laid in ambush against Shechem in four companies. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Gaal went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelech and his men rose up from the ambush. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>When Gaal saw them, he told Zebul, <em>“Look, men are coming down from the mountain</em><em>s</em><em>!”</em> Zebul said, <em>“You</em><em>’re</em><em> </em><em>just </em><em>see</em><em>ing</em><em> the mountains</em><em>’ </em><em>shadow</em><em>s</em><em>.”</em><em>   </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Gaal said again, <em>“Look, </em><em>there are </em><em>men are coming down from the center of the land, and </em><em>another</em><em> company is coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then Zebul said, <em>“</em><em>Where’</em><em>s your </em><em>bragging</em><em> now, you that said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’</em><em> </em><em>Aren’t these the men you despised?</em><em> </em><em>Go fight them.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Gaal led the men out to fight him. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Abimelech chased him and he fled. Many fell wounded all the way back to the entrance of the gate. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>Abimelech retreated to Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out of Shechem.<strong>	 </strong><strong>Jud 9:30-41</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The next day the men went out to the fields. Abimelech heard about it. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>He divided his men into three companies and laid in wait there. When the men come out of the city, he attacked them and killed them. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>Abimelech and his company rushed up and stood at the entrance to the city gate while the two companies attacked and killed the ones in the fields. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>Abimelech fought the city all day and took it. He killed the people in it, tore it down, and scattered salt all over it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> When people in the tower at Shechem heard about it, they withdrew into the fortress of El-berith’s temple. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>When Abimelech found out they were in the tower, <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>he and his men went up to Mount Zalmon. He cut a bundle of brush with an axe and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry<em> </em>and do the same thing<em>.</em> <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>Each one cut a bundle and followed him. He piled the bundles against the fortress and set it on fire over the ones inside. Everybody in the tower died, about 1,000 men and women.<strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 9:42-49</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against it, and took it. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>But the city had a strong tower. The men and women fled to it, shut themselves in, and went up to the roof. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>He attacked it and came to burn down the tower door. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>A woman threw an upper millstone down on him and cracked his skull. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>Right away he called to his young armor bearer, <em>“Draw your sword </em><em>and kill me so people wo</em><em>n’t</em><em> say</em><em> a</em><em> woman killed </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>His young man thrust him through, and he died. <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>When Israel saw Abimelech was dead, they went home. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>So God repaid him for his crime against his father in killing his 70 brothers. <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>God also made the sinfulness of the men in Shechem come back on their heads and made Jotham’s curse fall on them.<strong> </strong><strong>	Ju</strong><strong>d</strong><strong> </strong><strong>9:50-57</strong> <strong>Tola Judges Israel</strong></span>
