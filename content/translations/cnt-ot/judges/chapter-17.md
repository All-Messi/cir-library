## Judges Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A man named Micah in the hill country of Ephraim 2told his mother, "I took the 1,100 pieces of silver that were stolen from you, that you told me about and I heard you speak a curse on; I have them." She said, "May the LORD bless my son." 3He gave them back to her. She said, "I consecrate the silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a molten image. Now I'll return it to you." he gave 200 pieces of it to a silversmith to make a carved image and a molten image. It was in Micah's house. 5He had a shrine and appointed one of his sons as his priest. 6In those days, there wasn't any king in Israel. Everyone did what seemed right to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> A young Levite from the family of Judah was living temporarily in Bethlehem in Judah. 8He left to find a place to live. As he traveled, he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim. 9Micah asked him where he was from. 10"Stay with me. Be a father and a priest for me. I'll give you 10 pieces of silver a year, a suit of clothes, and living expenses."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The Levite was content to live with him and became like one of his sons. 12Micah installed the Levite as his priest in his house. 13Then he said, "Now I know the LORD will prosper me; I have a Levite as a priest."</span>
