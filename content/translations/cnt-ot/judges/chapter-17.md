## Judges Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A man named Micah in the hill country of Ephraim <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>told his mother, <em>“I took</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>he </em><em>1,100 pieces of silver that were stol</em><em>en from you, that </em><em>you told me </em><em>about</em><em> and I heard </em><em>you </em><em>speak</em><em> a curse </em><em>on; I have them</em><em>.”</em> She said, <em>“May t</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> bless my son.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He gave them back to her. She said, <em>“I consecrate the silver to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> for my son to make a </em><em>carved image and a molten image. Now I’ll return</em><em> it to you.”</em><em> </em>he gave 200 pieces of it to a silversmith to make a carved image and a molten image. It was in Micah’s house. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He had a shrine and appointed one of his sons as his priest. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>In those days, there wasn’t any king in Israel. Everyone did what seemed right to them.<strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 17:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A young Levite from the family of Judah was living temporarily in Bethlehem in Judah. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He left to find a place to live. As he traveled, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Micah asked him where he was from<em>.</em> <em>“I’m a Levite from Bethlehem</em><em> in</em><em> Judah</em><em>.</em><em> I’m going </em><em>away </em><em>to find a place</em><em> to live</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The Levite was content to live with him and became like one of his sons. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Micah installed the Levite as his priest in his house. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Then he said, <em>“Now I know the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will pros</em><em>per me; I have a Levite</em><em> as</em><em> a</em><em> priest.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>Jud 17:7-13</strong> <strong>Idolatry Among the Danites</strong></span>
