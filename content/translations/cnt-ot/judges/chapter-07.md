## Judges Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then Jerubbaal (Gideon) and the people got up early and camped beside the Spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was in the valley north of them by the Hill of Moreh.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>The LORD told Gideon, <em>“You hav</em><em>e too many for me to </em><em>deliver</em><em> </em><em>the Midianites to you.</em><em> I don’t want Israel to </em><em>pride themselves in thinking they’ve delivered themselves. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>ell </em><em>w</em><em>hoe</em><em>ver is afraid and trembl</em><em>ing</em><em> to</em><em> go home.”</em> Gideon tested them; 22,000 went back, 10,000 stayed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The LORD told Gideon, <em>“There are still too many.</em><em> </em><em>Take them down to the </em><em>creek;</em><em> I’ll test them</em><em>. </em><em>The one</em><em>s</em><em> I tell you, will go with you.</em><em> The others </em><em>won’t.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>He took them down to the water. The LORD told Gideon, <em>“</em><em>The ones that lap </em><em>water like </em><em>a dog, put in a group.</em><em> </em><em>Those who kneel</em><em> down to drink</em><em> put in another group</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>300 put their hands to their mouths. The rest got on their knees to drink from the water. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The LORD told Gideon, <em>“I’ll deliv</em><em>er the Midianites to you</span>

### men. Send the rest home.” 8He took the people’s jars and rams’ horns and sent the rest home. Midian camped below them in the valley.	          Jud 7:1-8


<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>That night the LORD told him, <em>“Get up and</em><em> go down against the camp</em><em>. I’ll</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> it to you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f you’re afraid, go down with your servant</em><em> Purah</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You’ll hear what they</em><em>’re</em><em> say</em><em>ing</em><em> and be </em><em>confident about attacking</em><em> the camp.”</em><em> </em> He went down with Purah to the outposts of the camp. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The Midianites, Amalekites, and people from east <em>of the Jordan </em>lay along the valley like locusts. Their camels were without number, like sand on the shore. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When Gideon got there, a man was telling his friend about a dream, <em>“I dreamed that a </em><em>loaf of barley bread tumbled into the </em><em>camp</em><em>. It knocked a tent over and </em><em>flat</em><em>tened it.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>His friend answered, <em>“That’</em><em>s the sword of Gideo</em><em>n, a man of Israel. God is going to deliver</em><em> Midian and </em><em>the </em>erst of the<em> army</em><em> to him</em><em>.” </em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 7:9-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed <em>in worship</em> and went back to camp. He said, <em>“Get up! The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>is going to deliver</em><em> Midian</em><em>’s army to you</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He divided</span>

### men into three companies. He gave them all rams’ horns and empty jars with torches inside. 17He told them, “Do what I do when I get to the edge of the camp. 18When I and the ones with me blow the rams’ horns, then blow your rams’ horns all around the camp, and raise the battle cry, ‘For the LORD and Gideon!’”

### got to the edge of the camp when they’d just set the middle watch. 20They blew the rams’ horns and broke the jars, holding the torches in their left hands and the rams’ horns in their right, and raised the battle cry, “A sword for the LORD and Gideon!” 21Every man stood in place all around the camp, and Midian’s whole army screamed and fled. 22When the Israelites blew the 300 rams’ horns, the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow soldier throughout Midian’s army. The army fled all the way to Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah by Tabbath. 23Gideon called out Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh to chase them. 24He sent messengers all over the hill country of Ephraim, “Come down against the Midianites and seize control of the water, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.” Ephraim came out and seized it. 25They captured Oreb and Zeeb, Midian’s two rulers. In the chase they killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They brought their heads to Gideon beyond the Jordan.	 Jud 7:15-25
