## Judges Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Samson went down to Timnah and saw a young Philistine woman. 2He came up and told his parents, "I saw a young Philistine woman at Timnah. Get her for me for a wife."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They said, "Isn't there a woman among your relatives or all our people that you have to marry a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> His parents didn't know it was all right with the LORD because he was looking for an occasion against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines controlled Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Samson went down to Timnah with his parents and came to the vineyards at Timnah. A young lion roared at him, 6and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him. Barehanded he tore the lion apart like it was a kid. 7He went down and talked to the woman, and she pleased him well. 8After a while, he went back to take her and turned aside to see the lion's carcass. There was a swarm of bees and honey in it. 9He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. He came to his parents and gave them some to eat; but he didn't tell them he got it out of the lion's carcass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> His father went down to the woman, and Samson held a feast there. That's the way young men used to do. 11When the people saw him, they brought 30 companions to be with him. 12Samson said to them, "Let me put a riddle to you. If you can figure it out and tell me during the week of the feast, I'll give you 30 linen tunics and 30 festive robes. 13If you can't, you'll give me that many."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He said, "Out of the eater came something to eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The fourth day, they told Samson's wife, "Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle means, or we'll burn you and your father's family. Have you invited us here to make us poor?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Samson's wife cried in front of him, "You just hate me, you don't love me. You've put a riddle to my countrymen and haven't told me what it means."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> She cried in his presence the week the feast lasted. The seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told her countrymen the riddle. 18The men of the city told him on the seventh day before the sun set,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The Spirit of the LORD came on him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed 30 men from the city. He took their spoil and gave the festive robes to the ones that told him the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father's house. 20So Samson's father-in-law gave his wife to his companion, who had been his best man.</span>
