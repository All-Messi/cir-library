## Judges Chapter **15**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After a while at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a kid. He said, <em>“I’ll </em><em>sleep with</em><em> my wife in </em>her<em> room.”</em> But her father wouldn’t let him go in, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“I thought you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion.</em><em> </em><em>Isn’t her younger sister better looking?</em><em> </em><em>Take her instead.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Samson told them, <em>“This time I’ll be blameless </em><em>for harming the Philistines</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

Jud 15:1-8


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The men in Judah said, <em>“Why have you come up against us?”</em><em> </em> They said, <em>“</em><em>We’ve come</em><em> to </em><em>tie up</em><em> Samson</em><em> and</em><em> do to him as he did to us.”</em><em> </em></span>

### ,000 men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock at Etam, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know the Philistines rule us? What have you done to us? 12We’ve come down to tie you up and give you to the Philistines.”  “Swear that you won’t fall on me yourselves.” 13“We’ll tie you up and give you to them. We won’t kill you.” So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.  	Jud 15:9-13


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him, and the Spirit of the LORD came on him powerfully. The ropes on his arms became like smoldering flax, and his bonds melted off his hands. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He found a fresh jawbone from a donkey and k</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>After he said that, he threw it away. That place was called Ramath<em>-</em>lehi [<em>Jawbone Hill</em>].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He was thirsty and “cried out” to the LORD, <em>“You’</em><em>ve granted </em><em>me this great deliverance. Am I to die from</em><em> thirst and fall into the hands of uncircumcised</em><em> men</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>God split open the hollow place that’s in Lehi, and water started coming out of it. When he drank it, his energy returned, and he revived. So he named it En<em>-</em>hakkore; it’s still at Lehi. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He judged Israel <strong>20 years</strong> during the time of the Philistines.<strong>	</strong></span>
