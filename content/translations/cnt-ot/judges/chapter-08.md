## Judges Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The men in Ephraim said to him, <em>“What have you done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?”</em> They were in animated contention with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He said, <em>“What </em><em>have I done compared to you? Isn’</em><em>t the gleaning </em><em>of grapes in</em><em> Ep</em><em>hraim better than the vintage in</em><em> Abiezer</em><em>? </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>God </em><em>delivered </em><em>O</em><em>reb and Zeeb to you. What have I</em><em> do</em><em>ne</em><em> </em><em>compared</em><em> </em><em>to that</em><em>?”</em><em> </em> They calmed down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Gideon and the 300 crossed the Jordan, exhausted from chasing. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He said to the men in Succoth, <em>“Give loaves of bread to the </em><em>ones</em><em> </em><em>with me. I’m afraid they’</em><em>re</em><em> worn out</em><em>, and I’m chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The officials in Succoth said, <em>“Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should </em><em>feed</em><em> your army?</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Gideon said, <em>“</em><em>All right, then. W</em><em>hen the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>delivers</em><em> </em><em>them to me</em><em>, I’ll fla</em><em>il you with wild briers and thorns</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He went on up to Penuel and asked them the same thing, and they answered the same way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told them, <em>“When I come back </em><em>after peace is restored</em><em>, I’ll </em><em>tear</em><em> down this tower.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 8:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about 15,000 men, what were left from the entire army from east <em>of the Jordan</em>; 120,000 swordsmen had fallen. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Gideon went up the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah and caught them in a surprise attack. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Zebah and Zalmunna fled. <em>Gideon</em> chased them and captured them and sent the whole army into a panic.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When he went back from the battle by the ascent of Heres, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>he captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him. He wrote down the <em>names of the </em>77 officials and elders in Succoth. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Gideon</em> came and said, <em>“</em><em>Look, </em><em>Zebah and Zalmunna that you taunted me about, ‘Are Ze</em><em>bah and Zalmunna already in </em><em>hand that we should </em><em>feed you</em><em>r </em><em>exhausted </em><em>men?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He disciplined the city elders with thorns and briers from the countryside. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men in the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He asked Zebah and Zalmunna,<em> “</em><em>What kind of</em><em> men </em><em>did you kill</em><em> at Tabor?”</em><em> </em> They answered, <em>“</em><em>E</em><em>very one of</em><em> them was like you, like </em><em>a king</em><em>’s son</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>He </em>said, <em>“They were my brothers, my mother</em><em>’s sons</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>As </em><em>sure as </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives, if you had </em><em>let them live, I wouldn’</em><em>t </em><em>have </em><em>kill</em><em>ed</em><em> you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He told Jether his firstborn to <em>get up and kill them.</em><em> </em> But the young man was afraid to draw his sword because he was young.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, <em>“</em><em>Be a man</em><em>.</em><em> Come do it yourself.</em><em>”</em><em> </em> Gideon got up and killed them and took the crescents off their camels’ necks.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 8:10-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then the Israelites said to him, <em>“Be our ruler, you, your son, and your grandson as well.</em><em> </em><em>You’ve delivered us from Midian.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> <em>“I</em><em> won’t</em><em> </em><em>be your </em><em>rule</em><em>r. My son won’t</em><em> </em><em>either</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>will b</em><em>e you</em><em>r ruler</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>L</em><em>et me </em><em>ask you for one thing, though. Each </em><em>of you </em><em>give me the earrings from your</em><em> spoil.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> <em>“</em><em>We’ll </em><em>be glad to</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>They spread out a cloak and every man tossed on it the earrings from his spoil. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The gold earrings weighed 50 pounds <sup>1700 shekels</sup> of gold plus the camels’ crescents. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Gideon made an ephod out of it and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. Israel prostituted themselves with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>So Israel subdued Midian; they didn’t threaten anymore. The land had peace for <strong>40 years</strong> during Gideon’s life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jerubbaal/<em>Gideon</em> went and lived in his own house. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He had 77 sons from many wives. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>A concubine of his in Shechem also had a son he named Abimelech. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Gideon died at a good old age, and they buried him in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah among the Abiezrites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As soon as he died, the people went back to worshiping the images of Baal. They made Baal-berith their god. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>They didn’t remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from their enemies in every direction, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>or show kindness to Jerubbaal’s family in return for everything he’d done for Israel.</span>
