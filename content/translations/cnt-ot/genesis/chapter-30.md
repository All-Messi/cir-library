## Genesis Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Rachel saw she wasn't having children, she became jealous of her sister and told Jacob, "Give me children, or I'm going to die!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Jacob's anger flared, "I'm not God, am I? He's the One that's kept you from having children!" 3"Here's my maid Bilhah. Sleep with her so I can have children through her"; 4so she gave him Bilhah as a wife. 5She became pregnant and had a son. 6Rachel said, "God has 'vindicated' me. He's heard me and given me a son"; so she named him Dan. 7Rachel's maidservant had a second son. 8So Rachel said, "I've 'wrestled' hard with my sister and won"; so she named him Naphtali.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When Leah saw she'd stopped having children, she gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. 10Zilpah had a son. 11Leah said, "How 'fortunate!'" so she named him Gad. 12Zilpah had a second son. 13Leah said, "I'm happy, and women will call me 'happy'"; so she named him Asher.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> During wheat harvest Reuben found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, "Give me some of your son's mandrakes." 15But she said, "Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? Would you take my son's mandrakes too?" 16When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, "You have to sleep with me; I've certainly hired you with my son's mandrakes"; he slept with her that night. 17God listened to Leah, and she had a fifth son. 18Leah said, "God has paid me my 'wages' because I gave my maid to my husband"; so she named him Issachar. 19She had a sixth son, 20"God has endowed me with a good gift. Now my husband will 'live with' me; I've had six sons for him"; so she named him Zebulun. 21Later she had a daughter she named Dinah. 22God remembered Rachel, listened to her, and opened her womb. 23So she had a son and said, "God has taken away my disgrace." 24She named him Joseph, "May the LORD give me 'another' son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> At the time when Rachel had Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Let me go now so I can return to my own country. 26Let me have the wives and little ones I've worked for. You know the work I've done for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> But Laban said to him, "If it pleases you, stay. I've seen that the LORD has blessed me because of you. 28Name your wages; I'll pay it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But Jacob said, "You know how I've worked for you and how your livestock fared with me. 30You didn't have much before I came, but it has increased to a big herd. The LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But when will I provide for my own family?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Laban asked, "What do you want me to give you?" "Don't give me anything. Do this, and I'll go on shepherding your flock: 32let me go through your entire flock today and take out every speckled and spotted sheep, black lamb, and speckled and spotted goat. That'll be my pay. 33So my honesty can answer for me later when you figure my pay, consider stolen each one with me that's not speckled and spotted among the goats or black among the lambs."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> That day, Jacob took out the striped and spotted male goats, the speckled and spotted female goats, the ones with white on them, and the black sheep. He gave them to his sons to take care of. 36Laban put three-days' distance between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 37Then Jacob took fresh poplar, almond, and plane stakes, and peeled white stripes around them. 38He set the peeled stakes in front of the flocks by the watering troughs where the flocks drank, and they mated when they came to drink. 39So the flocks mated by the stakes, and brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted young. 40Jacob separated the lambs and had the flocks face the striped and the black in Laban's flock. He set his own herds apart and didn't put them with Laban's. 41In addition, whenever the stronger ones in the flock were mating, Jacob would put the stakes by the troughs so the flock could see them so they'd mate by the stakes. 42But when the flock was weak, he didn't put them there; so the weaker ones were Laban's, and the stronger ones were Jacob's. 43Jacob became really prosperous with large flocks, with camels, donkeys, and male and female servants.</span>
