## Genesis Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <u>Amraphel</u> king of Shinar, <u>Arioch</u> king of Ellasar, <u>Chedorlaomer</u> king of Elam, and <u>Tidal</u> king of Goiim <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>fought <u>Bera</u> king of Sodom, <u>Birsha</u> king of Gomorrah, <u>Shinab</u> king of Adman, <u>Shemeber</u> king of Zeboiim, and the <u>king of Bela</u> (Zoar). <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Those <em>5</em> joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Dead Sea Sea). <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’d served Chedorlaomer for 12 years, then revolted. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>That year, he and his allied kings came and defeated the Rephaim in Asheroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and the Horites in Mount Seir, as far as El-paran by the open country. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then they turned back to En-mishpat (Kadesh) and conquered the Amalekites and Amorites in Hazazon-tamar. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (Zoar) pitched battle against them in the Valley of Siddim—<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>5 kings against 4. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The valley was full of tar pits. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them. The ones that survived escaped to the hills. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>The four kings</em> took the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and left. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They also took Lot and what he had because <em>he</em> was living in Sodom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> One man escaped to tell Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the Oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and Aner, Abram’s allies. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When Abram heard they’d captured his nephew, he mustered 318 trained men born in his house, and pursued <em>them</em> all the way to Dan. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He divided his men against them at night. He and his forces defeated them and chased them all the way to Hobah, north of Damascus. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He brought back the goods, Lot, and <em>Lot’s</em> possessions, along with the women and other captives.</span>

### Melchizedek Blesses Abram


<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When he got back from defeating Chedorlaomer and his allies, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (the King’s Valley). <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, brought out bread and wine <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and blessed Abram, <em>“</em><em>May you be blessed by</em><em> God Most High, </em><em>owner of earth and sky, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>who</em><em> delivered your enemies </em><em>to you</em><em>.”</em> <em>Abram</em> gave him a tenth of everything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The king of Sodom said to Abram, <em>“Give </em><em>me </em><em>t</em><em>he captives and keep the goods</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Abram said, <em>“I’ve sworn to </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God Most High, </em><em>owner of</em><em> earth and sky, </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>that I won’t take a thread, a </em><em>sandal thong</em><em>, or anything </em>else <em>that’s yours. I don’t want you to claim you made me rich. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>I’ll only take what the young fighting men have eaten, and the share that belongs to Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.”</em><em>	 </em><strong>Gen 14:17-24</strong> <strong>The L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong>’s</strong><strong> Covenant with Abram</strong></span>
