## Genesis Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Abram,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'll make you into a big nation, bless you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll bless the ones that bless you and curse the ones that curse you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Abram left when he was 75. 5He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, everything they owned, and the persons they'd gained in Haran. They got to Canaan, 6and Abram traveled through it as far as Shechem, to the Oak of Moreh. Canaanites were living in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The LORD appeared to Abram, "I'm going to give your descendants this land"; so he built an altar to him. 8He went on from there to the mountain east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to the LORD and called on him. 9He kept on migrating toward the Negev.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A severe famine arose in the land; so he went on down to Egypt to stay awhile. 11When he got close to Egypt, he told Sarai, "You're a beautiful woman. 12When the Egyptians see you, they'll say you're my wife and kill me. 13Say you're my sister so they will treat me well."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When Abram got to Egypt, the Egyptians did see she was really beautiful. 15Pharaoh's officials praised her to Pharaoh and took her to his palace. 16He treated Abram well out of regard for her, and gave him sheep, cattle, donkeys, male and female servants, and female donkeys and camels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of her. 18Pharaoh called Abram, "What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me she was your wife? 19Why did you say she was your sister; so I took her for my wife? Here's your wife; take her and get out." 20Pharaoh told his men to escort him away with his wife and everything he had.</span>
