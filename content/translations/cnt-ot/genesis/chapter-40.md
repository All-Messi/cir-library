## Genesis Chapter 40

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, the king's cupbearer and baker offended him. 2Pharaoh was furious 3and jailed them in the captain of the bodyguard's house, where Joseph was. 4The captain put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them for some time. 5The cupbearer and baker both had a dream the same night, each man's dream with its own meaning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw how dejected they looked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream, "I saw a vine 10that had three branches. It blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. 11I had Pharaoh's cup in my hand. I took the grapes and squeezed them into it and gave it to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Joseph said, "The three branches represent three days. 13In three days Pharaoh will put you back in office. You'll hand him the cup like before. 14Just keep me in mind when that happens and get me out of this house. 15I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I haven't done anything here that warranted putting me in the dungeon."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When the chief baker saw he'd interpreted sensibly, he told Joseph, "I dreamed I saw three baskets of white bread on my head. 17The top basket had all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and birds were eating it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Joseph said, "The three baskets represent three days. 19In three days Pharaoh will take off your head and impale you on a pole, and birds will peck away at your body."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Three days later, on his birthday, Pharaoh held a banquet for all his officials. He called up the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 21He gave the cupbearer his office back; he gave the cup to Pharaoh. 22He impaled the baker like Joseph had interpreted, 23but the cupbearer didn't remember to mention Joseph.</span>
