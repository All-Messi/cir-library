## Genesis Chapter 40

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Pharaoh was furious <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and jailed them in the captain of the bodyguard’s house, where Joseph was. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The captain put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them for some time. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The cupbearer and baker both had a dream the same night, each man’s dream with its own meaning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw how dejected they looked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream, <em>“</em><em>I saw</em><em> a vine </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>that had </em><em>three</em><em> branches.</em><em> </em><em>It blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I ha</em><em>d Pharaoh’s cup in my hand.</em><em> I took the grapes and squeezed them into it and gave it to him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Joseph said, <em>“The </em><em>three branches represent</em><em> three days.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>In </em><em>three</em><em> days Pharaoh will </em><em>put you back in</em><em> office</em><em>. Y</em><em>ou’ll hand him the cup like before.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Just ke</em><em>ep me in mind when that happens </em><em>and get me out of this house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I haven’t done anything </em><em>here </em><em>that warranted putting me in </em><em>the </em><em>dungeon.</em><em>” </em><em>	  </em><strong>Gen 40:9-15</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When the chief baker saw he’d interpreted sensibly, he told Joseph, <em>“I dreamed</em><em> </em><em>I saw three</em><em> baskets of white bread on my head.</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>The top basket had all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and birds were eating </em><em>it</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Joseph said, <em>“</em><em>The three baskets represent</em><em> three days.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>In </em><em>three</em><em> days Pharaoh will </em><em>take</em><em> </em><em>off</em><em> your head and </em><em>impale</em><em> you on a </em><em>pole, and birds will peck away at your body</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Three days later, on his birthday, Pharaoh held a banquet for all his officials. He called up the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He gave the cupbearer his office back; he gave the cup to Pharaoh. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He impaled the baker like Joseph had interpreted<em>,</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>but the cupbearer didn’t remember to <em>mention </em>Joseph.</span>
