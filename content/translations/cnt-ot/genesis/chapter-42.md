## Genesis Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jacob found out that Egypt had grain and said to his sons, <em>“Why are you </em><em>just looking</em><em> at one another?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>I’</em><em>ve heard that</em><em> Egypt</em><em> has grain</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Go down and buy some so we can </em><em>stay a</em><em>live.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Ten of Joseph’s brothers went down, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>but Jacob didn’t send Joseph’s full brother Benjamin with them; he was<em> </em>afraid something would happen to him.<em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>His sons went with other people from Canaan because the famine wore on in Canaan too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Joseph governed the country and was the one that sold people <em>the grain</em>. His brothers came and bowed to the ground. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When he recognized them, he disguised himself and was gruff <em>with them</em>, <em>“Where</em><em> are </em><em>you from?”</em> <em>“Canaan;</em><em> </em>we came <em>to buy food.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They didn’t recognize him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He remembered his dreams about them, and said, <em>“</em><em>You’re spies. Y</em><em>ou’</em><em>ve come to look for</em><em> </em><em>weak places in our country</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“No, my lord; we’ve come to buy food. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>We’re honest men, not spies.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“No, you’ve come to look for weak places in our country!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <em>“We’re 12 brothers, sons of one man in Canaan. The youngest is with our father and one has died.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“</em><em>The truth is</em><em>, you’re spies.</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>I’ll check out</em><em> you</em><em>r claims</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>By </em><em>Pharaoh’s</em><em> life, you won’t leave </em><em>here</em><em> unless </em><em>y</em><em>our youngest brother comes!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>O</em><em>ne of you</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>go back to</em><em> get </em><em>him</em><em> while </em><em>the others</em><em> stay here confined so </em><em>I can verify what you claim.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He put them in prison together for three days.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 42:1-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The third day, he said, <em>“Do this and live</em><em>;</em><em> I </em><em>respect</em><em> God:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>if you’re </em><em>telling the truth, </em><em>one of you </em><em>can remain</em><em> in </em><em>custody. T</em><em>he rest </em><em>can take grain for</em><em> your </em><em>households. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Bring your youngest brother, and you won’t die.” </em> That’s what they did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They said to one another, <em>“W</em><em>e’re guilty about our brother</em><em>. W</em><em>e saw </em><em><u>his</u></em><em> distress when he pleaded with us, but we </em><em>didn’t care</em><em>.</em><em> That‘s why</em><em> this distress has come on </em><em><u>us</u></em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Reuben answered, <em>“Didn’t I tell you</em><em> not to</em><em> sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen.</em><em> </em><em>Now comes the reckoning for his blood.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They didn’t know Joseph understood them; there had been a translator between them. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He turned the other way and got tears in his eyes. But when he turned back around and spoke to them, he had Simeon bound right in front of them. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He gave orders to fill their bags with grain, put each man’s money back in his sack, and give them supplies for the return trip.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 42:18-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They loaded their donkeys with grain and left. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>When one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey where they stopped for the night, he saw his money in the top of the sack. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>He told his brothers, <em>“My money’</em><em>s been </em><em>put back in my sack!</em><em>”</em> Their hearts sank, and they <em>turned</em> to one another shaking, <em>“What’</em><em>s God done to us?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When they got to Canaan, they told their father what had happened,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <em>“The lord of the land </em><em>was</em><em> </em><em>gruff with</em><em> us and accused us of being spies.</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>But we told him,</em> <em>‘</em><em>We’re honest men, not spies.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>We’</em><em>re </em><em>12 brothers. One’</em><em>s </em><em>dead</em><em> and the youngest is with our father in Canaan.’</em> <strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>The man said, ‘Here’s </em><em>how I’ll </em><em>find out if</em><em> you’re </em><em>telling the truth</em><em>:</em><em> leave one of your brothers. T</em><em>ake the grain for your household</em><em>s</em><em> and go.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>B</em><em>ring your youngest brother to me so I can </em><em>tell</em><em> you’re not spies.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll </em><em>release </em><em>your brother, and you can </em><em>do business here</em><em>.’”</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 42:26-34</p>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> When they emptied their sacks, every man’s bag of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their money, they were scared. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Jacob said, <em>“</em><em>You’ve deprived me of my children: Joseph’s gone, Simeon’</em><em>s gone, and you </em><em>want to take Benjamin! Everything’s going </em><em>against me</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Reuben told him<em>, “You</em><em> can put my two sons to death if</em><em> I don’t bring him back.</em><em> </em><em>Put him in my care.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> But Jacob said, <em>“</em><em>He’s not</em><em> go</em><em>ing. His brother’</em><em>s dead</em><em>; he’s the only one left. I</em><em>f </em><em>something happens to</em><em> him on the </em><em>trip</em><em>, you’ll </em><em>send</em><em> my gray hair down to Sheol in </em><em>grief</em><em>.”</em><em></span>
