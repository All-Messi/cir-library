## Genesis Chapter 38

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>About that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to visit an Adullamite named Hirah. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He saw the daughter of a Canaanite named Shua<sup>mas</sup>. He married her and slept with her. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>She had a son he named Er, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>another he named Onan, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and one he named Shelah. That happened at Chezib.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Judah took a wife named Tamar for Er his firstborn. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But Er did what the LORD considered sin, so he took Er’s life. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Judah told Onan, <em>“</em><em>Sleep with</em><em> your brother’s w</em><em>ife and perform your duty as a </em><em>brother-in-law to her</em><em>. R</em><em>aise up offspring for your brother.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Onan knew the offspring wouldn’t be his; so when he slept with her, he ejected his semen on the ground so he wouldn’t provide offspring for his brother. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>That displeased the LORD; so he took his life too. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Judah told Tamar, <em>“Remain a widow in your father’s </em><em>family</em><em> till my son Shelah grows up.”</em> (He told<em> himself</em>, <em>“I’m afraid he’ll die like his brothers.”</em>)<em> </em>Tamar went and lived in her father’s family. <strong>Gen 38:1-11</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>After quite a while, Shua’s daughter, Judah’s wife, died. After the time of mourning, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah with his friend Hirah the Adullamite. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Tamar found out that her father-in-law was going there to shear his sheep. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>She took off her widow’s clothes, put on a veil, wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. She’d seen that Shelah had grown up, but <em>Judah</em> hadn’t given her to him as a wife. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a <em>shrine</em> prostitute, because she’d covered her face. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He turned aside to her by the road, and said, <em>“Let me sleep with</em><em> you.”</em> <em>“What will you give me?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite to get back the pledge, he couldn’t find her. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He asked the men there, <em>“Where’</em><em>s the </em>shrine <em>prostitute that was by the road at Enaim?” </em> <em>“There hasn’t been a</em><em>ny</em><em> </em>shrine<em> prostitute here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So he went back, <em>“I could</em><em>n’t find her.</em><em> </em>The men said<em> </em>there hasn’t been any <em>shrine</em> prostitute there. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Judah said, <em>“Let her keep them so </em><em>they don’t ridicule us</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I did send this kid, but you couldn’t find her.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Gen 38:20-23</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>About three months later, Judah was informed, <em>“Your daughter-in-law T</em><em>amar has served as a </em>shrine<em> prostitute and got</em><em> pregnant.”</em><em> </em> Judah said, <em>“Bring her out and </em><em>burn her</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> While she was being brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, <em>“I’m pregnant by the man that owns these </em><em>things. See</em><em> whose signet ring, cords, and staff </em><em>they are.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Judah recognized them, <em>“She’s </em><em>better</em><em> than I am</em><em>,</em><em> because I didn’t give her to my son Shelah.”</em> He never slept with her again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When it was time for her to deliver, she was carrying twins. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>As she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife tied a red <em>thread</em> on it, <em>“This one came out first.”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>But he pulled his hand back and his brother came out. <em>The midwife</em> said, <em>“</em><em>What a </em><em>‘</em><em>breach</em><em>’</em><em> you’ve made for yourself”</em>; so he was named Perez. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Afterward his brother was born with the “red” <em>thread</em> on his hand. He was named Zerah.</span>
