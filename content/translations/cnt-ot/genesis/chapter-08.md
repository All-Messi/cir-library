## Genesis Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>God remembered Noah and the animals in the ark. He made wind blow over the whole world, and the water started to recede. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The fountains in the deep and the floodgates in the sky closed, and the rain stopped. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The water receded steadily for <strong>150 days</strong>. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>On <strong>the seventeenth</strong> <strong>day, seventh month</strong>, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The water kept going down till <strong>the tenth month</strong>. <strong>The first day, tenth month</strong>, mountains became visible.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>After <strong>40 days</strong> Noah opened the window of the ark, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and sent out a raven that flew around till the water dried up. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then he sent out a pigeon to see if the water had gone down, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>but it didn’t find anywhere to land and came back. The water was still covering the ground. Noah held out his hand and brought <em>the pigeon</em> into the ark. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>After <strong>a week</strong> he sent it out again. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>It came back toward evening with a new olive leaf in its beak; so Noah knew the water had gone down. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Another <strong>week</strong> later he sent it out again, and it didn’t come back. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><strong><sup>-14</sup></strong>On the <strong>first day, first month</strong><strong>, 601</strong><strong><sup>st</sup></strong><strong> year,</strong> the water had dried up. <strong>The twenty-seventh day, second month</strong> Noah took the roof off the ark and saw that the ground was dry. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>God told him <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>to leave<sup>pl</sup> the ark <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>and take the animals out so they could reproduce and multiply<em>.</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Noah’s family went out, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and the animals left the ark after their kind.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Life After the Flood


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Noah built an altar to the LORD, took <em>one </em>from every <em>ceremonially</em> clean animal and bird, and offered burnt offerings on it. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said to himself, <em>“I’ll never curse the ground again because of </em><em>people’s evil motives from their</em><em> youth up.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll never destroy every living thing again.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>As long as the </em><em>world</em><em> </em><em>remains</em><em>, </em><em>there will be sowing </em><em>time and harvest, heat and cold, summer and winter, day and night.”</em></span>
