## Genesis Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Sarai, Abram’s wife, hadn’t had any children. She had an Egyptian maid named Hagar. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Sarai told Abram, “<em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has kept me from having children.</em> <em>Sleep with</em><em> my </em><em>maid. M</em><em>aybe I can </em><em>have</em><em> children through her.”</em> Abram took her advice. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>That happened after Abram had lived in Canaan</span>
<p class="section-ref">for 10</p>

### years. 4He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she saw she was pregnant, she started disrespecting her mistress. 5Sarai told Abram,  “You’re responsible for the way she’s acting toward me. I gave you my servant; but when she saw she was pregnant, she started disrespecting me. The LORD decide between you and me.”


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Abram said, <em>“</em><em>She’s under</em><em> your </em><em>authority. Deal with</em><em> her </em><em>as you see fit</em><em>.”</em> Sarai was so rough on her that she ran away.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 16:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The angel of the LORD found her by a spring in the desert on the way to Shur. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Hagar, Sarai’s </em><em>servant, where have you come from?</em><em> </em><em>W</em><em>here are you going?”</em> <em>“I’m gett</em><em>ing </em><em>away </em><em>from my mistress.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The angel told her, <em>“</em><em>Go back</em><em> and submit to her.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I’ll multiply your descendants </em><em>till</em><em> they’ll be too many to count.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> </em><em>have a son.</em><em> </em><em>Call him </em><em>Ishmael</em><em> because </em><em>‘the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has </em><em>listened’ to</em><em> your plight.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>He’ll be </em><em>like </em><em>a wild </em><em>donkey, opposed to everybody</em><em> and </em><em>by everybody</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>He’ll live </em><em>east of</em><em> </em><em>h</em><em>is </em><em>relatives</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>She called the LORD Elroi because she said, <em>“</em><em>I’m </em>still <em>alive after ‘</em><em>I saw him</em><em>.’”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So the well was called Beer-lahai-roi between Kadesh and Bered. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Hagar gave Abram a son he named Ishmael. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 86</p>
