## Genesis Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the beginning God created earth and sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Earth was unformed and empty, and open water lay in the darkness. God’s Spirit was moving over the ocean. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>God said, <em>“Let there be light,”</em> and there was light. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He saw the light was good and separated it from darkness. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He called light “day” and darkness<em> </em>“night.” Morning and evening made day one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>God said, <em>“Let </em><em>an expanse separate</em><em> the water </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>below it from </em><em>the water </em><em>above it.”</em> It happened. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He called the expanse “sky.” Morning and evening made day two.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>God said, <em>“Let the water below the sky </em><em>gather in</em><em> one place</em><em> and dr</em><em>y land appear.”</em> It happened. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He called the dry part “land” and called the water “ocean.” He saw it was good. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Let the land sprout vegetation—plants with seeds and t</em><em>rees that bear fruit with seeds after their</em><em> kind.”</em> It happened. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The land sprouted vegetation—plants with seeds like themselves and trees that bore fruit with seeds in them. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He saw it was good. Morning and evening made day three.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 1:1-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>God said, <em>“Let there be lights in the sky to separate day </em><em>from night and to mark</em><em> days, </em><em>years, and </em><em>seasons.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Let them shine on the earth.”</em> It happened. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He made two big lights, the bigger one to govern the day and the smaller one to govern the night. He made the stars too. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>God put them in the sky to shine on the earth, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>to separate light from darkness, and to preside over day and night. He saw it was good. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Morning and evening made day four.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>God said, <em>“Let the water teem with animals</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em>let </em><em>birds fly in the sky above the land.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He created large ocean animals and every animal that moves in the water after their kind and the birds that fly after their kind. He saw it was good. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He blessed them, <em>“Reproduce and fill the water in the oceans</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em>let birds </em><em>multiply on the </em><em>land</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Morning and evening made day five.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 1:14-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>God said, <em>“Let the </em><em>ground</em><em> produce animals that reproduce after their kind:</em><em> cattle</em><em>, </em><em>small animals</em><em>, living things.”</em><em> </em>It happened. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He made living things from the ground after their kind, cattle after their kind, and every small animal that moves around on the ground after its kind. He saw it was good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>God said, <em>“Let’s make </em><em>people</em><em> in our image</em><em>—like us</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Let</em><em>’s make</em><em> </em><em>them</em><em> responsib</em><em>le</em><em> for the fish, the birds, the cat</em><em>tle, the </em><em>earth, and everything</em><em> that moves around </em><em>on </em><em>the ground</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>So he created people in his own image, created them male and female, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>and blessed them, <em>“Reproduce,</em><em> </em><em>populate</em><em> the earth</em><em>,</em><em> and preside over it.</em><em> </em><em>Be responsible for the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, and the animals on the </em><em>ground</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29-30</sup></strong><em>Green plants that yield</em><em> seed</em><em> and trees that bear fruit </em><em>I’ve given you and the animals for food.”</em> It happened. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He saw that everything he’d made was very good. Morning and evening made day six.</span>
