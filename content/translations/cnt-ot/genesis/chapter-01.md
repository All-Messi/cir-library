## Genesis Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the beginning God created earth and sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Earth was unformed and empty, and open water lay in the darkness. God's Spirit was moving over the ocean. 3God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 4He saw the light was good and separated it from darkness. 5He called light "day" and darkness "night." Morning and evening made day one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> God said, "Let an expanse separate the water 7below it from the water above it." It happened. 8He called the expanse "sky." Morning and evening made day two.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> God said, "Let the water below the sky gather in one place and dry land appear." It happened. 10He called the dry part "land" and called the water "ocean." He saw it was good. 11He said, "Let the land sprout vegetation—plants with seeds and trees that bear fruit with seeds after their kind." It happened. 12The land sprouted vegetation—plants with seeds like themselves and trees that bore fruit with seeds in them. 13He saw it was good. Morning and evening made day three.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night and to mark days, years, and seasons. 15Let them shine on the earth." It happened. 16He made two big lights, the bigger one to govern the day and the smaller one to govern the night. He made the stars too. 17God put them in the sky to shine on the earth, 18to separate light from darkness, and to preside over day and night. He saw it was good. 19Morning and evening made day four.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> God said, "Let the water teem with animals, and let birds fly in the sky above the land." 21He created large ocean animals and every animal that moves in the water after their kind and the birds that fly after their kind. He saw it was good. 22He blessed them, "Reproduce and fill the water in the oceans, and let birds multiply on the land." 23Morning and evening made day five.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> God said, "Let the ground produce animals that reproduce after their kind: cattle, small animals, living things." It happened. 25He made living things from the ground after their kind, cattle after their kind, and every small animal that moves around on the ground after its kind. He saw it was good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> God said, "Let's make people in our image—like us. Let's make them responsible for the fish, the birds, the cattle, the earth, and everything that moves around on the ground."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So he created people in his own image, created them male and female, 28and blessed them, "Reproduce, populate the earth, and preside over it. Be responsible for the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, and the animals on the ground. 29-30Green plants that yield seed and trees that bear fruit I've given you and the animals for food." It happened. 31He saw that everything he'd made was very good. Morning and evening made day six.</span>
