### , he was pasturing the flock with his half-brothers, including the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. He brought his father a bad report about what they were doing. 3Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons because he was born when Israel was old. He made him a tunic with many colors in it. 4His brothers saw that their father loved him more than them, so they despised him and wouldn’t speak to him in a civil way.


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they despised him more, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Let me tell you a dream I</em><em> had.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>We were ty</em><em>ing </em><em>up </em><em>bundles in the field</em><em>. M</em><em>y </em><em>bundle</em><em> stood up straight and yours gathered around and bowed to mine.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>His brothers asked, <em>“Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’re</em><em> </em><em>think you’re going to reign over us? Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’re</em><em> going to rule us?”</em> They hated him even more for his dreams and what he said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He told his brothers another dream he had, <em>“The sun, moon, and </em><em>11</em><em> stars were bowing down to me.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He told his father too, who scolded him, <em>“</em><em>What’s a</em><em> dream</em><em> like that mean</em><em>?</em><em> Are</em><em> your brothers</em><em>, </em><em>your mother, </em><em>and I</em><em> </em><em>really</em><em> </em><em>going to </em><em>bow </em><em>to</em><em> you?”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>His brothers resented him, but his father wondered what it might mean<em>.  </em><em>	  </em></span>

### Joseph Sold by His Brothers


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>His brothers went to pasture their father’s flock at Shechem. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Israel told Joseph, <em>“</em><em>Y</em><em>our brothers </em><em>are </em><em>pasturing </em><em>at</em><em> Shechem?</em><em> Go join</em><em> them.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He told him to bring him word how they and the flock were doing<em>.</em><em> </em>He sent him from the Valley of Hebron to Shechem. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>A fellow found him walking in the countryside and asked him, <em>“What are you looking for?”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“My brothers. Where are they</em><em> pasturing</em><em> </em>the flock<em>?</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“They’ve moved on from here.</em><em> </em><em>I heard them say</em><em> they were going to Dothan.</em><em>”</em><em> </em> Joseph trailed them to Dothan.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 37:12-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When they saw him in the distance, they said, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Here comes the</em><em> dreamer!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>L</em><em>et’s kill him</em><em> and throw him into one of the cistern</em><em>s.</em><em> </em><em>We</em><em> can</em><em> say</em><em> a</em><em> wild animal </em><em>ate</em><em> him.</em><em> </em><em>Then let’s see what comes of his dreams!”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>But Reuben heard about their scheme and came to his rescue, <em>“Let’s not kill him. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Don’t shed blood.</em><em> Throw him into this cistern</em><em> in the </em><em>open country</em><em>, but don’t lay hands on him</em><em>.” </em>He intended to rescue him and get him back to his father. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When Joseph got to his brothers, they stripped off his multi-colored robe <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and put him in an empty cistern.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>They sat down to eat. When they looked up, a caravan of Ishmaelite <em>traders</em> was coming from Gilead with camels carrying aromatic gum, salve, and myrrh—headed for Egypt. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Judah said to his brothers, <em>“What</em><em>’s in it for us if we</em><em> kill our brother and c</em><em>over up h</em><em>is blood?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Let’s sell </em><em>him to the Ishmaelite</em><em>s, not hurt him. He’</em><em>s our brother, our own flesh.”</em> They agreed. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Then some of the Midianite traders (Ishmaelites) went by; they pulled him out of the cistern and sold him to them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Reuben went back to the cistern, and Joseph wasn’t in it. He tore his clothes! <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He went to his brothers, <em>“The boy’s not there.</em><em> </em><em>What am I </em><em>going</em><em> to do?”</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>They took Joseph’s tunic and slaughtered a male goat. They dipped the robe in its blood <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>and took it to their father, <em>“We found this.</em><em> S</em><em>ee if it’s your son’s </em><em>robe</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He examined it, <em>“It’s </em><em>his</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>A </em><em>wild animal has torn him to pieces and eaten him</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>Jacob tore his clothes and put burlap around his waist and mourned for him many days. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>His sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, <em>“I’ll go down to Sheol mourning for </em><em>him</em><em>.”</em> His father cried over him. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the bodyguard.</span>
