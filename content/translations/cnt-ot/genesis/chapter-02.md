## Genesis Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The seventh day God had finished creating the earth and sky and everything in them, and he rested from his work. 3He blessed the seventh day and set it aside because he'd finished working that day.     	     Gen 1:24-2:3</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> This is what the LORD God did when he created the earth and sky. 5Shrubs and plants hadn't sprouted yet, because he hadn't made it rain and there wasn't anybody to cultivate the ground. 6A mist was coming up from the ground to water it. 7Then he formed a man out of the "ground," breathed into him, and made him alive. The man became a living, breathing being.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The LORD God planted an orchard in the East in Eden and put the man there. 9From the ground he made trees grow that looked nice and were good for producing food. In the orchard he planted the tree of life and the tree for knowing good and bad. 10A river flowed out of Eden to water the orchard. Then it separated into four rivers: 11-12the Pishon, that flows around the land of Havilah, where there's fine gold, bdellium, and onyx; 13the Gihon, that flows around Cush; 14the Tigris, that flows east of Assyria; and the Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD God put the man in the orchard to trim it and take care of it. 16He told him, "You're free to eat the fruit from any tree in the orchard 17except the one that gives the knowledge of good and bad. If you eat its fruit, you'll die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The LORD God said, "It's not good for the man to be by himself. I'll make him a helper that corresponds to him." 19Out of the ground he'd formed every land animal and bird. He brought them to the man to see what he'd call them. Whatever he called them became their name. 20He named the cattle, birds, and wild animals; but he didn't find a helper that corresponded to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So the LORD God put him into a deep sleep, took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in place of it. 22He formed a woman from the rib and brought her to him. 23The man said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> That's why a man is to leave his parents and unite with his wife, and they'll become one physical identity. 25The man and his wife were both naked, but they weren't self-conscious.</span>
