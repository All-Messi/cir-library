## Genesis Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The seventh day God had finished creating the earth and sky and everything in them, and he rested from his work. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He blessed the seventh day and set it aside because he’d finished working that day.</span>

### :3 The Creation of Mankind


<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>This is what the LORD God did when he created the earth and sky. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Shrubs and plants hadn’t sprouted yet, because he hadn’t made it rain and there wasn’t anybody to cultivate the ground. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A mist was coming up from the ground to water it. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then he formed a man out of the “ground,” breathed into him, and made him alive. The man became a living, breathing being.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The LORD God planted an orchard in the East in Eden and put the man there. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>From the ground he made trees grow that looked nice and were good for producing food. In the orchard <em>he planted</em> the tree of life and the tree for knowing good and bad. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>A river flowed out of Eden to water the orchard. Then it separated into four rivers: <strong><sup>11-</sup></strong><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>the<strong> </strong>Pishon, that flows around the land of Havilah, where there’s fine gold, bdellium, and onyx; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>the Gihon, that flows around Cush; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>the Tigris, that flows east of Assyria; and the Euphrates.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 2:4-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The LORD God put the man in the orchard to trim it and take care of it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He told him, <em>“You</em><em>’re free to</em><em> eat</em><em> </em>the fruit<em> from any tree in the </em><em>orchard </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>except the on</em><em>e that gives the knowledge of good and bad.</em><em> If</em><em> you eat its fruit</em><em>, you’ll </em><em>die.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The LORD God said<em>, “It’s not go</em><em>od for the man to be by himself.</em><em> I’ll make him a helper </em><em>that</em><em> correspond</em><em>s</em><em> to him.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Out of the ground he’d formed every land animal and bird. He brought <em>them</em> to the man to see what he’d call them. Whatever he called them became their name. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He named the cattle, birds, and wild animals; but he didn’t find a helper that corresponded to him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 2:15-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So the LORD God put him into a deep sleep, took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in place of it. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He formed a woman from the rib and brought her to him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The man said, <em>“This is bone from my bones</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	flesh from my flesh.</em> <em>	</em><em>	She’ll be called ‘</em><em>woman</em><em>,’</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because she was taken out of </em><em>‘</em><em>man.</em><em>’</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>That’s why a man is to leave his parents and unite with his wife, and they’ll become one physical identity. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The man and his wife were both naked, but they weren’t self-conscious.</span>
