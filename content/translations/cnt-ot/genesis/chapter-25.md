<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Isaac was 40 when he married Rebekah. 21He prayed for her because she wasn't having children. The LORD answered him, and she became pregnant, 22but the children struggled with each other inside her. She said, "Why am I this way?" She went to ask the LORD. 23He said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When it came time to deliver, she had twins. 25The first was born red all over like a "hairy" piece of clothes. They named him Esau. 26His brother was born "holding" onto Esau's "heel"; so they named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 when she had them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, an outdoorsman. Jacob stayed around home, living in tents. 28Isaac liked Esau because he had a taste for game; Rebekah liked Jacob. 29One day when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the countryside famished. 30He told Jacob, "Let me have some of that 'red' stew. I'm starving." (So he was called Edom.) 33"Swear to me first;" so he swore to him and gave him his birthright. 34Then Jacob gave him bread and lentil stew. He ate it, got up, and left.</span>
