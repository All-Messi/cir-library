## Genesis Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he told his palace overseer, <em>“Fill </em><em>their sacks with as much as they can transport. Put each man’s money in his sack, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>and p</em><em>ut my silver cup </em><em>with the</em><em> money in the </em><em>top</em><em> of the youngest man’s sack.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> At daylight they sent them away with their donkeys. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’d just got out of the city when Joseph told his palace overseer, <em>“</em><em>F</em><em>ollow </em><em>them</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>When you catch up with them, say, </em><em>‘</em><em>Wh</em><em>y repay good with bad</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Isn’t this what my lord drinks </em><em>out of</em><em> </em><em>and uses for fortunetelling? You’</em><em>ve done wrong.</em><em>’” </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He caught up with them and told them that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They hurried and lowered their sacks to the ground and opened them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He searched from the oldest to the youngest and found the cup in Benjamin’s sack. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They tore their clothes and loaded their donkeys and went back to the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When Judah and his brothers got to Joseph’s house, he was still there. They prostrated themselves on the floor. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He asked, <em>“</em><em>What’ve you</em><em> done?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t you know a man like me can </em><em>tell</em><em> </em><em>fortunes</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Judah said, <em>“What can we say?</em><em> </em><em>How can we </em><em>explain this? God has found out our</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>in</em><em>. We’re your slaves</em><em>, we and the one he found the cup with.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He said, <em>“I wouldn’t do </em><em>that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The one the cup was </em><em>with</em><em> will be my slave</em><em>. T</em><em>he rest of you can go up to your father in peace.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Gen 44:14-17</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Judah came up to him and said, <em>“</em><em>M</em><em>ay</em><em> I </em><em>say something to you?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t be mad</em><em>;</em><em> you’re equal to Pharaoh.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>You </em><em>asked </em><em>us if we had a father or brother. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>We </em><em>told you we </em><em>ha</em><em>d</em><em> an </em><em>elderly</em><em> father and a </em><em>young</em><em> </em>brother<em> that was</em><em> born when </em>our father<em> was ol</em><em>d. He’</em><em>s the only one left from his mo</em><em>ther, and his father loves him (a full brother of his is dead).” </em></span>
