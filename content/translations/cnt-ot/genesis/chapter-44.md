## Genesis Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he told his palace overseer, "Fill their sacks with as much as they can transport. Put each man's money in his sack, 2and put my silver cup with the money in the top of the youngest man's sack."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> At daylight they sent them away with their donkeys. 4They'd just got out of the city when Joseph told his palace overseer, "Follow them. When you catch up with them, say, 'Why repay good with bad? 5Isn't this what my lord drinks out of and uses for fortunetelling? You've done wrong.'" 6He caught up with them and told them that. 7"Why say something like that? We wouldn't do that. 8We brought back the money we found in our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your lord's house? 9Kill whoever you find it with, and we'll be your slaves." 10"All right. The one that has it will be my slave. The rest of you will go free."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They hurried and lowered their sacks to the ground and opened them. 12He searched from the oldest to the youngest and found the cup in Benjamin's sack. 13They tore their clothes and loaded their donkeys and went back to the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When Judah and his brothers got to Joseph's house, he was still there. They prostrated themselves on the floor. 15He asked, "What've you done? Don't you know a man like me can tell fortunes?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Judah said, "What can we say? How can we explain this? God has found out our sin. We're your slaves, we and the one he found the cup with."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He said, "I wouldn't do that. The one the cup was with will be my slave. The rest of you can go up to your father in peace."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Judah came up to him and said, "May I say something to you? Don't be mad; you're equal to Pharaoh. 19You asked us if we had a father or brother. 20We told you we had an elderly father and a young brother that was born when our father was old. He's the only one left from his mother, and his father loves him (a full brother of his is dead)." 26"But we said, 'We can't. If our youngest brother's not with us, we won't be able to see the man.' 27"You know my wife had two sons. 28One of them went out and must have been torn to pieces by wild animals. I haven't seen him since. 29If you take this one and something happens to him, you'll send my gray hair down to Sheol in grief." 30-31"If I go back and he sees the boy's not with us, he'll die. His life is wrapped up in the boy's life. We'll send his gray hair down to Sheol in grief. 32I became a guarantee for the boy, I said I'd bear the blame permanently if I didn't bring him back. 33Let me stay in his place so he can go with his half-brothers. 34How could I go up to my father if he's not with me? I'd see how hard it would be on him."</span>
