## Genesis Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God blessed Noah and his sons, "Reproduce and repopulate the world. 2Animals and birds will be afraid of you. I've made you responsible for what moves on the ground and for the fish in the ocean. 3You can eat anything that lives and moves as well as the green plants, 4but don't eat the blood with the meat. 5I'll demand your life from every animal and everyone 6that sheds someone's blood. They will have their blood shed because I made people in my image. 7Reproduce and repopulate the world abundantly."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> God told Noah and his sons, 9"I'm establishing a covenant with you, your descendants, 10and the living things that left the ark: 11I'll never again get rid of people and animals and destroy the world with a flood. 12-13My rainbow in the clouds represents that covenant for all generations: 14when I bring clouds over the earth, the rainbow 15will remind me of my covenant." [16-17]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Noah's sons that came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; Ham was Canaan's father. 19Noah's sons began to repopulate the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Noah began to cultivate the ground and planted a vineyard. 21He drank the wine and got drunk and uncovered himself in his tent. 22Ham saw him naked and told his brothers outside. 23Shem and Japheth held a cloak over their shoulders, walked backwards, and looked away so they wouldn't see him naked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When Noah woke up from his wine, he found out what his youngest son had done. 25He said, "Accursed be Canaan. He'll be the lowest of servants to his brothers. 26Bless the LORD, Shem's God. Canaan will serve Shem. 27May God give Japheth an extensive inheritance. He'll live in Shem's tents, and Canaan will serve him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 29Altogether he lived 950 years and died.</span>
