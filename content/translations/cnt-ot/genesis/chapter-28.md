## Genesis Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and charged him, "Don't marry a Canaanite. 2Go to Paddan-aram, to Bethuel your mother's father, and choose a wife from Laban your uncle. 3May God Almighty [El-Shaddai] bless you and make you numerous so you'll become a group of nations. 4May he give you and your descendants Abraham's blessing so you'll receive the land where you've lived as a nomad, the land God gave Abraham."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Esau saw that Isaac had blessed him, sent him to Paddan-aram to find a wife, and charged him not to marry a Canaanite. 7He saw that Jacob had obeyed his parents 8and that Isaac didn't like Canaanite women. 9So he went to Ishmael and—besides the wives he had—married Ishmael's daughter Mahalath/Bashemath, sister of Nebaioth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. 11After sundown he stopped for the night and lay down with a stone under his head. 12He dreamed that a ladder was set up on the earth with its top in the sky. God's angels were climbing up and down on it. 13The LORD stood at the top of it and said, "I'm the LORD God of Abraham and your father Isaac. I'll give you and your descendants the ground you're lying on. 14They'll be like the dust on the ground and spread out in every direction. In you and your descendants, I will bless all the families in the world. 15I'll protect you wherever you go, and bring you back here. I won't leave you till I've done what I've promised."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jacob woke up and said, "The LORD is certainly here, and I didn't know it." 17He was afraid, "This place is awesome! It's nothing but 'God's house' and heaven's door."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He got up early and took the stone that was under his head, set it up as a marker, and poured olive oil on it. 19He called the place Bethel (named Luz before) 20and vowed, "If God protects me on this trip, gives me food and clothes, 21and brings me back to my father's family safely, then the LORD will be my God. 22This stone will be 'God's house,' and I'll give him a tenth of what he gives me."</span>
