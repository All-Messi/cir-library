## Genesis Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Abraham moved toward the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur, living for a while in Gerar. 2He said of Sarah, "She's my sister"; so Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took her. 3But God came to him in a dream at night, "You're a dead man. The woman you've taken is married."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Abimelech hadn't come near her, and he said, "Lord, will you kill a blameless nation? 5Didn't he say she was his sister, and she say he was her brother? I've done this in integrity and innocence."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> God said to him in the dream, "I know. I've kept you from sinning against me and didn't let you touch her. 7Give the man his wife. He's a prophet; he'll pray for you, and you'll live. If you don't, you can be sure you and everybody you have will die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Abimelech got up early and called his officials and told them. They were really afraid. 9He called Abraham, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you that you brought a serious sin on me and my kingdom? That shouldn't be done. 10What made you do it?" 11"I thought, there's no respect for God here. They'll kill me for my wife. 12Besides, she really is my sister, my father's daughter, but not my mother's. 13When God had me wander from my father's family, I told her to show me kindness wherever we went by saying I was her brother."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, cattle, male and female servants, and gave Sarah back to him. 15He said, "My land is open to you. Settle anywhere you like." 16He told Sarah, "I've given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver to exonerate you to everybody with you and anywhere else.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Abraham prayed and God restored Abimelech, his wife, and maids so they could have children again. 18The LORD had closed the wombs in his household because of Sarah.</span>
