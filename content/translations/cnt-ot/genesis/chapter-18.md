## Genesis Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD appeared to <em>Abraham </em>by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre while he was sitting at the<em> </em>entrance to his tent during the heat of the day. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He looked up and saw three men standing a little way off. He ran to meet them and bowed to the ground, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Sir, if you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> please, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>l</em><em>et</em><em> me bring</em><em> </em><em>some</em><em> water</em><em> so you can wash your feet</em><em> and rest under the tree.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I’ll bring a loaf of bread so you can refresh yourselves. Then you can go on.”</em> <em>“</em><em>All right</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Abraham hurried to Sarah in the tent, “<em>Quick! Get three</em><em> measures of fine flour ready, knead </em>it<em>, and make bread cakes.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He ran to the herd and took a choice, tender calf, and gave <em>it</em> to a servant to fix quickly. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He took yogurt, milk, and the veal he’d fixed and set <em>it </em>in front of them. He stood there under the tree while they ate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Then they asked, <em>“Where’s Sarah?”</em> <em>“In the tent.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>He said, <em>“I’ll </em><em>come back next year at this time, and Sarah will have a son.”</em><em> </em>She was listening at the entrance to the tent behind him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Abraham and Sarah were getting old. She was too old to have children<em>. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Sarah laughed to herself,<em> </em><em>“</em><em>At this age</em><em>, </em><em>am</em><em> I </em><em>really going to </em><em>have </em>that <em>delight?</em><em> </em><em>My </em><em>husband [lord]</em><em> is old too</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The LORD asked Abraham, <em>“Why did Sarah laugh and say, </em><em>‘Will I really have a child when I’</em><em>m so old?’ </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Is there anything I can’t do? Like I said, at this time next year Sarah will have a son.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Sarah denied<em> it</em>, <em>“I didn’t laugh</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> (She was afraid.) <em>“</em><em>Oh y</em><em>es, you did.”</em><em>     </em><em>	 </em></span>

### Abraham Intercedes for Sodom


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>The men got up and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham was walking with them to see them off. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The LORD said, <em>“Should I </em><em>keep</em><em> from Abraham what I’m about to do?</em><em> </em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>He’ll certainly become a </em><em>large,</em><em> </em><em>strong</em><em> nation, and </em><em>bless every nation</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I’ve chosen him to command his children an</em><em>d household after him to keep my</em><em> way by doing </em><em>what’s good and just, so I</em><em> can bring on him what </em><em>I’ve</em><em> </em><em>promised</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He told<em> Abraham</em>, <em>“</em><em>The outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah is extreme. T</em><em>heir sin is awful.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I’m g</em><em>o</em><em>ing</em><em> down </em><em>to</em><em> see if they’</em><em>re </em><em>as bad as their outcry.</em><em> </em><em>If not, I’ll know.”</em>	<em> </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 18:16-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The other men turned and started toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing in front of the LORD. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Abraham came and said, <em>“Will you sweep away the </em><em>good</em><em> with the </em><em>bad</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Supposing there</span>
<p class="section-ref">are 50</p>

### good people in the city; won’t you spare it for their sake? 25Surely you wouldn’t kill the good with the bad and treat them alike! Surely not! Won’t the Judge of the whole world do what’s right?”


<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The LORD said, <em>“If I</span>
<p class="section-ref">find 50</p>

### good people in Sodom, I’ll spare the whole place.”	 	Gen 18:22-26


<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Abraham answered<em>, “I’ve dared to speak to </em><em>you</em><em> though I’m </em><em>only</em><em> dust and ashes,</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>Supp</em><em>ose there</span>
<p class="section-ref">are 45</p>

### , will you destroy the whole city because of 5?” “I won’t destroy it if I find 45.” 	29“Suppose there are 40?” 	“I won’t do it for the 40.” 	30“Lord, don’t be angry. I’ll ask again: suppose you find 30 there?” 	“I won’t do it if I find 30 there.” 	31“I’ve dared to speak to the Lord; suppose there are 20?” 	“I won’t destroy it for the 20.” 	32“Lord, don’t be angry, and I’ll speak just one more time. Suppose there are 10?” 	“I won’t destroy it for the 10.”


<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>As soon as he’d finished talking to Abraham, he left, and Abraham went back.<strong> </strong></span>
