## Genesis Chapter 18

### The Birth of Isaac Promised

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD appeared to <em>Abraham </em>by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre while he was sitting at the<em> </em>entrance to his tent during the heat of the day. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He looked up and saw three men standing a little way off. He ran to meet them and bowed to the ground,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <em>“Sir, if you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> please, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>l</em><em>et</em><em> me bring</em><em> </em><em>some</em><em> water</em><em> so you can wash your feet</em><em> and rest under the tree.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I’ll bring a loaf of bread so you can refresh yourselves. Then you can go on.”</em> <em>“</em><em>All right</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Abraham hurried to Sarah in the tent, “<em>Quick! Get three</em><em> measures of fine flour ready, knead </em>it<em>, and make bread cakes.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He ran to the herd and took a choice, tender calf, and gave <em>it</em> to a servant to fix quickly. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He took yogurt, milk, and the veal he’d fixed and set <em>it </em>in front of them. He stood there under the tree while they ate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then they asked, <em>“Where’s Sarah?”</em> <em>“In the tent.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He said, <em>“I’ll </em><em>come back next year at this time, and Sarah will have a son.”</em><em> </em>She was listening at the entrance to the tent behind him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Abraham and Sarah were getting old. She was too old to have children<em>. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Sarah laughed to herself,<em> </em><em>“</em><em>At this age</em><em>, </em><em>am</em><em> I </em><em>really going to </em><em>have </em>that <em>delight?</em><em> </em><em>My </em><em>husband [lord]</em><em> is old too</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD asked Abraham, <em>“Why did Sarah laugh and say, </em><em>‘Will I really have a child when I’</em><em>m so old?’ </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Is there anything I can’t do? Like I said, at this time next year Sarah will have a son.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Sarah denied<em> it</em>, <em>“I didn’t laugh</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> (She was afraid.) <em>“</em><em>Oh y</em><em>es, you did.”</em><em></span>

### Abraham Intercedes for Sodom


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The men got up and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham was walking with them to see them off. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The LORD said, <em>“Should I </em><em>keep</em><em> from Abraham what I’m about to do?</em><em> </em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>He’ll certainly become a </em><em>large,</em><em> </em><em>strong</em><em> nation, and </em><em>bless every nation</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I’ve chosen him to command his children an</em><em>d household after him to keep my</em><em> way by doing </em><em>what’s good and just, so I</em><em> can bring on him what </em><em>I’ve</em><em> </em><em>promised</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He told<em> Abraham</em>, <em>“</em><em>The outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah is extreme. T</em><em>heir sin is awful.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I’m g</em><em>o</em><em>ing</em><em> down </em><em>to</em><em> see if they’</em><em>re </em><em>as bad as their outcry.</em><em> </em><em>If not, I’ll know.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 18:16-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The other men turned and started toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing in front of the LORD. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Abraham came and said, <em>“Will you sweep away the </em><em>good</em><em> with the </em><em>bad</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Supposing there are 50 good </em>people<em> in the city; won’t you spare it for their sake? </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Surely you wouldn’t kill the good with the bad and treat them alike! Surely not! Won’t the Judge of the whole world do what’s right?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The LORD said, <em>“If I find 50 good people in Sodom, I’ll spare the whole place.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 18:22-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abraham answered<em>, “I’ve dared to speak to </em><em>you</em><em> though I’m </em><em>only</em><em> dust and ashes,</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>Supp</em><em>ose there are 45, will</em><em> you destroy the whole city because of </em><em>5</em><em>?”</em> <em>“I won’t destroy </em>it<em> if I find </em><em>45</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“Suppose there are 40?”</em> <em>	“I won’t do it for the 40.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <em>“</em><em>Lor</em><em>d, don’t be angry.</em><em> I’ll ask again:</em><em> </em><em>suppose you find </em><em>30</em><em> there?”</em> <em>	“I won’t do it if I find 30 there.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> <em>“I’ve dared to speak to the Lord; suppose there are 20?”</em> <em>	“I won’t destroy it for the 20.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> <em>“Lord, don’t be angry, and I’ll speak just one more time. Suppose there are 10?”</em> <em>	“I won’t destroy </em><em>it</em><em> for the 10.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As soon as he’d finished talking to Abraham, he left, and Abraham went back.<strong></span>
