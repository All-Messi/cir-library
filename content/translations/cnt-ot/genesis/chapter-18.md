## Genesis Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD appeared to Abraham by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the heat of the day. 2He looked up and saw three men standing a little way off. He ran to meet them and bowed to the ground, 3"Sir, if yousg please, 4let me bring some water so you can wash your feet and rest under the tree. 5I'll bring a loaf of bread so you can refresh yourselves. Then you can go on."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Abraham hurried to Sarah in the tent, "Quick! Get three measures of fine flour ready, knead it, and make bread cakes." 7He ran to the herd and took a choice, tender calf, and gave it to a servant to fix quickly. 8He took yogurt, milk, and the veal he'd fixed and set it in front of them. He stood there under the tree while they ate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then they asked, "Where's Sarah?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He said, "I'll come back next year at this time, and Sarah will have a son." She was listening at the entrance to the tent behind him. 11Abraham and Sarah were getting old. She was too old to have children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Sarah laughed to herself, "At this age, am I really going to have that delight? My husband [lord] is old too."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD asked Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child when I'm so old?' 14Is there anything I can't do? Like I said, at this time next year Sarah will have a son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Sarah denied it, "I didn't laugh." (She was afraid.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The men got up and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham was walking with them to see them off. 17The LORD said, "Should I keep from Abraham what I'm about to do?  18He'll certainly become a large, strong nation, and bless every nation. 19I've chosen him to command his children and household after him to keep my way by doing what's good and just, so I can bring on him what I've promised."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He told Abraham, "The outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah is extreme. Their sin is awful. 21I'm going down to see if they're as bad as their outcry. If not, I'll know."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The other men turned and started toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing in front of the LORD. 23Abraham came and said, "Will you sweep away the good with the bad? 24Supposing there are 50 good people in the city; won't you spare it for their sake? 25Surely you wouldn't kill the good with the bad and treat them alike! Surely not! Won't the Judge of the whole world do what's right?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The LORD said, "If I find 50 good people in Sodom, I'll spare the whole place."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abraham answered, "I've dared to speak to you though I'm only dust and ashes, 28Suppose there are 45, will you destroy the whole city because of 5?" 32"Lord, don't be angry, and I'll speak just one more time. Suppose there are 10?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As soon as he'd finished talking to Abraham, he left, and Abraham went back.</span>
