## Genesis Chapter 39

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Ishmaelite traders had taken Joseph down to Egypt, and sold him to Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, captain of the bodyguard. 2The LORD was with him, so he became successful in his master's house. 3His master saw the LORD was with him to make everything he did succeed. 4He was pleased with Joseph and made him his personal servant. Joseph oversaw his household and everything he owned. 5From the time he made him overseer, the LORD around his house, everything in it and in the field. 6So he left everything in his charge. With him present, he didn't concern himself with anything except what to eat. 	                                              Gen 39:1-6a Joseph was good looking. 7His master's wife looked at him with lust and said, "Lie with me." 8But he refused, "With me here, my master doesn't concern himself with anything in the house. He's put me in charge of everything. 9There's nobody higher than me, and he hasn't withheld anything from me except you because you're his wife. How could I do such a thing and sin against God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> She hounded Joseph day after day, but he wouldn't give in to her. 11One day he went into the house to work; none of the other men were inside. 12She grabbed his cloak, "Lie with me!" He left his cloak in her hand and ran outside. 13When she saw his cloak in her hand, 14she yelled to the other men in her household, "Look, he brought us a Hebrew to abuse us. He came in to rape me. 15When I screamed, he ran out and left his cloak beside me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> She left his cloak lying beside her till her husband came home. 17Then she told him, "The Hebrew slave you brought us came in to abuse me. 18When I screamed, he left his cloak and fled outside."	    Gen 39:6b-18</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> When she said, "That's what your slave did to me," he was mad 20and put him in jail with his prisoners. 21The LORD was with Joseph and made him a favorite of the chief jailer. 22He committed the prisoners to his charge and made him responsible for whatever happened there. 23The chief jailer didn't supervise anything under his charge. The LORD prospered whatever Joseph did.</span>
