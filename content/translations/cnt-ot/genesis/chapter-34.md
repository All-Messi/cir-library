## Genesis Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Leah’s daughter Dinah went out to visit the daughters in the area. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the territory, saw her, he took her and lay with her. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He was deeply attracted to her, and loved her, and spoke tenderly to her. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Shechem spoke to his father, <em>“Get me this young girl for a wife.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jacob heard that he’d defiled Dinah, but his sons were with his livestock in the pasture; he kept quiet till they came in. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then Hamor went to speak to Jacob. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jacob’s sons came in from the pasture when they heard. They were grieved and mad, because Shechem had done such an awful thing in Israel. Something like that shouldn’t be done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But Hamor said to them, <em>“M</em><em>y son lo</em><em>ngs for your daughter. Let him marry her</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Intermarry with us.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That way you’ll live </em><em>with us</em><em>, and the </em><em>country</em><em> will be open to you.</em><em> </em><em>Live</em><em>,</em><em> carry on business</em><em>,</em><em> and buy property in it.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Shechem also told her father and brothers, <em>“If I’m pleasing to </em><em>you, I’ll give whatever you say.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Ask me whatever bridal price and gift, and I’ll give </em><em>it</em><em>, but </em><em>let</em><em> me </em><em>marry the girl</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father with deception because <em>Shechem</em> had defiled their sister<em>, </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Their proposal seemed agreeable to Hamor and Shechem. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The young man didn’t delay doing what they asked because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. He was more respected than anybody else in his father’s family. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He and Hamor went to their city gate and said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>On the third day, when the men in Shechem were very sore, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took a sword apiece and attacked the city by surprise and killed every male. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They killed Hamor and Shechem, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and left. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Jacob’s sons came on the slain and looted the city because they’d defiled their sister. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>They took their flocks, herds, donkeys, what was in the city and in the countryside. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They captured and looted their wealth, <em>took</em> their little ones, their wives, and everything in the houses. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Jacob told Simeon and Levi, <em>“You’ve </em><em>created a problem for me and mad</em><em>e</em><em> me repulsive to the Canaanites and Perizzites here. We only have a few men. They’ll gather against me and destroy me and my household.”</em></span>
