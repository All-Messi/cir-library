## Genesis Chapter 47

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, "My father and brothers, their flocks and herds, and everything they own have come from Canaan to Goshen." 2He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. 3Pharaoh asked, "We and our ancestors have been shepherds. 4We've come here to live a while. There's no pasture in Canaan because the famine's severe. Would you let us live in Goshen?" "Egypt is at your disposal. Settle your father and brothers in the best land—in Goshen. If you know any capable men among them, have them manage my livestock."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Joseph brought Jacob and introduced him to Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Pharaoh asked, "How old are you?" 9"130. My years have been few and unpleasant, not as many as my ancestors'." 10He blessed Pharaoh and went out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Joseph settled his father and brothers, and gave them a possession in Rameses, the best land in Egypt. 12He provided his father, brothers, and Jacob's household with food in proportion to how many children they had.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> There wasn't any food in the whole region because the famine was so severe. Egypt and Canaan were starving. 14Joseph collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan for the grain people bought, and brought it to Pharaoh's house. 15When the money was gone in Egypt and Canaan, the Egyptians came to Joseph, "Give us food. Why should we die in front of you? Our money's gone." 16Joseph said, "Trade your livestock for food." 17So they brought their livestock, and he gave them food in exchange for horses, flocks, herds, and donkeys that year.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> At the end of the year, they came and said, "We won't hide it from you that we've spent all our money, and the livestock belong to you. We don't have anything left except our bodies and land. 19Why should we and our land die in front of you? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be Pharaoh's slaves. Give us seed so we can stay alive, and the land won't be desolate."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Joseph bought the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his field because the famine was so severe. The land became Pharaoh's. 21He moved the people to the cities from all over Egypt. 22He didn't buy the priests' lands because they lived off their allotments from Pharaoh. 23Joseph told the people, "I've bought you and your land for Pharaoh today. Here's seed so you can sow the land. 24At harvest, give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours for planting and for feeding your household and little ones."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They said, "You've saved us! Be gracious to us, my lord, and we'll be Pharaoh's slaves." 26Joseph made it a statute about land in Egypt that's still in force: Pharaoh would have a fifth. The priests' land was all that didn't become Pharaoh's.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Israel kept living in Goshen, acquired property, and became very numerous. 28Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years, 147 years in all. 29When the time came to die, he called Joseph, "Do me a favor. Put your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth. Don't bury me in Egypt. 30When I lie down with my ancestors, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place."</span>
