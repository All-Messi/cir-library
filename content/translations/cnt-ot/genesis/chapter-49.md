<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jacob called for his sons, "Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Gather together, sons of Jacob</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Let my soul not join their council;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Cursed be their fierce anger,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Judah is a lion's whelp;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The scepter won't leave Judah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He ties his foal to a grapevine,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> His eyes are stained from wine;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When he sees how good his resting place is</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He'll be a snake along the road,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I wait for your salvation, LORD."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The archers bitterly attacked him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Your father's blessings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That's what their father told his sons when he blessed them, each with an appropriate blessing. 29Then he charged them, "I'm about to pass on to my people. Bury me with my ancestors in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30in Machpelah east of Mamre, in Canaan, in the cave Abraham bought for a burial site. 31They buried Abraham and his wife Sarah there. They buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah there. That's where I buried Leah." [32]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into bed, breathed his last, and passed on to his people.</span>
