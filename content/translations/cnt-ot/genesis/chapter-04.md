## Genesis Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Adam had relations with Eve, and she had Cain. She said, "I've 'produced' a man with the LORD's help." 2She also had Abel. Abel herded sheep; Cain cultivated the ground. 3In time, Cain brought some produce to offer to the LORD. 4Abel brought some firstborn from the best in his flock. The LORD regarded Abel and his offering favorably, 5but not Cain and his offering. It made Cain mad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD God asked him, "What are you mad about? Why are you sad? 7Won't you feel happy if you do well? If you don't, sin's making its den at your door. It wants you, but you have to overrule it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Cain told Abel about it. While they were in the field, Cain attacked him and killed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The LORD God asked him, "Where's your brother?" 10"What've you done? His blood is crying out to me from the ground. 11You're cursed from the ground that soaked up his blood that you shed. 12When you cultivate it, it won't produce like it did. You'll roam around and be on the run in the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Cain said, "I can't take such punishment! 14You've driven me away from the ground, you're withdrawing from me, and I'll be roaming around and on the run in the world. Whoever finds me will kill me!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD told him, "Whoever kills you I'll pay back seven times as much." He put a mark on him so nobody would kill him. 16He went away from the LORD and settled in Nod, east of Eden.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Cain had relations with his wife, and she had Enoch. Cain built a city and named it after his son. 18Enoch was father of Irad, father of Mehujael, father of Methushael, father of Lamech.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Lamech had two wives, Adah and Zillah. 20Adah had Jabal, the forerunner of nomads and herdsmen. 21His half-brother Jubal was the forerunner of musicians that play lyres and flutes. 22Zillah had Tubalcain, the forerunner of artisans in bronze and iron. His sister was Naamah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Lamech told his wives,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> If Cain was avenged 7 times over,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Adam had relations with his wife again, and she had a son she named Seth, because "God gave me an 'offspring' to replace Abel that Cain killed." 26Seth had a son he named Enosh.</span>
