## Genesis Chapter 4

### Cain Murders Abel

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Adam had relations with Eve, and she had Cain. She said, <em>“I’ve ‘produced’ a man with the </em>LORD<em>’s help.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She also had Abel. Abel herded sheep; Cain cultivated the ground. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>In time, Cain brought some produce to offer to the LORD. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Abel brought some firstborn from the best in his flock. The LORD regarded Abel and his offering favorably, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>but not Cain and his offering. It made Cain mad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD God asked him, <em>“What are you mad about? Why are you sad? </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Won’t you feel happy if you do well? If you don’t, sin’s making its den at </em>your<em> door. It wants you, but you have to overrule it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Cain told Abel <em>about it</em>. While they were in the field, Cain attacked him and killed him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 4:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The LORD God asked him, <em>“Where’s your brother?”</em> <em>“I don’t know. I’m not his shepherd, am I?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“What’ve you done? His blood is crying out to me from the ground. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You’re cursed from the ground that soaked up his blood that you shed. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>When you cultivate it, it won’t produce like it did. You’ll roam around and be on the run in the world.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Cain said, <em>“I can’t take such punishment! </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>You’ve driven me away from the ground, you’re withdrawing from me, and I’ll be roaming around and on the run in the world. Whoever finds me will kill me!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD told him, <em>“Whoever kills you I’ll pay back seven times as much.”</em> He put a mark on him so nobody would kill him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He went away from the LORD and settled in Nod, east of Eden.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 4:9-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Cain had relations with his wife, and she had Enoch. Cain built a city and named it after his son. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Enoch was father of Irad, father of Mehujael, father of Methushael, father of Lamech.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Lamech had two wives, Adah and Zillah. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Adah had Jabal, the forerunner of nomads and herdsmen. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>His half-brother Jubal was the forerunner of musicians that play lyres and flutes. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Zillah had Tubalcain, the forerunner of artisans in bronze and iron. His sister was Naamah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Lamech told his wives, <em>“Adah and Zillah, listen;</em> <em>	</em><em>	wives of Lamech, listen to what I’m saying.</em> <em>	I killed a man for wounding me, </em> <em>	</em><em>	a young man for striking me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> <em>If Cain was avenged 7 times over,</em> <em>	Lamech </em>will be avenged<em> 77 times.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Adam had relations with his wife again, and she had a son she named Seth, because <em>“God gave me an ‘offspring’ to replace Abel that Cain killed.” </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Seth had a son he named Enosh. People began to call on the LORD.</span>
