## Genesis Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD kept his promise to Sarah. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time God had indicated. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He named him Isaac <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and circumcised him the eighth day like God said. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Abraham</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 100</p>

### when Isaac was born. 6Sarah said, “God made me ‘laugh.’ Everybody that hears about this will laugh too. 7Who would’ve told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I’ve borne him a son in his old age.”	 Gen 21:1-7 Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a big feast the day he was weaned. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Sarah saw Hagar’s son making fun of <em>Isaac</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and told Abraham, <em>“</em><em>Get rid of</em><em> </em><em>her</em><em> and her son</em><em>. He’s not going to </em><em>inherit with </em><em>my son</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Abraham agonized over it, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>but God told him, <em>“Don’t </em><em>agonize</em><em> </em><em>over the boy and your maid. Take Sarah’s advice. Y</em><em>our lineag</em><em>e will descend through Isaac, </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>but I’ll make a nation out of the maid’s son too because he’s your descendant.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Abraham got up early and gave Hagar bread and a skin of water. He put <em>them</em> on her shoulder, <em>gave her</em> the boy, and sent her away. She wandered in the desert around Beersheba. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When the water in the skin was gone, she left him under a bush <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and sat down about a bowshot away, “<em>Don’t let me watch </em><em>him</em><em> die.</em><em>”</em> She cried out loud. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>God heard the boy crying, and his angel called to Hagar from the sky, <em>“What’</em><em>s </em><em>wrong</em><em>, Hagar?</em><em> Don’t be afraid.</em><em> God has heard the boy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>G</em><em>o get</em><em> </em><em>him </em><em>up and ho</em><em>ld him by the hand; I’ll </em><em>make a </em><em>big</em><em> nation out of him.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>God caused her to notice a well. She went and filled the skin with water and gave him a drink. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong><sup>-21</sup></strong>God was with him. He grew up and lived in the Wilderness of Paran and became an archer. His mother took a wife for him out of Egypt.</span>

### Treaty with Abimelech


<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>At that time, Abimelech and Phicol, commander of his army, said to Abraham, <em>“</em><em>God’</em><em>s with you </em><em>whatever</em><em> you</em><em> do</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>So swear </em><em>by </em><em>him</em><em> </em><em>here </em><em>that you won’t deal falsely with me</em><em> </em><em>or my descendants.</em><em> T</em><em>he kindness I’ve shown you </em><em>please s</em><em>how</em><em> </em><em>me and the land where you’ve lived</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“I swear it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>But Abraham complained to him about the well his servants had seized.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Abimelech said, <em>“I don’t know who did th</em><em>at</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I </em><em>ha</em><em>dn’t hear</em><em>d</em><em> about it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Abraham gave Abimelech sheep and cattle, and the two made a treaty. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Abraham also set</span>

### ewe lambs. 29Abimelech asked, “What are they for?”  30“Take them as a sign of agreement that I dug this well.” 31He called the place Beersheba because the two of them took an “oath” at that “well.” 32Abimelech and Phicol went back to Philistine territory. 33Abraham planted a tamarisk tree there and called on the LORD, the eternal God. 34He lived in Philistine territory quite a while.
