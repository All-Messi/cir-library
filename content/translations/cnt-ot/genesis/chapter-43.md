## Genesis Chapter 43

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The famine continued to be severe. 2When they'd eaten their grain from Egypt, their father said, "Go back and buy us a little food."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But Judah told him, "The man strictly warned us that we wouldn't see him unless our brother came with us. 4If you send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy you food. 5If you don't, we won't go."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Israel said, "Why did you do me such a bad turn by telling the man you had another brother?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They said, "He questioned us closely about us and our relatives, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' We were just answering his questions. Could we possibly know he'd say, 'Bring your brother down here'?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Judah said, "Send the boy with me, and we, you, and your children will live. 9I'll be his guarantee. Hold me responsible. If I don't bring him back, you can blame me permanently. 10If we hadn't delayed, we could have gone back twice."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Israel told them, "If it has to be that way, in your bags take some of the best things our land produces. Take them to the man as a gift—some salve, honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts, almonds. 12Take twice the money that someone put back in your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake. 13Take your brother too. 14May God Almighty [El-Shaddai] grant you mercy so he'll release your other brother and Benjamin. If I grieve, I grieve."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They took the gift, twice the money, and Benjamin, and went down to meet Joseph.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he told his palace overseer, "Bring them into the house, butcher an animal, and prepare for them to eat with me at noon." [17].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They were afraid, "Because of the money brought back the first time, he's taking us in to arrest us and make slaves out of us and our donkeys." 19They went and talked to the overseer at the entrance to Joseph's house, 20"Sir, we really did come down the first time to buy food. 21When we stopped at a place to stay and opened our sacks, each man's money was in the top of the sack. We've brought it back. 22We've brought other money to buy food this time. We don't know who put our money back in our sacks before." 23"Don't worry. Your and your father's God put your treasure in your sacks. I handled it." Then he brought Simeon out. 24He took the brothers into Joseph's house, gave them some water to wash their feet, and fed their donkeys some hay. 25They got their gift ready for when Joseph came at noon; they'd heard they were to eat a meal there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When he came home, they brought their gift into the house and bowed to the floor. 27He asked them how they were doing, "How's your elderly father? Is he still alive?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, "Is this your youngest brother you told me about? God be gracious to you, son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> He hurried out because he was deeply moved over his brother, and looked for a place to cry. He went back to his room and cried, 31then washed his face and came back. He controlled himself and said, "Serve the meal." 32they served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians that ate with him by themselves. (Egyptians wouldn't eat with Hebrews. That would have been demeaning.) 33They were sitting, the firstborn according to his birthright, the youngest according to his youth. They looked at one another amazed. 34He took portions to them from his own table; Benjamin's portion was 5 times any of theirs. They ate with him as much as they wanted.</span>
