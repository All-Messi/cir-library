## Genesis Chapter 11

### The Confusion of Languages

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The whole world was speaking the same language. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As people spread east, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They said, <em>“Let’s make bricks and fire them thoroughly.”</em><em> </em>They used brick for stone and tar for mortar.<em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Let’s</em><em> build a cit</em><em>y and a tower that reaches </em><em>the sky.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s make a name for ourselves so we won’t get scattered</em><em> out</em><em> </em><em>all </em><em>over the world.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD came down to see the city and tower they were building,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“</em><em>They’</em><em>re one </em><em>set of </em><em>people with the same language.</em><em> T</em><em>hey’re starting to do</em><em> this</em><em>, and they’ll be a</em><em>ble to do anything they want to. </em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Let’s confuse their language so they can’t understand each other.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The LORD scattered them across the world, and they stopped building their city. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They called the city Babel because that’s where the LORD “confused” the language of the world.<strong></span>
