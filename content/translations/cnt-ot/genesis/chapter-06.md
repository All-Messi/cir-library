## Genesis Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When people were multiplying and having daughters, 2the sons of God saw they were beautiful and took as many wives as they wanted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The LORD God said, "My breath won't remain in humans as long because they're physical. They'll come to live 120 years."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> There were important men then and later when the sons of God had relations with women and had children. They became powerful men of old, men of renown. 5God saw that people had become so wicked that every motive was evil. 6He was grieved from having made them. 7"I'll wipe them out along with the animals, crawling things, and birds." 8But Noah was pleasing to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Noah's Generations Noah was a good man, blameless in his time, one that followed God. 10He had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11The world had become corrupt and full of violence. [12]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> God told Noah, "It's obvious that I need to wipe people out. They've filled the world with violence. I'm going to destroy them along with the world. 14Build an ark out of gopher wood, build rooms in it, and coat it with pitch inside and out. 15Make it 450 x 75 x 45ft tall. 16Put a window in it 1½ft from the top and a door in the side of it. Build 3 floors in it. 17I'm going to bring a flood on the world to destroy everything that breathes, everything on land. 18But I'll make a covenant with you. Get in the ark with your wife, sons, and their wives. 19Take a male and female from every kind of animal to keep them alive; 20birds, animals, and crawling things will come to you. 21Gather as much food as you and the animals will eat."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Noah followed his instructions.</span>
