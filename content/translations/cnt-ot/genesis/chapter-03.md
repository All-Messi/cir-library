## Genesis Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The snake was more devious than any other wild animal the LORD God had made. It asked the woman, "Did God really tell youpl not to eat the fruit of any tree in the orchard?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> She said, "We're free to eat the fruit of any tree 3but the one in the middle of the orchard. God said not to eat its fruit or touch it. We'll die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The snake said, "You'repl not going to die! 5God knows that when youpl eat its fruit, it'll open you pl eyes, and you'llpl be like gods, knowing good and bad."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When she saw that the tree was good for food, looked nice, and was desirable for making a person wise, she ate some of its fruit and gave it to her husband, and he ate some. 7Their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together to make loin cloths.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When they heard God walking in the orchard in the evening, they hid among the trees. 9HeY called out for the man, "Where are you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The man said, "When I heard you walking in the orchard, I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid." 11"Who told you you were naked? Did you eat some fruit from the tree I told you not to?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD God asked her, "What did you do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD God told it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll put hostility</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He told the woman,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He told the man,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Adam called his wife Eve because she was the mother of everyone that's "lived." 21The LORD God made clothes for them out of skin. 22HeY said, "People have become like one of us, knowing good and bad. Now, to keep them from taking fruit from the tree of life, eating it, and living forever . . . ." 23He sent them out of the orchard to cultivate the ground he'd taken them from. 24He stationed cherubs east of the Orchard in Eden, and a flaming sword that pointed in every direction to block access to the tree of life.</span>
