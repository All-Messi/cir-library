## Genesis Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>As Jacob was going along, angels from God met him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When he saw them, he said, <em>“This </em><em>is </em><em>God’s </em><em>‘</em><em>camp</em><em>’</em><em>”</em>; so he named the place Mahanaim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He sent messengers to his brother Esau in Seir (Edom).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The messengers came back to Jacob and said, <em>“We went to Esau</em><em>;</em><em> he’s coming to meet you with </em><em>400</em><em> men.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jacob was terribly afraid and distressed. He divided the people, the flocks, herds, and camels into two companies<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“If Esau </em><em>attacks one drove</em><em>, the other can escape.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He said, <em>“God of my </em><em>grand</em><em>father Abraham and my father Isaac, </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> who </em><em>told</em><em> me</em><em> to g</em><em>o back to </em><em>my</em><em> country and </em><em>my </em><em>relatives, and </em><em>you’d</em><em> </em><em>make me prosper, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> don’t deserve the kindness and faithfulness you’ve shown me.</em><em> </em><em>I crossed this Jordan with just </em><em>a staff. N</em><em>ow I’ve become two companies.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Protect me from Esau. I’m afraid he might attack me and the mothers of my offspring. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>You did say, ‘I’ll make you prosper and make your descendants like sand on the shore that can’t be counted.’”</em><em>	</em><strong>Gen 32:1-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He spent the night there. Then he chose from what he had with him a gift for Esau: <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>30 milking camels and their colts, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He gave them to his servants, <em>“</em><em>Go</em><em> on </em><em>ahead</em><em> and space out the droves.”</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He told the first drove, <em>“When Esau meets you and asks</em><em> w</em><em>ho the</em><em>y</em><em> belong to and where you</em><em>’re</em><em> going</em><em>,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>say, ‘They belong</em><em> to</em><em> </em><em>Jacob</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’re a </em><em>gift</em><em> to </em><em>you. </em>Jacob <em>i</em><em>s behind us.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He told the second and third drove, and everybody that followed the droves,<em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“Tell Esau when you meet him, ‘Your servant Jacob is behind us too.’” </em>He said, <em>“I’ll appease him with the gift first. Then when I see him, maybe he’ll accept me.” </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>His gift passed on ahead while he spent that night in the camp.</span>

### Jacob Wrestles with a Man


<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He got up that night and took his 2 wives, 2 maids, and 11 children, and crossed the Jabbok ford. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He sent them across the stream along with what he had. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till dawn. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When <em>the man</em> saw he hadn’t won, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Then <em>the man</em> said, <em>“Let me go; it’s getting daylight.”</em><em> </em> <em> “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jacob named the place Peniel; <em>“I’</em><em>ve seen ‘God face to face,’ but I’m still alive.” </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The sun was coming up as he crossed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Israelites still don’t eat the sinew that’s on the hip socket, because <em>the man</em> struck the sinew on Jacob’s hip socket. <strong>Gen 32:22-32</strong> <strong>Jacob Meets Esau</strong></span>
