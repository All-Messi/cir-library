## 1 Samuel Chapter **28**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>At that time, the Philistines gathered their armed camps to fight Israel. Achish told David, <em>“</em><em>You can be sure </em><em>that you and your men will go out with me in the camp.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>All right</em><em>, you’ll </em><em>find out</em><em> what </em><em>I </em><em>can do.”</em> <em>“I’ll make you my bodyguard</em><em> for life</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Samuel was dead, and Israel had mourned him and buried him in Ramah, his own town. Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The Philistines gathered and camped in Shunem, and Saul gathered Israel and camped at Gilboa. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When he asked the LORD, he didn’t answer him by dreams, Urim, or prophets. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Saul told his advisors, <em>“Find a medium so I can go </em><em>ask through</em><em> her.”</em> They told him, <em>“</em><em>There’</em><em>s a woman in En</em><em>-</em><em>dor.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Saul disguised himself in different clothes and went to her with two men at night and said, <em>“Conjure up for me and bring up </em><em>the one</em><em> I name.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Surely y</em><em>ou know Saul has </em><em>expelled</em><em> the mediums and spiritists from the land.</em><em> </em><em>Why lay a </em><em>trap</em><em> to </em><em>get me killed</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Saul swore by the LORD, <em>“As</em><em> sure as</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives, you won’t be punished.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“Who do you want me to bring up?”</em> <em>“Samuel.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>When she saw Samuel, she cried out, <em>“Why have you </em><em>misled</em><em> me?</em><em> </em><em>You’re Saul.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Don’t be afraid</em><em>; what do you see?”</em><em> </em> <em>“</em><em>A</em><em> </em><em>god</em><em> coming out of the ground.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“What’s he look like?”</em> <em>“An old man</em><em>, </em><em>wearing a robe.”</em> Saul knew it was Samuel and bowed to the ground in homage.<strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Samuel said, <em>“Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”</em> <em>“I’m greatly distressed.</em><em> </em><em>The Philistines are waging war against me.</em><em> </em><em>God has </em><em>left</em><em> me and doesn’t answer me anymore by prophets or dreams.</em><em> </em><em>I’ve called you to tell me what I should do.”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“Why ask me since the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has become your adversary?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>He’</em><em>s done what he said through me:</em><em> he’s </em><em>torn the kingdom from you and given it to David.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>As you didn’</em><em>t carry out</em><em> his fierce anger on </em><em>Amalek, so he has done this</em><em> to you today.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>He’</em><em>ll deliver you </em><em>and Israel’s army </em><em>to the Philistines.</em><em> </em><em>Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me!”</em><strong>	  </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Saul fell headlong on the floor terrified. There wasn’t any strength in him; he hadn’t eaten anything all day and all night. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The woman came and saw he was terrified. She said, <em>“</em><em>I’ve done what you asked.</em><em> I’ve taken my life in my hands and listened to </em><em>you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>L</em><em>et me </em><em>fix you</em><em> </em><em>some bread so you can </em><em>have strength when you </em><em>leave</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“I’</em><em>ll d</em><em>on’t </em><em>want </em><em>anything.”</em> But she and his advisors kept urging him, so he gave in, got up off the floor, and sat on the bed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>The woman had a grain-fed calf in the house. She hurried and butchered it, kneaded flour, and baked bread without yeast. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>She brought it to Saul and his men to eat. He got up and left.<strong>	  </strong> <strong>	</strong></span>
