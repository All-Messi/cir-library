## 1 Samuel Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Samuel told Saul, "The LORD of Hosts sent me to anoint you king over his people. 2He says, 'I'm going to settle up Amalek for opposing Israel on their way up from Egypt. 3Strike him and destroy everything he has. Don't spare him. Put to death man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep, camel, and donkey.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Saul called in the people and counted them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 5He came to Amalek's city and set up an ambush in the valley. 6He told the Kenites, "Get away from the Amalekites so I won't be destroying you with them. You were kind to Israel when they came up from Egypt."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt. 8He captured Agag the king and destroyed the people with the sword. 9But he and the people spared Agag and the best sheep, cattle, grain-fed animals, lambs, and everything that was good. They didn't want to destroy them completely, just everything despised and worthless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A message from the LORD came to Samuel, 11"I've changed my mind about having Saul as king. He's not been doing what I've tell him." Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all night. 12He got up early to meet Saul. He heard that Saul had gone to Carmel to set up a monument to himself and then went on down to Gilgal."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Samuel came and Saul said to him, "The LORD's blessed you! I've done what you've said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But Samuel asked, "What's this bleating and bawling?" 15"They've brought them from the Amalekites. The people spared the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God. The rest we've destroyed." 17"Isn't it true, though you felt inadequate, the LORD made you the head over Israel? He anointed you king 18and sent you to kill off the Amalekites completely. 19Why didn't you obey him, but rushed on the spoil and did what he considered sin." 20"I did obey him; I went on his mission and brought back Agag the king and destroyed the Amalekites. 21But the people took some of the spoil—sheep and cattle, the best things devoted to destruction—to sacrifice to the LORD at Gilgal."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Samuel said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Rebellion is like fortunetelling;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Saul said, "I've sinned against his command and what you've said. I was afraid of the people and listened to them. 25Pardon my sin and go back with me so I can worship the LORD." 26"I won't go back with you. You've rejected the LORD's message, and he's rejected you from being king."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore. 28Samuel said, "The LORD has torn the kingdom from you today and given it someone better than you. 29The Glory of Israel doesn't lie or change his mind. He's not a mortal that he'd do that." 30"I've sinned, but please honor me in front of the elders and my people. Go back with me so I can worship the LORD your God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Samuel followed him back, and Saul worshiped the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag." Agag came to him relieved, "Bitter death must be past."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless." He cut Agag to pieces in the LORD's presence at Gilgal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Then he went to Ramah, but Saul went home to Gibeah. 35Samuel never saw him again; he grieved over him. The LORD changed his mind about having him be king.</span>
