## 1 Samuel Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then David went to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. He came cringing to meet David, <em>“Why are you by yourself?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>David took those comments to heart and was afraid of Achish. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>So he acted like he was crazy. He made marks on the doors of the gate, and let spit run down his beard. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Achish told his men, <em>“You can tell</em><em> the man’</em><em>s crazy.</em><em> </em><em>Why did you bring him to me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Am I short on crazy people?</em><em> </em><em>Wi</em><em>ll he come into my hou</em><em>se?”</em><em>                                                                                            </em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### David at the Case of Adullam


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The priest answered him, <em>“There’</em><em>s no ordinary bread </em><em>here; there’</em><em>s consecrate</em><em>d bread if</em><em> the young men have </em><em>not been with</em><em> women.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>David answered, <em>“W</em><em>omen have </em><em>certainly not been with us; that’s </em><em>always </em><em>the case </em><em>on an expedition.</em><em> The young men are holy even on</em><em> an ordinary journey</em><em>, much less today.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>The priest gave him the Bread of the Presence, which is removed from the LORD’s presence and replaced with fresh bread the same day. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Saul’s chief shepherd was there that day, detained in the LORD’s presence: Doeg the Edomite.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>David asked Ahimelech, <em>“Is there a spear or sword </em><em>here</em><em>?</em><em> I didn’t bring either; </em><em>the king’s matter was urgent.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The priest said, <em>“</em><em>The </em><em>sword of </em><em>Goliath that you killed in the V</em><em>alley of Elah is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod.</em><em> </em><em>If</em><em> you want to, take that. It’s the only one here</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> David said, <em>“There’s none like that one. Let me have it</em><em>.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>David fled that day from Saul to Achish, king of Gath. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>His officers asked him, <em>“Isn’t this David</em><em>,</em><em> the king of the land?</em><em> </em><em>Didn’t they sing about him in dances.</em><em> </em> <em>	“Saul has slain his thousands,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>David his ten thousands</em><em>!</em><em>’?”</em></span>
