## 1 Samuel Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> People told David, "The Philistines are attacking Keilah and robbing the threshing floors."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> David asked the LORD, "Should I attack these Philistines?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But David's men said, "We're afraid here in Judah. How much more at Keilah against the Philistines!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> David asked the LORD again. "Go down to Keilah. I'll deliver the Philistines to you." 5David and his men went down and fought them, brought away their livestock, and killed a great number of them. So he delivered the people in Keilah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Abiathar fled to David at Keilah, he brought an ephod with him. 7Saul heard that David had gone there and said, "God has delivered him to me. He has shut himself in by entering a town with gates and bars." 8Saul called the people to war, to go down to Keilah and lay siege to David and his men. 9David found out about his plot and told Abiathar to bring him the ephod.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> David said, "LORD God of Israel, I've heard that Saul intends to come to destroy the town because of me. 11Please tell me if he'll come down."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> David and his 600 men left and went wherever they could. When Saul found out he'd escaped from Keilah, he gave up the chase. 14David stayed in the strongholds and in the hill country in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul looked for him every day, but God didn't deliver David to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> David learned that Saul had come out to try to kill him while he was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 16Jonathan went to David and encouraged him in God: 17"Don't worry; my father won't find you. He knows you'll be king, and I'll be next to you." 18They made a pact in the LORD's presence. David stayed at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> People came up from Ziph to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Isn't David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the Hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon? 20Come down and do whatever you want to. We'll surrender him to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Saul said, "The LORD bless you for having mercy on me. 22Go make sure where his haunt is and who has seen him there. I'm told he's awfully cunning. 23Learn where his hiding places are, come back with exact information, and I'll go with you. If he's in the land, I'll search him out among the thousands in Judah."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They went to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men had moved into the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 25When Saul and his men went to look for him, people had told David, and he'd gone down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. 26Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side. He was hurrying to get away from Saul, because Saul and his men were surrounding him and his men to capture them. 27But a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Come quick; the Philistines are raiding the land." 28Saul quit chasing David and went to meet the Philistines. So they called the place The Rock of Escape [Sela Hammachleqot]. 29David went and stayed in the strongholds at En-gedi.</span>
