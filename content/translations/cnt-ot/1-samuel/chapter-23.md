<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>People came up from Ziph to Saul at Gibeah and said, <em>“Isn’t David hiding </em><em>among</em><em> </em><em>us in the strongholds at Horesh</em><em> on the </em><em>H</em><em>ill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>C</em><em>ome down and do whatever you want to</em><em>.

David and his men had moved into the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When Saul and his men went to look for him, people had told David, and he’d gone down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side. He was hurrying to get away from Saul, because Saul and his men were surrounding him and his men to capture them. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, <em>“</em><em>C</em><em>ome</em><em> quick;</em><em> the Philistines </em><em>are </em><em>raid</em><em>ing</em><em> the land.”</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Saul quit chasing David and went to meet the Philistines.
