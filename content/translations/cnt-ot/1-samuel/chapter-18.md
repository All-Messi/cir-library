## 1 Samuel Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When he'd finished talking to Saul, Jonathan was drawn to David and loved him as himself. 2Saul took him that day and didn't let him go back home. 3Jonathan made a pact with him because he loved him as himself. 4Jonathan took off his robe and gave it to him, along with his armor, sword, bow, and belt. 5So David went out wherever Saul sent him and was successful. Saul set him over the fighting men. The people and Saul liked that arrangement.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When David came back from killing the Philistine, the women came out of the towns, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, celebration, and musical instruments. 7They sang as they played,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> It made Saul mad. "They've attributed ten thousands to David, but thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?" 9He was suspicious of David after that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The next day a tormenting spirit from God came powerfully over Saul, and he raved in the house while David was playing the harp as usual. Saul had a spear in his hand 11and threw it, thinking he'd pin David to the wall, but he dodged him twice. 12Saul was afraid of him, because the LORD was with him, but he'd left Saul. 13So Saul put him out away from him and appointed him as commander of a thousand.  David came and went with the people. [14-15] 16All Israel and Judah loved him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then Saul told David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I'll give her to you as a wife. Just be brave for me and fight the LORD's battles." Saul was thinking, "I won't be against him; the Philistines will." 18David said, "Who am I and what is my life or my father's family in Israel, that I should be the king's son-in-law?" 19At the time she would have been given to David, she was given to Adrie of Meholah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David. They told Saul, and he liked that. 21He thought, "I'll give her to him as a snare. The Philistines will oppose him." Saul told David a second time, "You can be my son-in-law today." 22He told his men, "Tell David privately, 'The king likes you, and we do too. Go ahead and become his son-in-law.'" 23When Saul's men told David that privately, he said, "Does it seem trivial to you to become the king's son-in-law? I'm a poor man with no reputation." 24Saul's men reported what David said. 25Saul said, "Tell him the only dowry I want is 100 Philistine foreskins to avenge me of my enemies." Saul thought he'd get David killed by the Philistines. 26When his men told David, he was glad to be the king's son-in-law. Before the deadline, 27David along with his men went and killed 200 Philistines and brought their foreskins to the king. So Saul gave him Michal. 28But when Saul saw that the LORD was with him and all Israel loved him, 29he was more afraid of him and became his constant enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The commanders of the Philistines kept attacking. As often as they did, David had more success than any other officer Saul had; so he was greatly respected.</span>
