## 1 Samuel Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> David left and got to the cave near Adullam. When his brothers and father's family heard, they came down. 2Everybody in distress, in debt, or disheartened gathered to him till became the captain of about 400 men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He went from there to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king, "Please let my parents stay with you till I know what God will do for me." 4He left them with the king; they stayed with him the whole time David was in the fortress. 5The prophet Gad told David, "Don't stay in the fortress. Go to Judah." So David went to the Forest of Hereth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the hill with spear in hand and his officers standing about him. 7He told them, "Listen, you Benjamites. Will Jesse's son give you fields and vineyards? Will he make you commanders of thousands and hundreds 8that you've plotted against me? Nobody lets me know when my son teams up with Jesse's son. None of you sympathize with me or let me know that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait, like now."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Doeg, who was standing by Saul's servants, said, "I saw Jesse's son going to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub. 10He inquired from the LORD for him, and gave him provisions and Goliath's sword."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The king sent for Ahimelech the priest and all his father's family, the priests at Nob. They came to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Saul said, "Son of Ahitub, 13why have you and Jesse's son plotted against me by giving him bread and a sword, and inquiring from God for him, so that he has risen against me to lie in wait today?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Ahimelech answered, "Who among your servants is as faithful as David, your son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, honored in your family? 15Is today the first time I've asked God for him? No! You need not accuse me or my father's family of anything. I didn't know anything about this."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The king said, "You and your father's family have to die." 17He told the guard standing around him, "Kill the LORD's priests; their hand is with David. They knew he fled and didn't let me know." But his men wouldn't do it. 18So he told Doeg to fall on them. He killed 85 men that day who wore the linen ephod. 19He put Nob, the city of priests, to the sword—men and women, children and infants, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But one of Ahimelech's sons named Abiathar escaped to David 21and told him what Saul had done to the LORD's priests. 22David said, "The day Doeg was there I figured he'd tell Saul. I've occasioned the death of everybody in your father's family. 23Stay with me; don't be afraid. The one that wants to kill you wants to kill me. You'll be safe here."</span>
