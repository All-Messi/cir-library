### ,000 chosen men from all over Israel and went to look for him and his men at the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 3He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave, and went in to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. 4David’s men said, “This is the day the LORD told you he’d deliver your enemy to you.” David got up and cut off the edge of Saul’s robe secretly. 5Afterward, his conscience bothered him over it. 6He told his men, “The LORD forbid that I should reach out against his anointed.” 7He dissuaded them with that comment and didn’t let them attack Saul. Saul got up and left the cave. 	1 Sam 24:1-7


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Afterward David went out and called, <em>“My lord the king!”</em><em> </em>When Saul looked back, David bowed to the ground and prostrated himself. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Why listen to people that say</em><em> I’m</em><em> trying to harm you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou’ve seen that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> delivered you to me</em><em> today</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Some said to kill you, but </em><em>I took</em><em> pity on you and </em><em>wouldn’t</em><em> </em><em>reach</em><em> out against the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> anointed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Now, father, look</em><em> </em><em>at</em><em> the </em><em>hem</em><em> of your robe in my hand!</em><em> </em><em>Since I cut off </em><em>its</em><em> edge and didn’</em><em>t kill you, know that I’m not</em><em> </em><em>leading a </em><em>rebellion.</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em> haven’t </em><em>sinned against you</em><em> even</em><em> though you’re lying in wait to kill me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> decide between us. May he avenge me on you, but </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> won’t oppose you. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>As the ancient proverb says, ‘Sinfulness comes from the sinful.’ </em><em>I won’t oppose you. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>What did you come out against? A dead dog? A single flea? </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Let the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> decide between us. May he argue my case and deliver me from you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When David finished, Saul said, <em>“Is that </em><em>you</em><em>, David</em><em> my son</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>You’re </em><em>better </em><em>than I am.</em><em> </em><em>You’ve </em><em>been good to me while I’ve been bad to </em><em>you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>You’ve declared that you’ve done good to me, that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> delivered me to you</em><em>,</em><em> but you didn’t kill me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>If </em><em>someone</em><em> finds his enemy, will </em><em>he let him get away? May t</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> reward you with good for what you’ve done today.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>I know you’ll be king, and the kingdom will be </em><em>firmly under</em><em> your </em><em>rule</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Swear to me by the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> that you</em><em> won’t kill</em><em> my descendants </em><em>or</em><em> destroy my</em><em> name from my father’s family</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>David swore to him, and he went home. David and his men went up to the stronghold.</span>
