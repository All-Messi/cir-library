## 1 Samuel Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Samuel told Israel, "I've listened to you and appointed a king. 2Now here's the king living among you, but I'm getting old and gray; my sons are with you. I've lived among you since I was young. 3Here I am. Accuse me in the presence of the LORD and his anointed. Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Who've I defrauded or oppressed? Who've I taken a bribe from to blind me? I'll return it to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They said, "You haven't defrauded or oppressed us, or taken anything from anybody."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He said, "The LORD and his anointed are witnesses that you haven't found anything in my possession."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Samuel told the people, "The LORD appointed Moses and Aaron to bring your ancestors up from Egypt. 7Now, stand so I can remind you in his presence about the good things he did for you and your ancestors. 8When Jacob went to Egypt and your ancestors appealed to the LORD, he sent Moses and Aaron to settle them here. 9But they forgot him. So he sold them to Sisera, commander of Hazor's army, to the Philistines, to the king of Moab, and they fought them. 10They appealed to the LORD, 'We've sinned by leaving you and worshiping the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. But deliver us now from our enemies, and we'll serve you.' 11He sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and me to deliver you from enemies in every direction; so you've lived in security. 12When you saw Nahash threatening, you told me you wanted a king—although the LORD your God was your king. 13Here's the king you asked for and chose, and the LORD has put over you. 14If you'll respect, serve him, and regard his command, you and the king will be following him. 15If you disregard his command, he'll oppose you like he did your ancestors. 16Take your stand right now and see this great thing he'll do to you. 17Isn't today wheat harvest? I'll call out to him to send thunder and rain. You'll see that he considered asking for a king a bad thing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Samuel called out to the LORD, and he sent thunder and rain that day. The people feared him and Samuel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They told Samuel, "Pray for us so we won't die. We've added to our sins by asking for a king."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Samuel said, "Don't be afraid. You have done the wrong thing, but don't turn aside from serving the LORD with all your heart. 21You'd be going after pointless things that can't save. 22Because of his great name, the LORD won't abandon you. It pleased him to make you his people. 23I'll never sin against him by not continuing to pray for you. I'll instruct you in the right way. 24Just respect him and serve him sincerely. Think about the great things he's done for you. 25If you still act sinfully, he'll sweep away you and your king."</span>
