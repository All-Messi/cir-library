## 1 Samuel Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Samuel was getting older, he made his sons judges over Israel: 2Joel his firstborn and Abijah. They judged in Beersheba, 3but they didn't follow Samuel's ways. They pursued dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Israel's elders gathered to Samuel at Ramah, 5"You're getting old, and your sons don't follow your ways. Appoint a king to govern us like the other nations. 6That displeased Samuel. He prayed to the LORD, 7and the LORD said, "Listen to them. They're not rejecting you as much as rejecting me from being their king. 8As they've done ever since I brought them out of Egypt—leaving me and serving other gods—so they're doing to you. 9Give in to them but warn them solemnly how kings will rule."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Samuel told the people everything the LORD said. 11"Be aware that this is how a king will rule. He'll take your sons and appoint them to his chariots, to be his cavalry, to run ahead of his chariots. 12He'll appoint commanders of thousands and fifties, and some to plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make weapons and equipment for his chariots. 13He'll take your daughters for perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 14He'll take your best fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his officials. 15He'll take a tenth of your grain and your vineyards, and give it to his attendants. 16He'll take your male and female servants and the best of your livestock and donkeys and put them to his work. 17He'll take a tenth of your flocks, and you'll be his slaves. 18You'll cry out because you've chosen a king, but the LORD won't answer you on the matter."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But the people wouldn't listen. They said, "We want a king 20so we'll be like other nations. He can govern us and lead us in battle."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When Samuel heard what they said, he repeated it to the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The LORD said, "Give in to them and appoint a king."</span>
