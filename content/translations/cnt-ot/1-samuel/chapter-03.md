## 1 Samuel Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The boy Samuel continued to serve the LORD with Eli. A message from the LORD rarely came at that time; visions weren't frequent. 2Eli was lying down. (His eyesight had gotten bad.) 3The LORD's lamp hadn't gone out yet, and Samuel was lying down in the Tabernacle where the Ark of God was. 4The LORD called out to him. He said, "Yes?" 5He ran to Eli and said, "You called." But he said, "I didn't call; lie back down." So he went and lay down. 6The LORD called out again, "Samuel." He got up and went to Eli, "You called." But he answered, "I didn't call you, son; lie back down." 7Samuel didn't know the LORD yet, and the LORD hadn't revealed a message to him before. 8The LORD called out to him the third time. He got up and went to Eli, "You called." Eli surmised that the LORD was calling the boy. 9He told him, "Go lie down. If he calls you, say, 'Yes, LORD; I'm listening.'" So he went and lay down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The LORD came and stood and called out like before, "Samuel!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He said, "I'm about to do something in Israel that will make everybody's ears ring. 12I'll carry out against Eli everything I've said about his house from beginning to end. 13I told him I'm about to condemn his house forever for the sin he knew about. His sons have brought a curse on themselves, and he didn't restrain them. 14I've sworn to his house that sacrifice and offering won't atone for its great sin."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Samuel lay down till morning. He opened the doors of the LORD's Tabernacle, but he was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Eli called him. 17"What did he say? Don't hold it back from me. God do so to you and more if you keep back anything he said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Samuel told him everything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Samuel grew, the LORD was with him, and didn't let any of his message fail. 20Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew he was confirmed as a prophet for the LORD. 21[4:1]The LORD appeared again at Shiloh and revealed himself to Samuel in a message.</span>
