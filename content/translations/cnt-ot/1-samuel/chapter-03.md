## 1 Samuel Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The boy Samuel continued to serve the LORD with Eli. A message from the LORD rarely came at that time; visions weren’t frequent. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Eli was lying down. (His eyesight had gotten bad.) <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The LORD’s lamp hadn’t gone out yet, and Samuel was lying down in the Tabernacle where the Ark of God was. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The LORD called out to him. He said, <em>“Yes?”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He ran to Eli and said, <em>“You called</em><em>.”</em> But he said, <em>“I didn’t call</em><em>; lie back down.”</em> So he went and lay down. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The LORD called out again, <em>“Samuel.</em><em>”</em> He got up and went to Eli, <em>“You called</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>But he answered, <em>“I didn’t call you, son; lie </em><em>back </em><em>down.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Samuel didn’t know the LORD yet, and the LORD hadn’t revealed a message to him <em>before</em>. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The LORD called out to him the third time. He got up and went to Eli, <em>“You called</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>Eli surmised that the LORD was calling the boy. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He told him, <em>“Go lie </em><em>down. I</em><em>f he calls you, say, ‘Yes, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>; I’m listening.’”</em> So he went and lay down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>The LORD came and stood and called out like before, <em>“Samuel!”</em><em> </em> He said, <em>“Yes, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, I’m listening.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>He said, <em>“I’m about to do something in Israel that</em><em> will make everybody’s ears ring</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>I’ll carry out against Eli every</em><em>thing I’ve said about his house</em><em> from beginning to end.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I told him I’m about to </em><em>condemn</em><em> his house forever</em><em> for the sin he knew about. H</em><em>is sons </em><em>have </em><em>brought a curse on themselves</em><em>,</em><em> and he didn’t restrain them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I’ve sworn to </em><em>his </em><em>house that </em><em>sacrifice and offering won’t atone for its</em><em> great </em><em>sin</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Samuel lay down till morning. He opened the doors of the LORD’s Tabernacle, but he was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Then Eli called him. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“What did he say?</em><em> Don’t hold</em><em> it </em><em>back </em><em>from me.</em><em> </em><em>God do so to you and more if you </em><em>keep back anything </em><em>he said.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Samuel told him everything. <em>“It’s the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. L</em><em>et him do what </em><em>he thinks is right</em><em>.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	   </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><strong>Samuel</strong> grew, the LORD was with him, and didn’t let any of his message fail. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew he was confirmed as a prophet for the LORD. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><strong><sup>[4:1]</sup></strong>The LORD appeared again at Shiloh and revealed himself to Samuel in a message.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong></span>
