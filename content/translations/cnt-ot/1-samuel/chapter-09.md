<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A wealthy man in Benjamin named Kish son of Abiel (son of Zeror son of Becorath son of Aphiah) <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There wasn’t a man in Israel more handsome than he was. He was head and shoulders taller than everybody.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Kish’s donkeys were lost so he told Saul to t<em>a</em>ke a servant and look for them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They went through the hill country of Ephraim, through the territory around Shalishah, Shaalim, and Benjamin, but couldn’t find them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>When they came to the area around Zuph, Saul told his servant, <em>“Let’s go back so my father doesn’t stop </em><em>caring</em><em> about the donkeys and </em><em>start</em><em> </em><em>worrying</em><em> about us.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>But <em>the servant</em> said, <em>“There’s a man of God in this </em><em>town</em><em> that people </em><em>regard highly</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Everything he says comes true.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s go there; maybe he</em><em> can tell us about the trip we’r</em><em>e on.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Saul said, <em>“</em><em>I</em><em>f we go, what can we </em><em>take him</em><em>?</em><em> We don’t have any bread left in our sacks;</em><em> </em><em>we don’t have a present</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>What do we have?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The servant answered, <em>“I have</em><em> </em><em>a tenth of an oz</em><em> </em><em><sup>a fourth of a shekel</sup></em><em> of silver</em><em>.</em><em> I’ll give it to him to tell us where to go.”</em><em> </em>(<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Earlier in Israel, when someone went to ask God, they’d say, <em>“Let’s go to the seer.”</em> What they call a prophet they used to call a seer.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Saul said, <em>“</em><em>All right</em><em>.”</em> They went to the town where the man of God was.<strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>As they went up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water and asked them if<em> </em>the seer was there.<em> </em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Yes, he’s </em><em>up ahead of you.</em><em> </em><em>Hurry; he just now</em><em> got here for</em><em> </em><em>a sacrifice the</em><em> people have on the high place</em><em> </em><em>today.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>As soon as you go in</em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>town</em><em>, you’ll find him before he g</em><em>oes up to the high place to eat. T</em><em>he people won’t eat till he comes to bless the sacrifice.</em><em> </em><em>Afterwards the ones that are invited</em><em> will </em><em>eat.</em><em> </em><em>Go up; you’ll meet him right away.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>They went up to the town. As they were going in, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way to the high place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“About this time tomorrow I’ll send</em><em> you a man from Benjamin.</em><em> </em><em>Anoint him to </em><em>rule</em><em> over my people.</em><em> </em><em>He’ll save </em><em>them</em><em> from the Philistines</em><em>.</em><em> I’ve seen </em><em>my people’s suffering; t</em><em>heir </em><em>out</em><em>cry has come</em><em> to me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, <em>“</em><em>He’</em><em>s the man I </em><em>told</em><em> you about.”</em><em> </em><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Samuel answered him, <em>“I’m the seer. G</em><em>o </em><em>on </em><em>up ahead of me to the high place</em><em> and</em><em> eat with me</em><em>. I</em><em>n the morning I’ll let you go</em><em> and</em><em> tell you everything that’s on your mind.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Don’t worry about the</em><em> donkeys </em><em>you</em><em> lost three days ago</em><em>. T</em><em>hey’ve been fo</em><em>und.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Who is to receive everything that’s desirable in Israel? </em><em>Isn’t it you and your father’s </em><em>family</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Saul answered, <em>“Am I not a Benjam</em><em>ite, from the smallest tribe in Israel?</em><em> </em><em>Isn’t my family the </em><em>least important</em><em> </em><em>one</em><em> in the tribe?</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>did</em><em> you s</em><em>ay that</em><em>?”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
