## 1 Samuel Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The men came and took it to Abinadab's house on the hill. They consecrated his son Eleazar to take charge of it. 2It was there some 20 years, and Israel mourned after the LORD.   	1 Sam 6:19-7:2</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then Samuel told Israel, "If you're coming back to the LORD with all your heart, put away the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. Direct your heart to serve him only, and he'll deliver you from the Philistines." 4Israel got rid of the images of Baal and Ashtoreth and served the LORD only.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Samuel said, "Gather Israel to Mizpah, and I'll pray to the LORD for you." 6They gathered there, drew water, and poured it out to the LORD. They fasted that day and said, "We've sinned against the LORD." Samuel judged Israel at Mizpah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When the Philistines heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they went up to attack them. The people heard about it and were afraid. 8They told Samuel, "Don't stop calling out to the LORD our God for us to save us from the Philistines." 9He offered up a suckling lamb as a whole burnt offering. He appealed to the LORD for Israel, and he answered him. 10As he was offering it, the Philistines came to attack; but the LORD thundered with a loud noise that threw them into a panic. 11Israel chased them and kept striking them down as far as below Beth-car.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Samuel set up a "rock" between Mizpah and Shen. He called it Ebenezer because the LORD had 'helped' them that far. 13The Philistines didn't invade Israel again. The LORD opposed them Samuel's whole life. 14The towns they'd taken reverted to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel rescued its territory from them. Israel and the Amorites were at peace too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Samuel judged Israel his whole life 16on a circuit each year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. 17Then he'd come back to his house in Ramah. He administered justice there as well and built an altar to the LORD.</span>
