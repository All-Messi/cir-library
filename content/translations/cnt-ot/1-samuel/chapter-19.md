## 1 Samuel Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Saul told Jonathan and his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan really delighted in David. 2He told David, "My father is trying to get you killed. Be on guard in the morning. Hide in a private place. 3I'll go out and stand beside him in the field where you are and talk about you. If I find out anything out, I'll tell you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul, "Don't sin against David. He hasn't sinned against you; what he's done has benefited you. 5He took his life in his hands and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and were happy. Why sin against innocent blood by putting him to death?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Saul listened and swore, "As surely the LORD lives, I won't do it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then Jonathan called David and told him. He brought David to Saul, and he was with him like before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When war arose again, David went out and massacred the Philistines. They fled from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A tormenting spirit from the LORD came on Saul as he was sitting at home with his spear in hand. David was playing his harp. 10Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he dodged and the spear stuck in the wall. David ran away and escaped that night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Saul sent troops to David's house to watch him and put him to death in the morning. But David's wife Michal told him, "If you don't save your life tonight, you'll be killed tomorrow." 12She let David down through the window, and he got away. 13She took the household idol and laid it on the bed; she put a pillow of goats' hair at its head and covered it with blankets. 14When Saul sent troops arrived, she said, "He's sick." 15Saul sent troops back, saying, "Bring him to me on his bed so I can put him to death." 16When they went in, the household idol was on the bed with the pillow of goats' hair under its head. 17Saul asked Michal, "Why did you lie to me and let my enemy escape?" Michal said, "He told me, 'Let me go! Why should I kill you?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> David escaped to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went to stay in Naioth. 19Saul heard that David was at Naioth in Ramah. 20He sent troops to take him, but when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came on them and they prophesied too. 21When Saul learned about it, he sent some other troops, and they prophesied. He sent troops a third time, and they prophesied. 22Then Saul went to Ramah himself. He came to the big well in Secu and asked where Samuel and David were. One person said, "They're at Naioth in Ramah." 23He went on to Naioth, and the Spirit of God came on him. As he went, he kept prophesied till he got to Naioth. 24He, too, took off his clothes and prophesied in Samuel's presence; he lay naked all day and all night. That's why people say, "Is Saul among the prophets too?"</span>
