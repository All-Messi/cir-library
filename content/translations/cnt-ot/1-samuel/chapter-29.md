## 1 Samuel Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Philistines gathered their forces to Aphek while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezreel. 2The Philistine lords were moving forward by hundreds and thousands; David and his men were moving forward in the rear with Achish. 3The commanders of the Philistines said, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" Achish said, "Isn't this David, Saul's servant, that's been with me these days, or years? I haven't found a fault in him from the day he deserted to me till now." 4But the commanders were mad, "Make him go back to where you've assigned him. Don't let him go down to battle with us and become our adversary during the fight. For how could he make himself acceptable to his lord? Wouldn't it be with the heads of these men? 5Isn't this David they sang about in the dances,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Achish called David, "As sure as the LORD lives, you've been upright. Your conduct with me in the army is fine. I haven't found anything bad in you since you came, but the other Philistine lords don't want you here. 7Go back quietly so you won't upset them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> David asked him, "What have I done? What have you found in me since I came to you, that I can't go and fight my king's enemies?" 9"You're pleasing to me, like an angel of God, but the commanders have said you can't go into battle with us. 10Get up early with your men and leave as soon as it gets daylight."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> David and his men got up early to go back to the land of the Philistines. Then the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</span>
