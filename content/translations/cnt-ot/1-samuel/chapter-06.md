## 1 Samuel Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD’s Ark was in Philistine territory for seven months. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They called for the priests and fortunetellers, <em>“</em><em>What </em><em>should we</em><em> do with </em><em>it</em><em>?</em><em> Tell us how to send it back</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Send it back with</em><em> a guilt offering</em><em> to Israel’s God</em><em>.</em><em> Y</em><em>ou’ll be healed, and </em><em>you’ll find out</em><em> why </em><em>he keeps working against</em><em> you.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>What </em><em>gui</em><em>lt offering should we send </em><em>him?”</em><em>   </em> <em>“Five gold tumors and five gold</em><em> mice, </em><em>to match</em><em> the number of </em><em>Philistine lords. The same plague has struck</em><em> you and your lords.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>So make</em><em> images of your </em><em>tumors and the </em><em>mice that are ravaging the land and </em><em>honor Israel’s God. </em><em>Maybe he’ll lighten his </em><em>oppression on</em><em> you, your gods, and your land.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Why harden your hearts like </em><em>Pharaoh and </em><em>the Egyptians </em><em>did? After he’</em><em>d m</em><em>ocked </em><em>them</em><em>, didn’t they end up letting the people go</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Build</em><em> a new cart and take two milk cows that have never worn a yoke.</em><em> </em><em>Yoke them to the cart but take their cal</em><em>ves </em><em>away from them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Put the Ark on the cart. I</em><em>n a box </em><em>be</em><em>side </em><em>it </em><em>put the</em><em> gold</em><em> figur</em><em>in</em><em>es you’re returning to him as a guilt offering.</em><em> S</em><em>end it off, and </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>w</em><em>atch</em><em> it. I</em><em>f it goes on the road to </em><em>Beth-</em><em>shemesh </em><em>in </em><em>its own land, he’s the one that has done us this great harm.</em><em> </em><em>If not, we’ll know </em><em>i</em><em>t happened by chance.”</em><strong>    </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Then Samuel told Israel, <em>“If you’</em><em>re </em><em>coming back</em><em> to th</em><em>e </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> with all your heart,</em><em> put away the for</em><em>eign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. D</em><em>irect your heart to </em><em>serve him </em><em>only, and he’ll deliver you from the Philistines.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Israel got rid of the images of Baal and Ashtoreth and served the LORD only.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Samuel said, <em>“Gather Israel </em><em>to</em><em> Mizpah, and I’ll pray to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> for you.”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They gathered there, drew water, and poured it out to the LORD. They fasted that day and said, <em>“We’</em><em>ve sinned against the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong>Samuel</strong> judged Israel at Mizpah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>When the Philistines heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they went up to attack them. The people heard about it and were afraid. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They told Samuel, <em>“Don’t stop call</em><em>ing </em><em>out </em><em>to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> our </em><em>God for us</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> save us from the Philistines.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He offered up a suckling lamb as a whole burnt offering. He appealed to the LORD for Israel, and he answered him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>As he was offering it, the Philistines came to attack; but the LORD thundered with a loud noise that threw them into a panic. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Israel chased them and kept striking them down as far as below Beth-car.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 7:3-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>They yoked two milk cows to the cart, shut up their calves at home, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and put the Ark on the cart along with a box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh along one road without veering off, bawling as they went. The lords of the Philistines followed them as far as the outskirts of Beth-shemesh. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The people there were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the Ark, they were overjoyed. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>It came and stopped in a field that belonged to Joshua of Beth-shemesh. There was a large rock there. They split up the wood from the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Levites took down the Ark and the box and set them on the large rock. The men of Beth-shemesh offered sacrifices and burnt offerings that day. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The five lords of the Philistines saw it and went back to Ekron.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then Samuel set up a “rock” between Mizpah and Shen. He called it Ebenezer because the LORD had ‘helped’ them that far<em>.</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The Philistines didn’t invade Israel again. The LORD opposed them Samuel’s whole life. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The towns they’d taken reverted to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel rescued its territory from them. Israel and the Amorites were at peace too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Samuel judged Israel his whole life <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>on a circuit each year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Then he’d come back to his house in Ramah. He administered justice there as well and built an altar to the LORD.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Israel Demands a King


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>As a guilt offering to the LORD, the Philistines returned one gold <u>tumor</u> each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The gold <u>mice</u> matched the number of fortified towns and unwalled villages that belonged to the five Philistine lords. The large rock they set the Ark by is still a witness in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### men from Beth-shemesh because they looked in the Ark. The people mourned because he’d killed so many. 20Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who can stand against this holy God? Who will go up when he leaves us?” 21They sent messengers to Kiriath-jearim, “The Philistines have brought back the Ark of the LORD. Come down and get it.” 7:1The men came and took it to Abinadab’s house on the hill. They consecrated his son Eleazar to take charge of it. 2It was there some 20 years, and Israel mourned after the LORD.   	1 Sam 6:19-7:2 Samuel Judges Israel
