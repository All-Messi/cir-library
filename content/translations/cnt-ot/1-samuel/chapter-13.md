## 1 Samuel Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Saul was 40 when he began to rule and ruled for 32 years. 2He chose 3,000 men from Israel, 2,000 to be with him in Michmash and the hill country around Bethel and 1,000 to be with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent the rest home. 3Jonathan struck the Philistine garrison in Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the ram's horn all over the land and said, "Hebrews, listen." 4All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison and that Israel had become repulsive to the Philistines. So Saul called the people to Gilgal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The Philistines came together to fight Israel with 3,000LXX chariots, 6,000 cavalry, and people like sand on a shore. They camped in Michmash east of Beth-aven. 6Israel saw they were in a predicament. (The people were hard-pressed.) They hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, cellars, cisterns. 7Some Hebrews crossed the Jordan to Gad in Gilead. Saul stayed in Gilgal, and the people followed him trembling.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He waited for the week Samuel appointed, but Samuel didn't come, and the people started leaving. 9So he told them to bring him the burnt offering and peace offerings. He offered the burnt offering. 10No sooner had he finished offering it than Samuel came. Saul went out to greet him, 11but Samuel said, "What have you done?" 	1 Sam 13:5-11a "The people were leaving, you didn't come by the appointed time, and the Philistines were assembling at Michmash. 12I said the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I haven't asked for the LORD's blessing. I went ahead and offered the burnt offering."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Samuel told Saul, "You've done something foolish. You haven't kept the commandment the LORD gave you. He would've made your kingdom secure permanently, 14but not now. He has looked for a man after his own heart to appoint as ruler over his people, because you haven't done what he told you."  	1 Sam 13:11b-14</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then Samuel went up from Gilgal to Gibeah. Saul counted the people with him, about 600 men. 16He, his son Jonathan, and the people with them were staying at Geba in Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash. 17Three raiding parties went out from the Philistines': one toward Ophrah in the area around Shual, 18another toward Beth-horon, and the other toward the borderland that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim near open country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> There weren't any blacksmiths in Israel, so the Hebrews couldn't make swords or spears. 20They had to go down to the Philistines to sharpen their forks, plowshares, picks, axes, and goads, and to fix their goad points. 21They charged the Israelites ¼ oz two-thirds of a shekel of silver for sharpening plowshares and picks and ⅛ oz a third of a shekel for sharpening forks, axes, and goads. 22The day of the battle, none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had swords or spears, just Saul and Jonathan. 23A Philistine contingent went out to secure the pass by Michmash.</span>
