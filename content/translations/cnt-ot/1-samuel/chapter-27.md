## 1 Samuel Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> David said to himself, "Someday Saul is going to kill me. All I can do is escape to the Philistines. He'll get tired of looking for me in Israel, and I'll get away from him." 2David and his 600 men crossed over to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath. 3They lived with Achish, each with his family and David with his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow. 4Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, so he quit looking for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then David told Achish, "If I'm pleasing to you, have them give me a place in a town out in the country. Why should I live in the royal city with you?" 6Achish gave him Ziklag. It still belongs to Judah's kings. 7He lived among the Philistines for a year and four months.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; because they had lived in the land from ancient times, toward Shur all the way to Egypt. 9He attacked the land and didn't leave a man or woman alive. He brought back to Achish the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing. 10Achish asked, "Where did you raid today?" David said, "In the Negev of Judah, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites." 11David didn't leave anyone alive to bring to Gath and said, "So they won't say about us, 'That's been David's practice ever since he lived among the Philistines.'" 12Achish believed David, "He has surely made himself repulsive to his people; he'll serve me from now on."</span>
