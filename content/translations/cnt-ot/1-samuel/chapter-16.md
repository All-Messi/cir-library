## 1 Samuel Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD said to Samuel, "How long are you going to grieve over Saul? I've set him aside from being king. Fill your horn with olive oil and go to Jesse of Bethlehem. I've selected a king from his sons."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Samuel said, "How can I go there? When Saul hears about it, he'll kill me." "Take a heifer with you and say you've come to sacrifice to the LORD. 3Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I'll show you what to do. Anoint the one I specify."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Samuel went to Bethlehem. The city elders came trembling, "Are you coming in peace?" 5"Yes, I've come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and go with me to the sacrifice." He consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When they came in, Samuel looked at Eliab and thought, "Surely that's the LORD's anointed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But the LORD said, "Don't look at his height or appearance. I haven't chosen him. I don't see like people do. They look at appearance; I look at hearts."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Next, Jesse presented Shammah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesse presented seven of his sons, but Samuel told Jesse, "The LORD hasn't chosen any of these. 11Are they all your young men?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He sent and brought him in, a barefaced young man with bright eyes and handsome features.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Samuel took the horn of olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD stirred him powerfully from then on. Samuel went to Ramah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The Spirit of the LORD left Saul, and a tormenting spirit from the LORD started coming on him. 15His servants told him. "A tormenting spirit from God is coming on you. 16Have us look for a man that's good at playing a harp so you'll feel better."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So Saul said, "Bring me a man like that."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> One young man answered, "I've seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite that's a good musician, as well as a brave man, a soldier, prudent in speech, and a handsome fellow. The LORD is with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Saul sent messengers to Jesse, "Send me your son David that tends your flock."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Jesse took a young goat, a donkey loaded with bread, and a jug of wine, and sent them to Saul with David. 21He went to Saul and became his attendant. Saul liked him and made him his armor bearer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Saul sent to Jesse, "Let David remain with me. I like him." 23Whenever an evil spirit from God came over Saul, David would take his harp and play it. Saul would be refreshed and feel better. The tormenting spirit would go away.</span>
