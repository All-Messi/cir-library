## 1 Samuel Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham son of Elihu (son of Tohu son of Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn't.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he'd give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he'd give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But the LORD had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to the LORD's Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She'd cry and wouldn't eat. 8Elkanah asked her, "Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Hannah got up after the meal, while Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the LORD'S Tabernacle. 10She was distressed, and prayed and cried bitterly. 11She took a vow, "LORD of Hosts, if you'll look on my grief and give me a son, I'll give him to you all his life. He'll never shave his head."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Eli was watching her mouth as she prayed. 13Her lips were moving, but she wasn't making any sound. Eli thought she was drunk. 15"No, my lord, I'm depressed. I haven't drunk wine or alcohol. I'm pouring out my heart to the LORD. 16Don't consider me some worthless woman. I've been speaking out of my great anguish and distress."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They got up early and worshiped in the LORD's presence and went back to Ramah. Elkanah had relations with Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. 20In due time, she had a son and named him Samuel, "Because I've 'asked' the LORD for him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Elkanah went up with his whole family to offer the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow. 22But Hannah wouldn't go, "I won't go till I've weaned him. Then I'll present him to the LORD to stay there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Elkanah said, "Do what you think's best. Wait till you've weaned him. May the LORD confirm his word." She stayed and nursed him till she weaned him. 24Then she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, 1.1 bushel 1 ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She took him to the LORD's Tabernacle in Shiloh even though the child was so young. 25They butchered the bull and took the boy to Eli. 26She said, "As sure as you're alive, Sir, I'm the woman that stood here beside you, praying to the LORD. 27I prayed for this boy, and the LORD gave me what I asked for. 28I've dedicated him to the LORD for as long as he lives."</span>
