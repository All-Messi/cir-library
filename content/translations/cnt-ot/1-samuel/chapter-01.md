## 1 Samuel Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham son of Elihu (son of Tohu son of Zuph), an Ephraimite. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But the LORD had closed her womb, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>year after year. As often as she went up to the LORD’s Tabernacle, <em>Peninnah</em> would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Elkanah asked her, <em>“Hannah, wh</em><em>y are you crying and not eating? W</em><em>hy are you </em><em>sad</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Am I not better to you than ten sons?”</em><strong> </strong><strong>  </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 1:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Hannah got up after the meal, while Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the LORD’S Tabernacle. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>She was distressed, and prayed and cried bitterly. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>She took a vow, <em>“</em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> of </em><em>H</em><em>osts, if you’ll look on</em><em> my grief</em><em> and give </em><em>me</em><em> a son, I’ll give him to </em><em>you </em><em>all his life</em><em>. He’ll never shave</em><em> his head.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Eli was watching her mouth as she prayed. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Her lips were moving, but she wasn’t making any sound. Eli thought she was drunk. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“How long will you </em><em>be</em><em> drunk?</em><em> </em><em>Put your wine away.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“No, my lord, I’m </em><em>depressed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I haven’t drunk wine </em><em>or alcohol.</em><em> I</em><em>’m</em><em> </em><em>pouring out my heart</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Don’t consider </em><em>me some</em><em> worthless woman</em><em>.</em><em> I’ve </em><em>been speaking </em><em>out of my great </em><em>anguish</em><em> and </em><em>distress</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“May </em><em>God grant your petition.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Be gracious to me</em><em>.”</em> So she went away and ate and wasn’t sad anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>They got up early and worshiped in the LORD’s presence and went back to Ramah. Elkanah had relations with Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In due time, she had a son and named him Samuel, <em>“Because I’ve </em><em>‘</em><em>asked</em><em>’</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>for him.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### Hannah Dedicates Samuel


<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Elkanah went up with his whole family to offer the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But Hannah wouldn’t go, <em>“I</em><em> won’t go</em><em> till </em><em>I’ve weaned him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Then I’ll </em><em>present him</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>to </em><em>stay there.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Elkanah said<em>, “Do what </em><em>you think’s best. Wait till you’ve weaned him. M</em><em>ay the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> confirm his word.”</em> She stayed and nursed him till she weaned him. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Then she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, 1.1 bushel <sup>1 </sup><sup>ephah</sup> of flour, and a skin of wine. She took him to the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em> Tabernacle in Shiloh even though the child was so young. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>They butchered the bull and took the boy to Eli. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>She said, <em>“</em><em>As sure as you’re a</em><em>live,</em><em> Sir, </em><em>I’m the woman that stood here beside you, praying to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>I prayed for this boy</em><em>,</em><em> and th</em><em>e</em> <em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>gave me what I asked </em><em>for.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>I’ve dedicated him to the</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>for as long as he lives</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> He worshipped the LORD there.<strong>	 </strong></span>
