## Zechariah Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD About Israel This is what the LORD says who stretched out the sky, laid earth's foundation, and formed the human spirit: 2"I'm going to make Jerusalem a cup that makes every nation stagger who lays siege to Jerusalem and Judah. 3I'll make Jerusalem a heavy rock; any nation that tries to pick it up will rupture itself. When nations surround it, 4I'll make their horses bolt and their riders panic, but I'll watch over Judah as I strike those enemies' horses blind. 5The clans in Judah will realize that the residents of Jerusalem have strong protection from the LORD of Hosts their God.' 6"At that time, I'll make the clans in Judah like a fire pot in a woodpile, a torch among bundles of grain. They'll consume the nations around them while Jerusalem stays safe. 7The LORD will save the people in Judah first so David's royal line and Jerusalem won't have greater glory than the rest of Judah. 8The weakest among the people in Jerusalem will be as strong as David, and his descendants will lead them out like God, like the angel of the LORD. 9I'll destroy any nation that attacks Jerusalem. 10"I'll pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on David's family and the people in Jerusalem so they'll look at me that they've speared. They'll mourn for me like people mourn for an only son or a firstborn son. 11There'll be extreme mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning for Hadad-rimmon on the Plain of Megiddo. 12Each clan in Israel will mourn by itself, husbands and wives separately: the clans of Nathan, 13Levi, the Shimeites, and 14the rest.</span>
