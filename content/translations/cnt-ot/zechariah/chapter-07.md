## Zechariah Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Fourth Day, Ninth Month (Chislev), Fourth Year of King Darius</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The people in Bethel had sent Sharezer, Regem-melech, and their men to ask for the LORD's blessing. 3They spoke to the priests in the LORD's Temple and to the prophets, "Should we keep mourning and fasting in the fifth month like we've done all these years?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A Message from the LORD to Me 5"Tell the priests and people in the land, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months those 70 years, were you really fasting for me? 6And now when you eat and drink, aren't you eating and drinking for yourselves? 7Isn't that the same message the LORD delivered by the former prophets to the people in Jerusalem when it and its towns were prospering, and people were living in the Negev and western foothills?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A Message from the LORD to Zechariah 9"The LORD of Hosts says, 'Judge fairly, practice kindness and mercy with each other. 10Don't oppress widows and orphans, foreigners or poor people. Don't plot against one another.' 11But your ancestors refused to pay attention, turned a stubborn shoulder, and covered their ears. 12They hardened their hearts like flint so they couldn't hear the Law and what Yahveh had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. That's why he was so angry with them. 13Just as he called and they wouldn't listen, so they called and he wouldn't listen. 14With a tornado he scattered them throughout foreign nations. The land they left lay so desolate nobody traveled through it. They'd turned their pleasant land into a wasteland."</span>
