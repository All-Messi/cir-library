## Zechariah Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he showed me Joshua/Jeshua the high priest standing in front of the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing to his right to accuse him. 2The LORD told Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! I who chose Jerusalem reject your accusations! Isn't this man a brand snatched out of the fire?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Joshua's clothes were dirty, 4so the angel told the ones standing there, "Change his dirty clothes." "I've taken your sinfulness off so I can dress you up with festive robes."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I said, "Have them put a clean turban on him too." So they dressed him up while the angel of the LORD stood by.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The angel charged Joshua, 7"The LORD of Hosts says, 'If you follow me and do your service, you'll have charge of my Temple and courts. I'll let you have free access along with the ones that are standing here. 8Listen, Joshua, you and your friends sitting in front of you are symbols, because I'm going to bring in my servant the Branch. 9Look at the stone I've put in front of Joshua, a single stone with seven facets. I'll engrave an inscription on it and remove the sinfulness of the land in one day. 10At that time, each one of you will invite your friend to sit under your vine and fig tree.'"</span>
