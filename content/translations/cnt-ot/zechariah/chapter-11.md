## Zechariah Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Open your doors, Lebanon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Wail, cypress trees, for the fallen cedars;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The shepherds wail</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The LORD my God says, "Pasture the flock that's doomed to slaughter. 5The buyers butcher them without remorse. The sellers say, 'Praise the LORD, I'm rich!' Their own shepherds don't care about them! 6I won't have mercy on people like that. I'll let them fall into each other's hands and the hands of their king. They'll ruin the land, and I won't protect it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So I began pasturing the flock that was doomed to slaughter by the ones that trafficked in sheep. I took two staffs; I called one Favor and the other Unity, and I tended the flock with them. 8I fired three worthless shepherds in one month. I also lost patience with the sheep, and they lost interest in me. 9I told them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The staff I called Favor I cut in pieces to demonstrate that I was breaking the covenant I'd made with all the nations. 11That day, the ones that trafficked in sheep realized the LORD was acting out a message through me. 12I told them, "If you want, pay me; if not, keep it!" So they weighed out 12 oz 30 shekels of silver to pay me. 13The LORD told me, "Throw them to the potter, that grand value they put on me!" So I threw them to the potter in the LORD's Temple. 14Then I cut in pieces the staff I called Unity to demonstrate that I was breaking the alliance between Judah and Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD told me, "Again, dress up like a worthless shepherd. 16I'm going to show the land a picture of a shepherd that won't take care of the dying, look for the strays, heal the injured, or feed the healthy. He'll eat the healthy ones and tear off their hoofs.</span>
