## Zechariah Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The angel came back and brought me to as if I'd been asleep. 2He asked me what I saw. "A gold lampstand with its bowl of oil on top, as well as its seven lamps with one spout apiece. 3I see an olive tree on each side of it. 4What do they mean, Sir?" 6"This is what the LORD tells Zerubbabel, 'Not by force, not by power, but by my Spirit. 7Not even a big mountain will be able to get in your way. You'll set the cap stone for the Temple amid shouts of "God bless it!! God bless it!"'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A Message from the LORD to Me 9"Zerubbabel has laid the foundation for the Temple, and he'll finish it. Then you'll know the LORD of Hosts is the One that sent me to youpl. 10Whoever has been disappointed during the time of small beginnings will be happy when they see Zerubbabel holding a plumb line. These seven lamps represent the LORD's eyes that scan back and forth over the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I asked, "What do the two olive trees beside the lampstand represent? 12What do the two olive branches represent beside the two gold tubes that drain out the golden oil?" 14"They represent the two anointed ones that stand beside the Lord of the whole world."</span>
