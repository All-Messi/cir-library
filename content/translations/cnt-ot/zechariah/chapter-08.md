## Zechariah Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD 2"The LORD of Hosts says, 'I'm jealous for Zion. 3I'll come back to live in Jerusalem, and it'll be called The City of Truth. My mountain will be called The Holy Mount. 4Old men and women will sit in its streets again with staffs in hand because they're old. 5Boys and girls will play in the streets. 6If that sounds incredible to the remnant that's left, does that make it incredible for me?  7I'm going to save my people from lands east and west 8and bring them back to live here. They'll be my people, and I'll be their God, faithful and just.' 9"Be strong, you that are listening to this message from the prophets who spoke when the foundation of my Temple was being laid so it could be completely rebuilt. 10Before then there weren't any jobs. Because criminals were everywhere, travelers weren't safe; everybody was working against everybody else. 11But I won't treat the remnant like that now. 12Their descendants will have peace, the grapevines will bear fruit, the ground will grow produce, the sky will drop dew. The remnant will inherit those things. 13Just as you were a curse among the nations, Judah and Israel, so I'll save you to become a blessing. Don't be afraid; be strong. 14"Just as I planned to punish you when your ancestors were so offensive to me and I didn't hold back, 15so now I intend to treat Jerusalem and Judah well. Don't be afraid! 16To have peace around you, tell the truth and judge honestly. 17Don't make plots or commit perjury. I despise things like that."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> A Message from the LORD to Me 19"The LORD of Hosts says, 'The fasts in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will be a joy for Judah; so love honesty and peace. 20People from cities all around will attend. 21One city will go to another one and say, "Let's travel together to look up to the LORD and ask for his blessing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So, many nations and powerful countries will look up to me in Jerusalem and ask for my blessing. 23Ten men from different languages will clutch one Jew's cloak and ask, "Can we go along? We've heard that God is with you."'"</span>
