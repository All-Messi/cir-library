## Esther Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> That night the king couldn't get to sleep, so he had them bring the record book and read it to him. 2The Chronicles wrote that Mordecai had reported about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, the doorkeepers that had tried to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The king asked, "What honor's been given to him for that?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The king said, "Who's in the court?" Haman had just come into the outer court of the king's palace to speak to him about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he'd built.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The king's aides said, "Haman's standing in the court."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Haman came in, the king asked him, "What should be done for a man the king wants to honor?" 8"Have them bring a royal robe you've worn, a horse you have ridden, and a royal crown that's been on your head. 9Hand the robe and the horse to one of your most noble princes and have them array him. Have them lead him on horseback through the city square and proclaim, 'This is what should be done for a man the king wants to honor.'"		Esther 6:6-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The king told Haman, "Hurry and take the robes and the horse like you said, and do that for Mordecai the Jew that's sitting at my gate. That's what I'll do for the man I want to honor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Haman took the robe and horse and arrayed Mordecai. He led him on horseback through the city square and proclaimed, "This is what's done for the man the king wants to honor." 12Then Mordecai went back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried home, mourning with his head covered. 13He told Zeresh and his friends what happened. His wise men and Zeresh said, "If Mordecai is a Jew that you've begun to fall in front of, you won't overcome him. You'll fall to him." 14While they were still talking, the king's eunuchs arrived and took him to the banquet Esther had prepared.		Esther 6:10-14</span>
