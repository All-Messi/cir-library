## Esther Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The king and Haman came to drink wine with Queen Esther. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The king asked her that second day as they drank their wine, 	<em>	</em><strong><em>“What’s your petition, Queen Esther; I’ll grant it. </em></strong> 	<strong><em>	What’s your request? Up to half the kingdom I’ll do it.”</em></strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> She answered, <em>“If I’</em><em>m pleasing to </em><em>you, my king, </em> <em>	</em><em>if it pleases </em><em>you</em><em>, </em> <em>have my life given to me as my petition, </em> <em>	</em><em>and my people as my request.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>My</em><em> people and I have been sold to be destroyed</em><em>, killed, </em><em>annihilated.</em><em> </em><em>If we’d only been sold as</em><em> male and female</em><em> slave</em><em>s</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>I would have kept quiet</em><em>; the trouble wouldn’t</em><em> com</em><em>pare</em><em> with the annoyance to the king.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> King Ahasuerus asked her, <em>“Who is he and where is he, that would presume to do </em><em>such a thing</em><em>?”</em> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> She said, <em>“A foe and enemy,</em><em> this wicked Haman!”</em> Haman panicked. 	      <strong>Esther 7:1-6</strong> 	<strong>Haman Hanged</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The king got up angry and went to the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther. He saw that the king had determined to harm him. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When the king came back, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. The king said, <em>“Will he even assault the queen with me in the </em><em>palac</em><em>e?”</em> As the word left his mouth, they covered Haman’s face. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Harbonah, one of the king’s eunuchs, said, <em>“</em><em>Look at the gallows by</em><em> Haman’s house </em><em>standing </em><em>75ft</em><em> high</em><em> that </em><em>he</em><em> made for Mordecai</em><em>,</em><em> who spoke good on behalf of the king!”</em> The king said, <em>“</em><em>Hang</em><em> him on it!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They hanged Haman on the gallows he’d built for Mordecai, and the king calmed down.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Esther 7:6-10</strong> 	<strong>Esther Saves the Jews</strong></span>
