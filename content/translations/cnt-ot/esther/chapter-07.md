## Esther Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The king and Haman came to drink wine with Queen Esther. 2The king asked her that second day as they drank their wine,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> She answered,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> My people and I have been sold to be destroyed, killed, annihilated. If we'd only been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet; the trouble wouldn't compare with the annoyance to the king."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> King Ahasuerus asked her, "Who is he and where is he, that would presume to do such a thing?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> She said, "A foe and enemy, this wicked Haman!" Haman panicked. 	      Esther 7:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The king got up angry and went to the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther. He saw that the king had determined to harm him. 8When the king came back, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. The king said, "Will he even assault the queen with me in the palace?" As the word left his mouth, they covered Haman's face. 9Harbonah, one of the king's eunuchs, said, "Look at the gallows by Haman's house standing 75ft high that he made for Mordecai, who spoke good on behalf of the king!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They hanged Haman on the gallows he'd built for Mordecai, and the king calmed down.		Esther 7:6-10</span>
