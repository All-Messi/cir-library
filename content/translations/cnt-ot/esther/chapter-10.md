## Esther Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> King Ahasuerus put under tribute the territory and lands by the Sea. 2His accomplishments by his authority and strength—as well as the full account of Mordecai's status that the king advanced him to—are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia. 3Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, great among the Jews, and favored by his host of relatives. He sought the good of his people and spoke for the welfare of his whole nation.	Esther 10:1-3</span>
