<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Its officials are roaring lions;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Its prophets are reckless, devious men;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD is good within it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I said, 'Surely, they'll respect me now</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then I'll purify the people's lips</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> From beyond the rivers in Nubia,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> At that time, you won't need to be ashamed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But among you I'll leave humble, common people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The ones remaining in Israel will do no wrong,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Shout for joy, Jerusalem!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD has canceled your condemnation</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The LORD your God is among you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> At that time, I'll deal with your oppressors,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then I'll bring you home,</span>
