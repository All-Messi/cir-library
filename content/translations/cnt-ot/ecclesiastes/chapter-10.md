## Ecclesiastes Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Dead flies even make perfume stink; likewise, a little foolishness can spoil wisdom and honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>A foolish heart pulls to the left; a wise one pulls to the right.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>You can recognize fools just by the way they walk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>If a ruler’s anger flares at you, don’t react, because composure smooths over big offenses.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 10:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>There’s a problem I’ve seen under the sun, an error that originates in rulers <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>who appoint foolish people to high positions while putting successful people in lower ones. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I’ve seen slaves ride horses beside princes that walk on the ground like slaves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>If you dig a pit, you may fall in it; if you break through a wall, you may get bit by a snake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>If you quarry stones, you may be injured by them; if you split logs, you may hurt yourself doing it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>If you don’t sharpen your axe, you have to work harder; wisdom aids success.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 10:5-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>If a snake bites before it’s charmed, the charmer hasn’t accomplished anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Words from the wise are gracious; the thoughts of fools destroy them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They begin with foolish talk, and <em>foolish talk</em> leads to foolish deeds;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>but fools just keep talking. Nobody knows what’s going to happen; who can tell people what will come after them?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Fools’ toil wears them out so much they can’t find their way home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Misfortune awaits the land whose king is a kid, whose princes feast in the morning.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>You’re a fortunate land if its king is noble and its princes eat at normal times— for energy, not for gluttony.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 10:11-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Through laziness, rafters sag; through idleness, the roof leaks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>People fix a meal for enjoyment; wine makes life happy; money solves everything;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Don’t curse the king in your bedroom or the rich where you sleep. A bird in the sky may hear what you say and spread it around.<strong>	</strong></span>
