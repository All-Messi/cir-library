## Ecclesiastes Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then I looked at the oppression that’s under the sun and saw the tears of the oppressed that have no comforters because their oppressors have the power. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So I decided the dead are better off than the living, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and the ones that never existed are better off yet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I saw that competition between people drives work and achievement. That's pointless too, like chasing the wind. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Fools fold their hands, so their bodies atrophy. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>One handful with quietness is better than two with toil—and chasing the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I saw something else that’s pointless under the sun: <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>people with nobody that needs them—offspring or sibling, yet they work as hard as they can to get wealth, but to no end because wealth doesn’t satisfy them: <em>“Who am I </em><em>work</em><em>ing for</em><em>? </em>Who am I<em> </em><em>depriving myself of </em><em>enjoyment</em><em> for?”</em><em> </em>It’s all meaningless and depressing.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 4:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Two are better than one because they can get more done. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>If either falls, the other can help; misfortune awaits whoever doesn’t have anybody that can help. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Besides, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; how can one keep warm alone? <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>A bully can overpower someone that’s alone, but two can resist. A cord with three strands doesn’t break easily.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A poor, wise youth is better off than a foolish old king who doesn’t know how to accept instruction anymore. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> youth </em>can come out of prison to become king, though he was born in poverty. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But I’ve seen people throng to the next young man to replace him, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and there’s no end to his successors. But people won’t be happy with those successors either. That whole scenario is pointless, too, like chasing the wind.<strong>           </strong><strong></span>
