## Ecclesiastes Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then I looked at the oppression that's under the sun and saw the tears of the oppressed that have no comforters because their oppressors have the power. 2So I decided the dead are better off than the living, 3and the ones that never existed are better off yet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I saw that competition between people drives work and achievement. That's pointless too, like chasing the wind. 5Fools fold their hands, so their bodies atrophy. 6One handful with quietness is better than two with toil—and chasing the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I saw something else that's pointless under the sun: 8people with nobody that needs them—offspring or sibling, yet they work as hard as they can to get wealth, but to no end because wealth doesn't satisfy them: "Who am I working for? Who am I depriving myself of enjoyment for?" It's all meaningless and depressing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Two are better than one because they can get more done. 10If either falls, the other can help; misfortune awaits whoever doesn't have anybody that can help. 11Besides, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; how can one keep warm alone? 12A bully can overpower someone that's alone, but two can resist. A cord with three strands doesn't break easily.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A poor, wise youth is better off than a foolish old king who doesn't know how to accept instruction anymore. 14A youth can come out of prison to become king, though he was born in poverty. 15But I've seen people throng to the next young man to replace him, 16and there's no end to his successors. But people won't be happy with those successors either. That whole scenario is pointless, too, like chasing the wind.</span>
