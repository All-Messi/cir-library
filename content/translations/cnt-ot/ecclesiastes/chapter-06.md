## Ecclesiastes Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There’s a common tragedy I’ve seen under the sun: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>people that God has given wealth and honor so they have everything they could want, but he hasn’t given them a chance to enjoy them; a foreigner is enjoying them. That’s a pointless tragedy. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>If a man fathers 100 children and lives for however many years, but isn’t satisfied with good things and doesn’t even get a proper burial, then I say, <em>“A miscarriage is better off </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>because</em><em> he</em><em> would have</em><em> come</em><em> in pointless and gone out in the dark</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> miscarriage never sees the sun or knows anything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Even</em><em> if </em><em>someone</em><em> lives </em><em>1,000</em><em> years twice and </em><em>isn’t content, what’s the point?</em><em> </em><em>E</em><em>verybody </em><em>ends up in</em><em> the same place</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> All our labor is for our mouth; yet our appetite isn’t satisfied. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>What advantage do the wise have over the foolish? What advantage do the poor have that know how to conduct themselves with other people? <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>What the eyes see is better than what the soul wants. That’s pointless too, like chasing the wind.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 6:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>God</em> has already decided what’s going to happen, including what each of us will be. We can’t argue with him about it; he’s stronger than we are. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The more we say the less it means; so what’s the point of talking? <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Who knows what’s good for us anyway during the few years of our pointless life? They’ll go by like a shadow, and who can tell us what will happen under the sun when they’re done?</span>
