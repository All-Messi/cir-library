## Ecclesiastes Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Remember your Creator when you're young,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Besides being a wise man, the Preacher taught the people. He weighed, studied, and classified lots of proverbs. 10He endeavored to write true things and searched for expressive words.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The words of the wise are like goads. Collections of them are like nails tightly driven; they come from one Shepherd. 12My child, beware of anything more: there's no end to writing books, and too much study wears you out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You've heard every view. Here's the conclusion: respect God and do his will; that's your role. 14God will judge every act, everything secret, good or bad.</span>
