## Ecclesiastes Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A good reputation is better than expensive ointment; the day you die is better than the day you’re born.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It’s better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting; because that’s the end of everyone, and the living should take it to heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Sorrow is better than laughter in this respect: when the face is sad, the heart can be happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The heart of the wise remembers there’s mourning, but the heart of a fool just thinks about having fun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It’s better to listen to a rebuke from the wise than be regaled by the songs of a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A fool’s laughter doesn’t last long; it’s like thorns crackling under a <em>heating </em>pot: it’s pointless.<strong>	</strong><strong>Eccl 7:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Oppression can turn the wise into fools; bribes corrupt their heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Finishing is better than starting; patience is better than pride.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don’t get mad quick, because anger thrives in the chest of fools.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Don’t say, <em>“Why were the old days better than now?”</em> You don’t ask that because you’re wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Wisdom plus inheritance is good; it’s an advantage to those who see the sun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Protecting knowledge is like protecting money, but only knowledge can save your life.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 7:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Think about what God does; who can straighten out what he bends?<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Be happy in prosperous times, but in hard times think about <em>this</em>: God has made the one as well as the other; so you can’t be sure what will happen when you’re gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I’ve seen all kinds of things in my pointless life, including good people that die young and bad people that die old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Don’t overestimate your “goodness” or “wisdom.” Why ruin what you really are?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don’t be excessively bad or foolish. Why die early? <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Avoid extremes. A <em>humble </em>person that respects God ends up with both <em>wise goodness</em><em> and long life</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> One wise person is stronger than ten rulers in a city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Nobody’s <em>always</em> good; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>so don’t take too seriously everything you hear; you may hear your servant cursing you, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and you know how often <u>you</u>’ve cursed people.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 7:13-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I determined I’d be wise about everything, but I couldn’t do it. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>No one can figure out what’s distant and deep. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>I set my mind to knowing, investigating, looking for wisdom and explanation, to identifying sinfulness, foolishness, and folly. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>I discovered more bitter than death is a woman whose heart is a snare, whose hands are chains.</span>
