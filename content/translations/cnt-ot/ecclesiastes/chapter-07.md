## Ecclesiastes Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A good reputation is better than expensive ointment;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It's better to go to a house of mourning</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Sorrow is better than laughter in this respect:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It's better to listen to a rebuke from the wise</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A fool's laughter doesn't last long;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Oppression can turn the wise into fools;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Finishing is better than starting;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don't get mad quick,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Don't say, "Why were the old days better than now?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> One wise person is stronger than ten rulers in a city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Nobody's always good; 21so don't take too seriously everything you hear; you may hear your servant cursing you, 22and you know how often you've cursed people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I determined I'd be wise about everything, but I couldn't do it. 24No one can figure out what's distant and deep. 25I set my mind to knowing, investigating, looking for wisdom and explanation, to identifying sinfulness, foolishness, and folly. 26I discovered more bitter than death is a woman whose heart is a snare, whose hands are chains. 27"Here's something I've discovered," the Preacher says, "combining one thing with another to reach a conclusion, 28something I'm still looking for and haven't found. I've found a man among a thousand, but I haven't found a woman among them. 29I've found only this: God made people godly, but they've sought out their own ways."</span>
