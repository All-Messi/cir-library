## Ecclesiastes Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There’s a time for everything under the sky:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> a time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot what’s planted;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to build and a time to tear down;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> a time to laugh and a time to cry; a time to dance and a time to mourn;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> a time to gather stones and a time to throw them away; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> a time to search and a time to quit searching; a time to keep and a time to throw away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> a time to rip apart and a time to sew together; a time to speak and a time to be quiet;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> a time to love and a time not to love; a time for peace and a time for war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What do workers get out of work? <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I’ve seen the job God has given people to occupy themselves. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He’s set an appropriate time for everything and planted eternity in their hearts, but in a way that they can’t see his work beginning to end.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 3:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I realize there’s nothing better for people than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>There’s nothing better than eating and drinking and taking pleasure in their work—that’s God’s gift. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Everything God does is final. There’s nothing to add or take away, because he has worked in such a way that people should respect him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>What will be has already been, because God does again what he’s done before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Besides, I’ve seen that in place of justice and goodness there’s wickedness under the sun. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>I said to myself, <em>	</em><em>“</em><em>God will judge the good </em><em>and </em><em>the bad</em><em> because he’s appointed a time for everything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> tests them</em><em> so they can see they’re </em><em>no better than </em><em>animals.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> People and animals have the same fate: one dies like the other; they both have to breathe. People don’t have any advantage. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>They both came from dust, and they’ll go back to it. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Who knows if a person’s spirit goes up and an animal’s spirit goes down into the ground? <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>I’ve seen that there’s nothing better for people than to be happy in what they do; that’s their lot. Who can make them see what’ll happen when they’re gone?<strong></span>
