## Job Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bildad the Shuhite answered:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Does God pervert justice?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When your children sinned against him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> If you look for God and beg for mercy from the Almighty,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Though you started with little,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Won't they teach you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> While they're still growing and not ready to be cut,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The paths of everyone that forgets God are like that;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> What they depend on breaks down;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They trust it, but it doesn't hold firm;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It's like a lush plant that thrives in the sunshine</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But if it's pulled loose,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> That's the extent of its 'joy';</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yet he'll fill your mouth with laughter,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> In the end, those who hate you he'll cover with disgrace;</span>
