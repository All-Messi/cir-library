<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You keep your eyes open at them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who can make unclean into clean?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Since their days are set,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Turn your gaze away so they can relax</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Though its roots grow old in the ground</span>
