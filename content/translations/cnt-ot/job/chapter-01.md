## Job Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job lived in the land of Uz, <strong>a blameless, </strong><strong>godly</strong><strong> </strong><strong>man </strong><strong>that </strong><strong>respect</strong><strong>ed God and </strong><strong>shunned</strong><strong> evil</strong>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He had seven sons and three daughters; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys; and servants. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His sons would hold feasts in each other’s houses and invite their three sisters. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When the feasting days had completed their cycle, Job would consecrate them, getting up early and offering burnt offerings for each one, <em>“Maybe my </em><em>children</em><em> have sinned and cursed Go</em><em>d in</em><em> their hearts.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> One day when the sons of God came to present themselves to the LORD, Satan came too. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The LORD asked him, <em>“Where’d </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> come from?”</em><em> </em> <em>“From roaming </em><em>around </em><em>in the world.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> One day when his sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother’s house, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>a messenger came to Job, <em>“The oxen were plowing</em><em>,</em><em> the donkeys were feeding alongside them, </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>and the Sabeans attacked and stole them.</em><em> </em><em>They killed the servants with the sword</em><em>. </em><strong><em>I’m the only one that escaped to tell you</em></strong><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>While he was still talking, another servant came, <em>“God’s fire fell from </em><em>the sky</em><em> and burned up the sheep and the servants</em><em>. </em><strong><em>I’m the only one that escaped to tell you</em></strong><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>While he was still talking, another servant came, <em>“The Chaldeans formed three bands</em><em>, and raided the camels, stole</em><em> them</em><em>,</em><em> and killed the servant</em><em>s</em><em> with the sword.</em><em> </em><strong><em>I’m the only one that escaped to tell you</em></strong><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>While he was still talking, another servant came, <em>“Your sons and daughters were </em><em>drinking wine and </em><em>eating </em><em>in their oldest brother’s house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> </em><em>violent</em><em> </em><em>gale</em><em> from the </em><em>desert</em><em> </em><em>demolished </em><em>the house.</em><em> It collapsed</em><em> on the young people and </em><em>killed them</em><strong><em>. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.</em></strong><em>”</em><strong>	                                                                        </strong><strong>Job 1:13-19         </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; he fell on the ground and worshiped, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em> “I came naked from my mother’s womb, </em> <em>	</em><em>	a</em><em>nd I’ll </em><em>leave</em><em> naked.</em> <em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> gave and the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>has taken away.</em> <em>	</em><em>Bless the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Through all that, Job didn’t sin by blaming God.<strong>                                  </strong><strong>	    </strong><strong>Job 1:20-22</strong><strong>        </strong></span>
