## Job Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> If you wanted to dispute with him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He's so wise and powerful;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He can shake the earth and make its pillars tremble;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He alone stretched out the sky</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He made the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He does great, unimaginable things,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He snatches away; who can stop him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> God won't turn away his anger;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Even if I were innocent, I couldn't answer him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> If I called and he answered me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He attacks me with a storm</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He won't let me catch my breath,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> If it's a matter of power, look at him!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Though I'm good, my mouth will condemn me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Innocent and guilty are the same to him; so I say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> When disaster brings sudden death,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The earth has been turned over to sinners;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They slip by like a reed skiff,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> If I say, 'I'll forget about my complaint;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I'm afraid of my sufferings;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He'll condemn me anyway;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Even if I wash myself with snow</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> There's no mediator between us</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Then I'd speak without fearing him,</span>
