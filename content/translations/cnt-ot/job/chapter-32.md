## Job Chapter **32**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The three men stopped replying to Job, because he was certain he was innocent. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram, was mad at Job because he’d justified himself to God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He was mad at his three friends because they couldn’t answer <em>Job</em> but still condemned him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Elihu had waited to speak because they were years older than he was. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When he saw they didn’t provide an answer, his anger burned inside him. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So he spoke up: <em>“I’m young and you’re old;</em> <em>	</em><em>	so I’ve been reluctant to tell you what I believed. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I thought age should speak</em> <em>	</em><em>	because wisdom should come with age.</em><em>	</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>But it’s the spirit in a person</em> <em>	</em><em>	and the breath of the Almighty that give insight.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Abundant years may not bring wisdom;</em> <em>	</em><em>	elders may not understand what’s just.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>So listen and I’ll say what I think too.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Job 32:1-10</p>

### 11“I waited for your words; 		I listened to your reasoning 			while you thought about what to say.


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>I paid careful attention;</em> <em>	</em><em>	none of you refuted Job</em> <em>	</em><em>	or answered his arguments.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Don’t say, ‘We’ve found him too wise for us;</em> <em>	</em><em>	God alone will have to refute him, not mortals.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Job hasn’t been arguing with me;</em> <em>	</em><em>	but I wouldn’t have answered him with your arguments.</em><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Job 32:11-14</p>

### 15“You’re discredited; 		you don’t have anything else to say.


<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Should I keep waiting </em> <em>	</em><em>	when you’re not speaking anymore?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I’ll give my answer too</em> <em>	</em><em>	and express my opinion.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I have so many things I want to say;</em> <em>	</em><em>	my spirit constrains me to speak.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>My stomach is like an unvented wine cask;</em> <em>	</em><em>	it’s about to burst like a new wineskin.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>I have to say something so I can get relief;</em> <em>	</em><em>	let me answer. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>I won’t show partiality to anybody</em> <em>	</em><em>	or flatter anyone.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>I don’t know how to flatter;</em> <em>	</em><em>	otherwise, my Maker would put an end to me.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
