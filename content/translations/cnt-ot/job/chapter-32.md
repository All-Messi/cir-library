## Job Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The three men stopped replying to Job, because he was certain he was innocent. 2Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram, was mad at Job because he'd justified himself to God. 3He was mad at his three friends because they couldn't answer Job but still condemned him. 4Elihu had waited to speak because they were years older than he was. 5When he saw they didn't provide an answer, his anger burned inside him. 6So he spoke up:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I thought age should speak</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But it's the spirit in a person</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Abundant years may not bring wisdom;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So listen and I'll say what I think too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I paid careful attention;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Don't say, 'We've found him too wise for us;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Job hasn't been arguing with me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Should I keep waiting</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll give my answer too</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I have so many things I want to say;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My stomach is like an unvented wine cask;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I have to say something so I can get relief;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I won't show partiality to anybody</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I don't know how to flatter;</span>
