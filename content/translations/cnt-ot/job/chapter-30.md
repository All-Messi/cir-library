## Job Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But now people younger than me make fun of me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> What good was their strength to me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They were haggard from hunger and want</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They picked wild greens from among the bushes</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> People drove them away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So they lived in ravines, caves, and rocks;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A senseless, unnamed bunch,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They're appalled at me and shrink back;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Because God has removed my bowstring and cast me down,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> This rabble opposes me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They tear up my road and profit from my misfortune;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They come at me as if through a wide breach;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They terrorize me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> At night my bones ache,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> My clothes are tattered from violence;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I call out to you, but you don't answer;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You've become cruel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You pick me up and blow me around in the wind;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I know you're going to bring me to death,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Haven't I cried for people whose life is hard?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When I expected good, evil came;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I'm in turmoil inside; I can't relax;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I go around mourning without comfort;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> I've become a brother to jackals,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> My skin is ashen,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> My harp plays music for mourning;</span>
