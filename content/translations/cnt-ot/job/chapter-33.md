## Job Chapter 33

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But now, Job, listen to what I have to say;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'm opening my mouth now;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> What I'm saying expresses my uprightness;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The Spirit of God has made me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Answer me if you can;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I belong to God like you do;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I shouldn't be a threat to you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He invents pretexts against me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He puts my feet in stocks</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Why do you complain</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> God speaks in one way, maybe two;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then he opens their ears and warns them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He holds them back from the Pit</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Their bodies waste away,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then they draw near the Pit;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Let their bodies become fresh with youth</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then they'll pray to God, and he'll accept them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They'll sing to other people and say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> He's rescued me from the Pit,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Pay attention, Job; listen;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Then if you have anything to say, you can answer me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> If not, listen, and I'll teach you wisdom."</span>
