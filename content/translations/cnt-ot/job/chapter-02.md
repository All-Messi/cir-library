## Job Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On another day when the sons of God came to present themselves to the LORD, Satan came with them. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The LORD asked him, <em>“Where’d</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> come from?” </em> <em>“From roaming </em><em>around </em><em>in the world.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Satan went out from the LORD and struck Job with sore boils from the top of his head to the sole of his feet. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He was using a potsherd to scrape himself, sitting in ashes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> His wife said,<em> “Do you still </em><em>maintain</em><em> your integrity?</em><em> </em><em>Curse God and die!”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But he told her,<em> “You </em><em>talk</em><em> like </em><em>a foolish woma</em><em>n.</em><em> </em><em>Will we accept good from God and not adversity?”</em> In all that, Job didn’t sin in what he said.<strong>	</strong><strong>Job 2:1-10</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite heard about all the terrible things that had happened to him. They made an appointment together to come and sympathize with him and comfort him. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When they looked up from a distance and didn’t recognize him, they wailed loudly, tore their robes, and threw dust over their heads. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They sat down on the ground with him for seven days and nights without saying a word, because they saw he was in so much pain.<strong>	  </strong><strong>Job 2:11-13</strong></span>
