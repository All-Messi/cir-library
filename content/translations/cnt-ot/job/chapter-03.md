<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Let darkness and gloom claim it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Let darkness seize that night;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Let that night be barren,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Let them curse it who curse the daytime,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Let its morning stars be blacked out;</span>
