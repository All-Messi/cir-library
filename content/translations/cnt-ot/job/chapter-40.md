<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD said to Job,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Job said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I've spoken once or twice; that's enough;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD answered him out of the storm:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Will you really try to discredit me to justify yourself?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Do you have an arm like mine?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Pour out your overflowing anger;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Look down on everybody that's arrogant;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Bury them in the dust together;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then I'll acknowledge to you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It has strong loins</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> It swings its tail like a cedar beam;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Its bones are like bronze tubes;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> It's a prime example of my what I've created;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The mountains produce its food,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> It lies down under the lotus plants</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The lotus plants give it shade;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> It doesn't care if the river rages</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Can anyone capture it when it's awake?</span>
