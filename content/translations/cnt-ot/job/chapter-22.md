## Job Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Eliphaz the Temanite answered:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Is the Almighty delighted if you're good?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Surely it's not because you revere him that he's reproving you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Isn't it more likely that you're sinful,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Maybe you've exacted pledges from your friends</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Maybe you've withheld water from the fainting</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Maybe you think the land belongs to the powerful,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Maybe you've sent widows away with nothing</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So, there are traps everywhere around you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Your light's so dim you can't see,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But you say, 'So how can he see what I'm doing?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Dark clouds wrap around him so he can't see;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Will you stay on the ancient way</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They tell God, 'Get away!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yet he's filled their houses with good things—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Good people are glad to see the wicked get destroyed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Accept his instruction;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> If you come back to the Almighty, he'll restore you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then you'll delight in the Almighty</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You'll pray to him, and he'll hear you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When you decide something, it'll happen;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When people put you down, you'll still be confident</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> He delivers innocent people;</span>
