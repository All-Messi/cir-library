<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Like a slave panting for shade,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I've been allotted months of emptiness</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When I'm in bed, I say, 'When is morning ever going to get here?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My body is covered with maggots and scabs;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> My days fly by faster than a weaver's shuttle</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> People won't see me for long</span>
