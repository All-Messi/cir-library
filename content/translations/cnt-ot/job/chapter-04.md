## Job Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Eliphaz the Temanite answered:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You've admonished many people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> What you've said has helped the tottering stand</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But now difficulty has come to you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Isn't your reverence for God your confidence,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In my experience, those who plow sin</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They perish by God's breath;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A lion roars; it can roar loud;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> A lion perishes because there's no prey,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In my dreams at night when deep sleep comes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A spirit glided by my face</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It stood still,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> God doesn't trust his own servants;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> In one day they're broken to pieces;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Isn't their tent-rope pulled up inside them?</span>
