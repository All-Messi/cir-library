## Haggai Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The First Day, Sixth Month, Second Year of King Darius 2"The LORD says, 'These people are saying this is no time to be rebuilding the LORD's Temple.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A message came by Haggai, 4"Is this a time for you to be living in your paneled houses while my Temple lies in ruins?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You sow a lot, but reap a little; 8"Go up into the mountains to get lumber; rebuild the Temple so I can be pleased with it and honored by it. 9You look for a good crop, but it comes in poor. When you haul it in, I blow it away. Why? Because my Temple is lying in ruins while your interest lies in your own houses. 10So the sky hasn't dropped dew, and the ground hasn't produced crops. 11I called for a drought on the fields and hills: the grain, new wine, and olive oil—on what the ground grows; on you, your livestock, and your efforts."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So Zerubbabel, Joshua/Jeshua, and the remnant obeyed Haggai because the LORD had sent him, and the people respected the LORD. 13Then Haggai said by God's commission, "'I'm with you,' the LORD says." 14So the LORD stirred up Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant to begin work on the Temple 15the twenty-fourth day, sixth month, second year of Darius.</span>
