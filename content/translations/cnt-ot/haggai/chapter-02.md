## Haggai Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Twenty-First Day, Seventh Month 2"Ask Zerubbabel, Joshua/Jeshua the high priest, and the remnant, 3'How many of you saw this Temple in its former beauty? How does it look to you now? Doesn't it seem like nothing in comparison? 4But resolve to work because I'm with you. 5Like I promised when you came out of Egypt, my Spirit's among you so you needn't be afraid!' 6"Soon I'm going to shake earth and sky one more time, ocean and dry land, 7as well as the nations. Pilgrims will bring wealth from every country to fill this Temple with beauty. 8Silver and gold belong to me. 9This Temple's beauty will be greater than the former, and there'll be peace here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The Twenty-Fourth Day, Ninth Month, Second Year of Darius 11"Ask the priests for a ruling: 12'if someone carries consecrated meat folded up in his cloak and that fold touches bread, cooked food, wine, olive oil, and the like, does the other food become consecrated?'" 13"If somebody that's ceremonially unclean from a corpse, touches any of these, will they become unclean?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then Haggai said, "That's the way it is with this nation. Everything you do and everything you offer is unclean. 15Think about what was happening before you began to place one stone on another in the LORD's Temple: 16f you went to a grain pile to get 20 measures, there'd only be 10 left; if you went to a wine vat to draw 50 measures, there'd only be 20 left. 17You and everything you did, I struck with blasting wind, mildew, and hail; but you didn't come back to me. 18-19But notice this: The seed is still in the granary; the grapevines, fig trees, pomegranates, and olive trees have not started to bear—but from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month on, when you've begun laying the foundation for the Temple—I'll be blessing you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The Same Day: Twenty-Fourth Day of the Month 21"Tell Zerubbabel, 'I'm going to shake earth and sky, 22overthrow the thrones of kingdoms, destroy powerful nations, defeat chariots and riders; every horse and rider will fall by the sword. 23Then I'll make you my signet ring because I've chosen you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel.'</span>
