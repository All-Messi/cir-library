## Joshua Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When they'd crossed, the LORD told Joshua, 2"Appoint a man from each tribe 3to take a rock from the Jordan, carry it over, and lay it down where they'll spend the night."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Joshua called the twelve men, 5"Go on past the Ark to the middle of the Jordan and pick up a rock onto your shoulder. 6They'll be a sign when your children ask what these rocks mean. 7Tell them the Jordan River held back ahead of the Ark as it crossed. These rocks serve as a permanent memorial for Israelites."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They picked up 12 rocks out of the Jordan, carried them over to where they would spend the night, and laid them down. 9Then Joshua set up 12 rocks in the Jordan where the priests had stood. They're still there. 10The priests stood in the Jordan till everything happened that the LORD had Joshua tell the people. 	Josh 4:1-10a The people crossed in a hurry. 11Then the priests and the Ark went on over. 12Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe also went over to the plains by Jericho—13about 40,000. 14That day the LORD elevated Joshua in Israel. They stood in awe of him all his life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD said to Joshua, 16"Tell the priests that are carrying the Ark to come up out of the Jordan." [17] 18When they'd come up, the water went back to overflowing its banks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day, first month, and camped at Gilgal east of Jericho. 20Joshua set up the 12 stones from the Jordan at Gilgal 21and told the people, "When your descendants ask what these stones mean, 22tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry riverbed. 23The LORD our God dried up the water till we crossed it like he did at the Red Sea.' 24Everybody in the world will know the LORD is powerful, and you'll respect him forever."	Josh 4:10b-24</span>
