## Joshua Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Judah's allotment by clans reached the border of Edom, went south to the Wilderness of Zin at the farthest. 2Their south border went from the lower end of the Dead Sea, from the bay that turns south. 3It went on south to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up south of Kadesh-barnea, continued to Hezron, up to Addar, and turned to Karka. 4It went on to Azmon and the River of Egypt and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. That was their south border.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The east border was the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan. 	Josh 15:1-5a The north border went from the mouth of the Jordan, 6 up to Beth-hoglah, continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and up to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 7The border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, turned north toward Gilgal, which is across from the ascent of Adummim, on the south of the valley. It continued to En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 8Then the border went up the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (Jerusalem). It went on up to the top of the mountain that lies across from the Valley of Hinnom to the west, at the northern end of the Valley Rephaim. 9From the top of the mountain, the border curved to the spring of Nephtoah, went on to the towns of Mount Ephron, and curved to Baalah (Kiriath-jearim). 10It turned west from Baalah to Mount Seir, continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (Chesalon), went down to Beth-shemesh, and continued through Timnah. 11The border proceeded to the north side of Ekron, curved to Shikkeron and to Mount Baalah and Jabneel, and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The west border was the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. 	Josh 15:5b-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> By the LORD's command, Joshua gave Caleb a territory among the descendants of Judah: Kiriath-arba (Hebron). 14Caleb drove out Anak's three sons: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 15He went up from there against Debir (formerly Kiriath-sepher). 16Caleb said, "Whoever takes Kiriath-sepher, I'll give Achsah my daughter as a wife." 17Othniel, son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, took it; so Caleb gave her to him as a wife. 18When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked her what she wanted. 19"Give me another endowment. Since you've put me in the Negev, give me springs too." He gave her the upper and lower springs.</span>
