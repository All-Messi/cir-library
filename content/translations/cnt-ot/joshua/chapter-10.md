## Joshua Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had taken Ai and destroyed it like Jericho and its king. <em>He heard</em> how Gibeon had made peace with Israel and was among them. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He was really afraid because Gibeon was a big city, like a royal city. It was bigger than Ai and its men were strong. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So he sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>H</em><em>elp me attack Gibeon</em><em>; </em><em>it has</em><em> made peace with </em><em>Israel.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Those five allied forces camped against Gibeon and attacked it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The men in Gibeon sent to Joshua at camp in Gilgal, <em>“</em><em>Don’</em><em>t relax your </em><em>grip</em><em> </em><em>on </em><em>us</em><em>.</em><em> Come </em><em>qui</em><em>ck and save us! T</em><em>he </em><em>Amorite </em><em>kings </em><em>from </em><em>the hill country</em><em> hav</em><em>e </em><em>formed an alliance</em><em> against us.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So Joshua and the fighting men went up from Gilgal. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The LORD told Joshua, <em>“Don’t be afraid of them. I’ll deliver</em><em> them to you.</em><em> </em><em>Not a man will stand against you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He marched up all night and attacked them by surprise. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The LORD threw them into panic, and Israel killed them with a great slaughter. They chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>As they fled down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD sent big hailstones on them all the way to Azekah. More died from hailstones than Israel killed with the sword. <strong>	</strong><strong>Josh 10:1-11</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then in front of Israel, Joshua spoke to the LORD the day he gave the Amorites to Israel, <em>“Have the sun stand still at Gibeon</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and the moon over the V</em><em>alley of Aijalon.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So the sun stood still, and the moon stayed till the nation took revenge on its enemies. It’s recorded in <em>The Book of Jashar.</em><em> </em>The sun stood still at midday and didn’t go down for about a day. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>There wasn’t a day like it before or since when the LORD listened to <em>such an extreme request by </em>someone, because he fought for Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Joshua and Israel came back to camp at Gilgal. <strong>Five Amorite Kings Executed</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The five kings fled and hid in the cave at Makkedah. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>People</em> told Joshua where they were hiding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He said, <em>“</em><em>Roll large </em><em>rock</em><em>s against the mouth of the cave</em><em> and post a guard.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>D</em><em>on’t stay there.</em><em> </em><em>Chase </em><em>your enemies and fall on them. D</em><em>on’t let them </em><em>get into their towns. The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God will</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> them to you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Joshua and the Israelites killed them with a great slaughter till they wiped them out, but some stragglers got back into the fortified towns. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The people came back safe to Joshua at Makkedah. Nobody said a word against Israel.<strong>	</strong><strong>Josh 10:12-21</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then Joshua told them to open the cave and bring out the five kings<em>.</em> [<strong><sup>23</sup></strong>]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He told the commanders and fighting men, <em>“</em><em>P</em><em>ut your feet on the</em><em>ir</em><em> necks.</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Don’t be afraid or intimidated; be strong and courageous. T</em><em>his is what the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will do to all the enemies you fight.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He struck them and put them to death and hung them on five trees. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>At sundown he had <em>the men</em> take them down, throw them back into the cave, and put large rocks against its mouth. They’re still there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That day Joshua struck down everybody in <u>Makkedah</u> with the sword and did to its king what he’d done to Jericho’s king.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Southern Towns Conquered


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He and Israel passed on from Makkedah and attacked <u>Libnah</u>. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>The LORD gave it and its king to Israel. He struck everybody in it with the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Next, Joshua lay siege to <u>Lachish</u>, <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>and the LORD gave it to Israel. He took it on the second day and struck everybody in it with the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then Horam, king of <u>Gezer</u>, came to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people till there weren’t any left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> He passed on from Lachish, laid siege to <u>Eglon</u>, and attacked it. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>They took it that day, struck it with the sword, and destroyed everyone in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Joshua went up from Eglon to attack <u>Hebron</u>. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>He struck it, its king, and surrounding villages with the sword and destroyed everybody in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then he turned back and attacked <u>Debir</u>. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>He struck it, its king, and surrounding villages with the sword and destroyed everybody in them. So he did to Debir what he’d done to Hebron, Libnah, and their kings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Joshua defeated the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills, the slopes, and their kings. He destroyed everybody that breathed—like the LORD commanded. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He defeated them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, the whole country of Goshen as far as Gibeon. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>He took those kings and their land in one campaign because the LORD God of Israel fought for them. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>Then he and Israel went back to camp at Gilgal.<strong>	</strong><strong>Josh 10:29-43</strong> <strong>Northern Kings Defeated</strong></span>
