<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> When they finished dividing up the land, the Israelites gave Joshua an inheritance. 50In accordance with the LORD's command, they gave him the city he asked for, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the city and settled in it. 51Those are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the heads of households distributed by lot in Shiloh in front of the LORD, at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing up the land.</span>
