## Joshua Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The allotment for Joseph's descendants goes from the Jordan by Jericho to the open country to the hill country of Bethel. 2Then it goes from Bethel to Luz and passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites. 3Then it runs west to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the area around Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. 4Joseph's people—Manasseh and Ephraim—received their inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> This is the territory of Ephraim by clans. The boundary on the east is Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon 6and from there to the Mediterranean Sea. Michmethath is on the north. The boundary turns east toward Taanath-shiloh and continues east to Janoah. 7Then it goes down to Ataroth and Naarah, touches Jericho, and ends at the Jordan. 8From Tappuah the boundary goes west to Brook Kanah and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. That's the inheritance for the Ephraimites by clans, 9together with their towns and villages that were set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites. 10But they didn't drive out the Canaanites in Gezer. They still live among the Ephraimites, doing forced labor.</span>
