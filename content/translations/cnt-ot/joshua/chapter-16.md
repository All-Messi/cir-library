## Joshua Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The allotment for Joseph’s descendants goes from the Jordan by Jericho to the open country to the hill country of Bethel. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then it goes from Bethel to Luz and passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then it runs west to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the area around Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and ends at the Mediterranean<em> </em>Sea. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Joseph’s people—<strong>Manasseh </strong>and<strong> Ephraim</strong>—received their inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> This is the territory of <strong>Ephraim</strong> by clans. The boundary on the east is Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and from there to the Mediterranean<em> </em>Sea. Michmethath is on the north. The boundary turns east toward Taanath-shiloh and continues east to Janoah. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then it goes down to Ataroth and Naarah, touches Jericho, and ends at the Jordan. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>From Tappuah the boundary goes west to Brook Kanah and ends at the Mediterranean<em> </em>Sea. That’s the inheritance for the Ephraimites by clans, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>together with their towns and villages that were set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But they didn’t drive out the Canaanites in Gezer. They still live among the Ephraimites, doing forced labor.</span>
