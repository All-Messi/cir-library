## Joshua Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Joshua called Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh<em> </em>half-tribe,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Joshua blessed them and sent them home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> To the one Manasseh<em> </em>half-tribe, Moses had given a possession in Bashan. To the other half, Joshua had given a possession beside them west of the Jordan. When Joshua sent them home, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>he said, <em>“Go with your considerable wealth</em><em> in livestock</em><em>, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and clothing.</em><em> </em><em>Divide the spoil from your enemies with your </em><em>relatives</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe<em> </em>separated from Israel at Shiloh in Canaan and went to Gilead.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 22:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When they came to the region around the Jordan (which lies in Canaan), Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe built a large altar by the Jordan. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>People in Israel heard that Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe had built an altar at the frontier with Canaan near the Jordan on Israel’s side. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When they heard about it, they gathered at Shiloh to fight them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Israel sent them Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and one family head from each tribe. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe<em> </em>answered,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Phinehas and the heads of the community liked what they heard. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“</em><em>Now</em><em> we know the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is among us</em><em>. You haven’t committed </em><em>tre</em><em>achery. You’</em><em>ve saved Israel from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They left and took word back to Israel in Canaan. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The report pleased them, and they blessed God and didn’t say anything more about fighting. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Reuben and Gad called the altar Ed,<em> </em><em>a ‘</em><em>witness</em><em>’</em><em> </em>that the LORD is God.<em>	</em><strong>Josh 22:30-34</strong> <strong>Joshua’s Farewell</strong></span>
