## Joshua Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Joshua called Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe, 2"You've done everything Moses and I have commanded you. 3You haven't abandoned your fellow Jews. You've kept the LORD's charge, 4and he's given them peace. Go to your possession beyond the Jordan. 5Observe the Law Moses commanded you: love the LORD your God, follow his ways, hold onto him, and serve him with all your heart and soul."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Joshua blessed them and sent them home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> To the one Manasseh half-tribe, Moses had given a possession in Bashan. To the other half, Joshua had given a possession beside them west of the Jordan. When Joshua sent them home, 8he said, "Go with your considerable wealth in livestock, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and clothing. Divide the spoil from your enemies with your relatives." 9Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe separated from Israel at Shiloh in Canaan and went to Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When they came to the region around the Jordan (which lies in Canaan), Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe built a large altar by the Jordan. 11People in Israel heard that Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe had built an altar at the frontier with Canaan near the Jordan on Israel's side. 12When they heard about it, they gathered at Shiloh to fight them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Israel sent them Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest 14and one family head from each tribe. 15They said, 16"The whole community says, 'What's this treachery you've committed against the LORD God of Israel by building yourselves an altar in rebellion against him? 17Didn't we have enough sin at Peor that we haven't yet cleansed ourselves from? Because of it a plague came on the community. 18If you rebel against him today, he'll be angry with the whole community tomorrow. 19If your land is ceremonially unclean, pass over to where his Tabernacle stands. Take a possession among us. Just don't rebel against the LORD or make us rebels by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD. 20Didn't Achan son of Zerah break faith with the devoted things, and wrath fell on the whole community? He didn't perish alone in his sin.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe answered, 22"The Mighty One, God the LORD! The Mighty One, God the LORD! He knows, and let Israel know! If it's rebellion or unfaithfulness toward him, don't spare us. 23If we did it to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, or peace offerings, may he take revenge. 24No! We did so that later on your descendants couldn't say to ours, 'What do you have to do with the LORD God of Israel? 25He has made the Jordan a boundary between us. You don't have any territory in him.' Your descendants might make ours stop worshiping the LORD. 26So we said we'd build an altar now, not for sacrifice, 27but to testify that we and our descendants do serve the LORD with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings. We did it for fear that your descendants might tell ours they didn't have any territory in the LORD. 28Then we could say, 'Look at the copy of his altar our ancestors built for a witness between us.' 29We're certainly not rebelling against him by building an altar to replace the one in front of his Tabernacle!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Phinehas and the heads of the community liked what they heard. 31He told them, "Now we know the LORD is among us. You haven't committed treachery. You've saved Israel from the LORD." 32They left and took word back to Israel in Canaan. 33The report pleased them, and they blessed God and didn't say anything more about fighting. 34Reuben and Gad called the altar Ed, a 'witness' that the LORD is God.</span>
