## Joshua Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Joshua gathered the tribes to Shechem with their elders, heads, judges, and officers. They presented themselves to God. 2Joshua said, "The LORD God of Israel, says, 'Your ancestors lived beyond the Euphrates River. Nahor and Terah, Abraham's father, served other gods. 3I led Abraham from there all over Canaan and multiplied his offspring. I gave him Isaac, 4and gave Isaac Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Seir, but Jacob and his descendants went down to Egypt. 5I sent Moses and Aaron, and plagued Egypt in its own land. 6Afterwards I brought you out of there. You came to the Red Sea, and the Egyptians chased you with chariots and cavalry to the sea. 7When you cried out to me, I put darkness between you and them, and made the sea cover them. You saw that and lived a long time in the desert. 8Then I brought you to Amorite country east of the Jordan. They fought you, and I destroyed them in front of you. You took their land. 9Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, rose up to oppose you. He sent for Balaam son of Beor and invited him to curse you. 10But I wouldn't listen to Balaam. So he blessed you, and I delivered you from him. 11You crossed the Jordan to Jericho, and the people in Jericho fought you as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites. I gave them to you. 12I sent hornets to drive out the two Amorite kings. Your sword and bow didn't do it. 13I gave you a land you hadn't worked and towns you didn't build, and you lived in them. You're eating the fruit from vineyards and olive orchards you didn't plant.' 14"Now then, respect the LORD, serve him sincerely and faithfully. Put away the gods your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt. 15If you won't serve him, choose today who you will serve: the gods of your ancestors beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites where you're living. My house and I will serve the LORD."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The people answered, "We'll never leave the LORD and serve other gods. 17He's the one that brought us and our ancestors out of slavery in Egypt. He did those great signs for us and preserved us all the way among the nations we passed through. 18He drove the Amorites out of the land, so we'll serve the LORD. He's our God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But Joshua told the people, "You can't serve the LORD, a holy, exclusive God that won't forgive your sins. 20If you serve foreign gods, he'll consume you after doing you good." 23"Then put away your foreign gods. Incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Joshua made a covenant with them that day at Shechem, with a statute and an ordinance 26that he wrote in the Law of God. He set up a large stone there under the oak in the LORD's sanctuary. 27He told the people, "This stone will testify against us. It has heard everything the LORD told us. It'll testify against you so you won't deal falsely with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Joshua sent everybody home to their inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> After that, Joshua died at 110. 30They buried him in his inheritance at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 31Israel served the LORD all his life and the lives of the elders that outlived him and knew what the LORD had done for Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The Israelites had brought up Joseph's bones from Egypt and buried them at Shechem in the piece of ground Jacob bought from the descendants of Hamor, Shechem's father, for 100 pieces of money. It became an inheritance for Joseph's descendants.</span>
