## Joshua Chapter 11

### Northern Kings Defeated

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard about it, he sent to Jobab, king of Madon, to the king of Shimron to the king of Achshaph,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> to the kings in the northern hill country, the Arabah south of Chinneroth, the western foothills, Naphothdor on the west,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> to the Canaanites in the east and west, the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites in the hill country, and Hivites on the slopes of <em>Mount </em>Hermon in the land of Mizpah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They came out with their troops, a large army like sand on the shore, with very many horses and chariots. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>All those kings joined forces, and came and camped together at the water by Merom.<strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD told Joshua, <em>“Don’t be afraid of them</em><em>. At t</em><em>his time tomorrow</em><em>,</em><em> I’ll </em><em>deliver them </em><em>to Israe</em><em>l</em><em>.</em><em> Hamstring their horses</em><em> and burn their chariots.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He came suddenly on them with all his fighting men. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The LORD gave them to Israel, who struck them and chased them to Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and eastward to the Valley of Mizpah. There weren’t any left. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Joshua hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 11:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Joshua turned back and took <u>Hazor</u> and struck its king with the sword. Hazor was formerly the head of those kingdoms. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The Israelites put to the sword everything in it that breathed, and Joshua burned Hazor. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He took the kings and their towns and destroyed them—like Moses the LORD’s servant commanded. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Israel didn’t burn towns that stood on mounds, but Joshua did burn Hazor. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The people took the spoil in those towns and the livestock for plunder. They struck every man with the sword till they’d destroyed them. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>What the LORD told Moses, Moses told Joshua, and he did it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Joshua conquered the hill country, the Negev, Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>from Mount Halak that rises toward Seir, all the way to Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He put their kings to death. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Joshua fought those kings for a long time. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>No city made peace with Israel except the Hivites in Gibeon. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The LORD hardened their hearts to come out against Israel so they’d be destroyed without mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> At that time, Joshua completely wiped out the Anakim and their towns in the hill county—Hebron, Debir, Anab, <em>and the towns in</em> <em>the territory of </em>Judah and Israel. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The only Anakim left were a few in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He took the whole land the way the LORD had told Moses. He gave it to Israel by tribal allotments. The land rested from war.<strong>    </strong><strong>Josh 11:10-23</strong> 	<strong>List of Defeated Kings</strong></span>
