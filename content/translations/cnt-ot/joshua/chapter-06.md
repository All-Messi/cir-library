<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The seven priests went forward blowing rams’ horns in front of the LORD with the Ark behind them. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The armed men went first ahead of the priests, and the rear guard came last after the Ark. The rams’ horns blew continually.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Joshua told the people, <em>“Don’t raise the battle cry</em><em> till the day I </em><em>tell</em><em> you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He sent the Ark around the city once. Then they spent the night in camp</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Joshua got up early, and the priests took the Ark, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and the seven priests went along, blowing the horns continually.

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city the same way seven times. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The seventh time, when the priests blew the rams’ horns, Joshua told the people, <em>“Raise the battle cry! The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> i</em><em>s</em><em> delivering</em><em> the city</em><em> to you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>The city and everything in it will be devoted to </em><em>him</em><em> for destruction.</em><em> </em><em>Only Rahab the harlot and her house</em><em>hold</em><em> will live</em><em>;</em><em> she hid the messengers we sent.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Make sure you keep </em><em>away </em><em>from the things devoted to destruction.</em><em> If</em><em> you ta</em><em>ke any devoted thing, you’ll </em><em>bring trouble on </em><em>Israel’s camp and get it destroyed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>All the silver and gold, the </em><em>bronze and iron items</em><em>, are </em><em>set aside</em><em> to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll go into </em><em>his </em><em>treasury.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>T</em><em>he priests</em> blew the rams’ horns. As soon as the people heard them, they raised the battle cry as loud as they could, and the wall down fell flat. Every man went straight ahead up into the city and took it. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>With swords they destroyed men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, and donkeys.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>                                                                                                                                                   </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Joshua told the two men that had spied out the land to go to the harlot’s house and bring her and her relatives out like they’d promised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>They went in and brought out her, her parents, brothers, and relatives; and put them outside the camp. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They burned the city and everything in it, but put in the LORD’s treasury the silver and gold, the bronze and iron items. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Rahab and her father’s family still live in Israel because she hid the spies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Joshua bound an oath on them, <em>“</em><em>C</em><em>ursed </em><em>by</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is any</em><em>one</em><em> that rebuilds this city.</em> <em>	</em><em>he’ll lay its foundation</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>t the cost of his </em><em>firstborn</em> <em>	</em><em>	and</em><em> set up its gates at the</em><em> cost of his youngest son</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>
