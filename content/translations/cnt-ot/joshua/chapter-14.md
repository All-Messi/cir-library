## Joshua Chapter 14

### Land West of the Jordan Divided

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> These are the territories the Israelites inherited in Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of families distributed. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Their inheritance came by lot for the 9½ tribes. <strong><sup>[</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>] </sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Joseph’s people consisted of two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. Moses just gave the Levites towns to live in along with land for pasturing livestock and raising crops for them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Israelites allotted the land like the LORD commanded.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Jephunneh the Kenizzite, told him, “You know what the LORD told Moses in Kadesh-barnea about you and me. 7I was 40 when Moses sent me to spy out the land. I brought back word to him as it was in my heart. 8But my brothers that went up with me made the people’s heart melt. Yet I wholly followed the LORD. 9Moses swore that day, ‘The land you’ve walked on will belong to you and your descendants permanently. You’ve followed the LORD my God.’ 10He has kept me alive these 45 years since he said that to Moses in the desert. Today I’m 85. 11I’m still as strong as I was when Moses sent me—strong for war and everyday life. 12Give me this hill country the LORD spoke about that day. At that time, you heard that Anakim were there with big, fortified towns. the LORD maybe with me, and I can drive them out.”


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Joshua blessed him and gave him Hebron. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>It’s still his inheritance because he wholly followed the LORD. (<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Hebron’s earlier name had been Kiriath<em>-</em>arba because Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) The land rested from war.</span>
