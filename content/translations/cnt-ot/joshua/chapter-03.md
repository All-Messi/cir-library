## Joshua Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joshua got up early and set out from Shittim with the people. They got to the Jordan and stayed there before they crossed. 2After three days the officers went through the camp 3and told the people, "When you see the priests pick up the Ark of the Covenant, follow it so you'll know where to go. You haven't gone this way before. 4Don't get near it. Stay back about 3,000ft."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Joshua told the people, "Sanctify yourselves; tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you." 6He told the priests to pick up the Ark and go out ahead of the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The LORD told Joshua, "Today I'll start elevating you in Israel so they'll know I'm with you like I was with Moses. 8Tell the priests that carry the Ark, when they come to the edge of the Jordan, to stand still in it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Joshua said, "Come and listen to a message from your God. 10This is how you'll know the living God is among you and will drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. 11The Ark will cross the Jordan first. 12Select a man from each of the 12 tribes. 13When the priests' feet rest in the water, the Jordan will stop flowing. The water coming downstream will pile up."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan 15When the priests waded into the water (The Jordan floods during harvest.), 16the water coming downstream piled up all the way back to Adam, a town beside Zarethan. What was flowing toward the Sea of Arabah (the Dead Sea) held back while the people crossed near Jericho. 17The priests stood on dry riverbed till the whole nation finished crossing.</span>
