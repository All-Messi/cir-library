## 2 Samuel Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The king was living in his palace, and the LORD had given him rest from his enemies. 2He told Nathan the prophet, "I live in a cedar palace, but God's Ark sits in tent curtains."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Nathan said, "Do everything you're thinking; the LORD's with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But that night a message from the LORD came to him, 5"Go tell my servant David, 'The LORD says, "Are you the one that should build me a temple? 6I haven't lived in a temple since I brought Israel out of Egypt. I've moved around in a tent, a Tabernacle.  7Wherever I've gone with Israel, did I ever say to any judge that I commanded to shepherd my people, 'Why haven't you built me a cedar temple?'"' 8"Tell David, 'I took you out of the pasture from following sheep, to make you ruler over Israel. 9I've been with you wherever you've gone and got rid of your enemies. I'll make you as famous as anyone that's ever lived in the world. 10I'll appoint a place to plant my people so they can live there undisturbed, and sinful people won't oppress them anymore. 11Like when I appointed judges over them, I'll give you rest from your enemies.' "The LORD also says he'll make a dynasty from you. 12-13'When you die, I'll raise up your descendant and establish his kingdom permanently.  13He'll build me a temple. 14I'll be his father, and he'll be my son. When he sins, I'll correct him with rods like people do. 15But my enduring love won't leave him like it did Saul, that I removed before you. 16Your family and kingdom will endure. I'll establish your dynasty permanently.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Nathan told David those things about the vision.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> David went in and sat in the LORD's presence, "Who am I, Lord GOD, and what's my family that you've brought me this far? 19Yet it wasn't a great thing to you, because you've also talked about my family far into the future according to human custom. 20What more can I tell you? You know me, Lord GOD! 21For your word and according to your heart, you've shown how great you are in letting me know. 22That's why you're great. There's nobody like you, no God besides you that we've heard of. 23What nation is like Israel that you went to redeem for yourself, to make a name for yourself, to do a great thing for yourself and awesome things for your land, in front of the people you've redeemed from Egypt, from nations and their gods? 24You've established your people forever and become their God. 25So confirm forever what you've said about me and my family. Do it 26so you can be honored forever by saying, 'The LORD of Hosts is Israel's God.' 27You've revealed to me that you'll build me into a dynasty; so I've found the courage to offer this prayer.  28You're God, your words are true, your promise is good. 29Bless my family so it can continue permanently like you've said."</span>
