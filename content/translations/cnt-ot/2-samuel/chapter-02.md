## 2 Samuel Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Afterwards David asked the LORD, "Should I go up to one of the towns in Judah?" David and his two wives went there. 3He brought his men up with their families, and they lived in towns around Hebron. 4Then the people in Judah came and anointed him king over Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> David sent them messengers, "The LORD bless you; you've been kind to Saul your lord and buried him. 6May the LORD show you enduring love and truth. I'll also show you goodness for doing that. 7Be strong and brave. Your lord is dead, and Judah has anointed me king."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But Abner, commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, to Mahanaim, 9and made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin—all Israel. 10Ish-bosheth was 40 and ruled for 2 years, but Judah followed David. 11For 7½ years he ruled Judah from Hebron.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Abner went from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the troops of Ish-bosheth. 13Joab son of Zeruiah and David's troops went to meet them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat on opposite sides of the pool. 14Abner told Joab, "Let's have the young men 'hold a contest.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They got up and went over by count, 12 for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and 12 for David's troops. 16Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword in the other's side, so they fell down together. So the place was called Helkath-hazzurim, in Gibeon. 17That day the battle became intense. David's forces beat Abner and the men of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Zeruiah's three sons were there: Joab, Abishal, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast as a gazelle in the field. 19He kept chasing Abner and wouldn't turn aside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Abner glanced back, "Asahel?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Abner repeated, "Turn aside. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I face your brother Joab?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But he wouldn't do it. So Abner jabbed him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and it came out of his back. He fell there and died. Everybody that came to where he died stood still.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But Joab and Abishal kept chasing Abner. As the sun was going down, they came to the Hill of Ammah by Giah by way of the Wilderness of Gibeon. 25The Benjamites gathered behind Abner, became one band, and stood on a hilltop.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He called to Joab, "Will the sword devour forever? Don't you know it will be bitter in the end? How long will you hold back from telling the people to quit chasing their brothers?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Joab said, "As God lives, if you hadn't said something, the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Joab blew the ram's horn, and the people quit chasing Israel and fighting. 29Abner and his men went through the Arabah all night, crossed the Jordan, and walked all morning to Mahanaim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Joab came back from chasing Abner. When he'd gathered the people, 19 of David's troops besides Asahel were missing. 31But David's troops had struck down 360 of Benjamin and Abner's men. 32They picked up Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled all night till dawn in Hebron.</span>
