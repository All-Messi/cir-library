## 2 Samuel Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Afterwards David asked the LORD, <em>“Should I go up to one of the towns in Judah?”</em> <em>“Go on up.”</em> <em>“Where?”</em> <em>“To Hebron.”</em> David and his two wives went there. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He brought his men up with their families, and they lived in towns around Hebron. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then the people in Judah came and anointed him king over Judah. They told him,<em> “The men in Jabesh-gilead have buried Saul.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>David sent them messengers, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> bless you; you’ve been kind to Saul your lord and buried him</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>May the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> show you enduring love and truth. I’ll also show you goodness for doing that. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Be strong and brave. Your lord is dead, and Judah has anointed me king.” </em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em></span>

### War Between Israel and Judah


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>But Abner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, to Mahanaim, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin—all Israel. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Ish-bosheth</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 40</p>

### and ruled for 2 years, but Judah followed David. 11For 7½ years he ruled Judah from Hebron.


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Abner went from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the troops of Ish-bosheth. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s troops went to meet them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat on opposite sides of the pool. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Abner told Joab, <em>“Let’s have the young men ‘hold a contest.’”</em> Joab said, <em>“Let them get up.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>They got up and went over by count, 12 for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth</span>
<p class="section-ref">and 12</p>

### for David’s troops. 16Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword in the other’s side, so they fell down together. So the place was called Helkath-hazzurim, in Gibeon. 17That day the battle became intense. David’s forces beat Abner and the men of Israel. 	2 Sam 2:8-17


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Zeruiah’s three sons were there: Joab, Abishal, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast as a gazelle in the field. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He kept chasing Abner and wouldn’t turn aside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Abner glanced back, <em>“Asahel?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>“Turn aside and grab one of the young men and take his spoil.”</em> But Asahel wouldn’t do it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Abner repeated, <em>“Turn aside. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I face your brother Joab?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>But he wouldn’t do it. So Abner jabbed him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and it came out of his back. He fell there and died. Everybody that came to where he died stood still.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>But Joab and Abishal kept chasing Abner. As the sun was going down, they came to the Hill of Ammah by Giah by way of the Wilderness of Gibeon. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The Benjamites gathered behind Abner, became one band, and stood on a hilltop.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>He called to Joab, <em>“Will the sword devour forever? Don’t you know it will be bitter in the end? How long will you hold back from telling the people to quit chasing their brothers?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Joab said, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>“As God lives, if you hadn’t said something, the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the people quit chasing Israel and fighting. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Abner and his men went through the Arabah all night, crossed the Jordan, and walked all morning to Mahanaim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Joab came back from chasing Abner. When he’d gathered the people, 19 of David’s troops besides Asahel were missing. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>But David’s troops had struck</span>
