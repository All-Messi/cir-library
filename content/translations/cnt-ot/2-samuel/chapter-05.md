## 2 Samuel Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> All the tribes came to David in Hebron and said, "We're your flesh and bones. 2When Saul was king, you were the one that led Israel out and back. The LORD told you you'd shepherd his people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Israel's elders came, and King David made a treaty with them in the LORD's presence. They anointed him king over Israel. 4David was 30 and ruled for 40 years. 5He ruled Judah for 7½ years in Hebron and ruled Judah and Israel for 33 years in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites. They told David. "You won't get in here. The blind and lame will stop you." They thought he couldn't do it, 7but he captured the Zion fortress, The City of David. 8He said that day, "Whoever strikes the Jebusites, reach 'the lame and blind' [that David hated] through the water tunnel." That's why people say, "'The blind and lame' won't get into the house." 9David lived in the fortress and named it The City of David [Ir-David]. He built all around from the Millo inward. 10He kept getting greater because the LORD God of Hosts was with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar timber, carpenters, and stonemasons to build him a palace. 12He realized that the LORD had established him as king and that he'd honored his kingdom for Israel's sake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Meantime, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron and had more sons and daughters. 14The ones born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 15Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 16Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When the Philistines heard they'd anointed David king over Israel, they went up to look for him.  He heard about it and went down to the fortress. 18The Philistines came and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 19David asked the LORD, "Should I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them to me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He went to Baal-perazim and defeated them, "'The LORD has broken through' my enemies like a flash flood"; so he named the place Baal-perazim. 21The Philistines abandoned their idols; David and his men carried them away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The Philistines came up again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 23When David asked the LORD, he said, "Don't go up directly. Circle around behind them and come at them by the balsam trees. 24When you hear marching in the balsam treetops, act immediately. I will have gone out ahead of you to strike them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> David did that and struck them down from Geba to Gezer.</span>
