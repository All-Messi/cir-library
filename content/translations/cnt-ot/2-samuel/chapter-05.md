<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Israel’s elders came, and King David made a treaty with them in the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em> presence. They anointed him king over Israel. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>David</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites. They told David. <em>“You won’t </em><em>get</em><em> in here</em><em>. T</em><em>he b</em><em>l</em><em>ind and lame will </em><em>stop you.</em><em>”</em> They thought he couldn’t do it, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>but he captured the Zion fortress, The City of David. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He said that day, <em>“Whoever strikes the Jebusites, reach </em><em>‘the lame and</em><em> blind</em><em>’ </em>[that David hated]<em> </em><em>through the water tunnel.”</em> That’s why people say, <em>“‘The blind and lame’ won’t get in</em><em>to</em><em> the house.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>David lived in the fortress and named it The City of David [<em>Ir-David</em>]. He built all around from the Millo inward. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He kept getting greater because the LORD God of Hosts was with him.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar timber, carpenters, and stonemasons to build him a palace. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He realized that the LORD had established him as king and that he’d honored his kingdom for Israel’s sake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Meantime, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron and had more sons and daughters. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The ones born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### David Defeats the Philistines


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>When the Philistines heard they’d anointed David king over Israel, they went up to look for him.  He heard about it and went down to the fortress. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The Philistines came and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>David asked the LORD, <em>“Should I attack</em><em> the Philistines?</em><em> </em><em>Will you deliver them to m</em>e<em>?”</em> <em>“</em><em>Yes</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He went to Baal-perazim and defeated them, <em>“</em><em>’</em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has broken through</em><em>’</em><em> my enemies like </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>flash flood</em><em>”</em>; so he named the place Baal-perazim. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>The Philistines</em> abandoned their idols; David and his men carried them away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The Philistines came up again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When David asked the LORD, he said, <em>“</em><em>Don’t go up directly. C</em><em>ircle around behind them and come at them </em><em>by</em><em> the balsam trees.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>When you hear</em><em> marching in the b</em><em>alsam treetops, act immediately. I</em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>will have gone out </em><em>ahead of</em><em> you to strike the</em><em>m</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>David did that and struck them down from Geba to Gezer.<strong>	 </strong></span>
