## 2 Samuel Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the spring when kings normally go to war, David sent Joab and Israel's army to destroy the Ammonites and lay siege to Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When evening came, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. From the roof he saw a woman taking a bath; she was beautiful. 3David sent and asked about her. Someone said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite?" 4David sent messengers and took her. When she came to him, he slept with her. When she'd purified herself, she went home. 5She got pregnant and sent and told David.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He sent to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." 7When he came, David asked how Joab and the people were doing and how the war was going. 8Then he told him, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." He left the king's palace, and a present was sent after him. 9But Uriah slept at the door of the king's palace with David's palace guard and didn't go home. 10When they told David, "Uriah didn't go home," he asked Uriah, "Haven't you come from a journey? Why didn't you go home?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He said, "The Ark, Israel, and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my commander Joab and his troops are camping in the open field. Would I go eat and drink and be with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I wouldn't do that."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> David told him, "Stay here today; I'll let you go tomorrow." Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 13David called him; he ate and drank with him and got him drunk. In the evening he went out to lie on his bed with David's palace guard and didn't go home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah, 15 "Put Uriah in the front of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him so he can be struck down." 16As Joab kept watch on the city, he put Uriah where he knew there were trained soldiers. 17Men came out of the city to fight, and some of David's soldiers fell, including Uriah. 18Joab sent a report to David about the war 19and charged the messenger, "When you've told the king everything, 20if he's angry and says, 'Why get so close to the city to fight? Didn't you know they'd shoot from the wall? 21Who struck down Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Wasn't it a woman that threw an upper millstone on him from the wall and he died at Thebez? Why get so close to the wall?'—then say, 'Uriah the Hittite is dead too.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The messenger reported, 23"The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them up to the entrance of the gate. 24The archers shot from the wall and killed some of your soldiers, including Uriah."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> David said, "Tell Joab, 'Don't let this get you down. The sword takes one as well as another. Intensify your battle against the city and overthrow it.' Encourage him that way."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When Uriah's wife heard he was dead, she mourned for him. 27When the time for mourning ended, David had her brought to his house; she became his wife and had a son. But what David had done the LORD considered sin.</span>
