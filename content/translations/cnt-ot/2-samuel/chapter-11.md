## 2 Samuel Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the spring when kings normally go to war, David sent Joab and Israel’s army to destroy the Ammonites and lay siege to Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>When evening came, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. From the roof he saw a woman taking a bath; she was beautiful. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>David sent and asked about her. Someone said, <em>“Is</em><em>n’t this Bathsheba,</em><em> daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>David sent messengers and took her. When she came to him, he slept with her. When she’d purified herself, she went home. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>She got pregnant and sent and told David.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>He sent to Joab, <em>“Send </em>me <em>Uriah the Hittite.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When he came, David asked how Joab and the people were doing and how the war was going. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then he told him, <em>“Go </em><em>down to your house</em><em> and wash your feet.”</em> He left the king’s palace, and a present was sent after him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s palace with David’s palace guard and didn’t go home. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When they told David, <em>“Uriah didn’t</em><em> go </em><em>home</em><em>,”</em> he asked Uriah,<em> “</em><em>Haven’t you come from a journey?</em><em> </em><em>Why did</em><em>n’t you </em><em>go </em><em>home</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>He said, <em>“The Ark,</em><em> Israel</em><em>,</em><em> and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my </em><em>commander</em><em> Joab and </em><em>his</em><em> </em><em>troops</em><em> are </em><em>camping in the open field. Would</em><em> I go eat and drink and be with my wife?</em><em> </em><em>By your life and the life of your soul, I wo</em><em>uld</em><em>n’t do that.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>David told him, <em>“Stay here today</em><em>; </em><em>I’ll let you go</em><em> tomorrow</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>David called him; he ate and drank with him and got him drunk. In the evening he went out to lie on his bed with David’s palace guard and didn’t go home.<strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong> <em>“Put Uriah in the front of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him so he </em><em>can</em><em> be struck down.”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>As Joab kept watch on the city, he put Uriah where he knew there were trained soldiers. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Men came out of the city to fight, and some of David’s soldiers fell, including Uriah. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Joab sent a report to David about the war <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and charged the messenger, <em>“When you’ve t</em><em>old</em><em> the king </em><em>everything</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>if</em><em> </em><em>he’s</em><em> ang</em><em>ry </em><em>and says</em><em>, ‘Why get</em><em> so </em><em>close to the city to fight? Didn’t you</em><em> know </em><em>they’</em><em>d shoot from the wall?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Who struck down Abimelech </em><em>son of Jerubbesheth? Wasn’t it </em><em>a woman </em><em>that thre</em><em>w an upper millstone on him from the wall </em><em>and</em><em> he died at Thebez?</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>get so close to</em><em> the wall?’—th</em><em>en say, ‘</em><em>Uriah the Hittite is dead </em><em>too</em><em>.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The messenger reported, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them </em><em>up to</em><em> the entrance of the gate.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>The archers shot from the wall</em><em> and killed some of your soldiers, including Uriah</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>David said, <em>“Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this </em><em>get </em><em>you</em><em> down. T</em><em>he sword </em><em>take</em><em>s one as well as another.</em><em> Intensify</em><em> your battle against the city </em><em>and overthrow it.’ E</em><em>ncourage him</em><em> that way</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>When Uriah’s wife heard he was dead, she mourned for him. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>When the time for mourning ended, David had her brought to his house; she became his wife and had a son. But what David had done the LORD considered sin.<strong>	  </strong></span>
