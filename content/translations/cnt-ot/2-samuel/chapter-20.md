## 2 Samuel Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A troublemaker happened to be there—Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite. He blew the ram's horn and said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The men from Israel deserted David and followed Sheba. But Judah stayed firmly committed to their king and escorted him from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> David went to his palace in Jerusalem. The ten concubines he'd left behind to keep the house, he put under guard and took care of them; but didn't have relations with them. They like widows till they died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then the king told Amasa, "Call out Judah's army within three days and be present here with them." 5Amasa went to call them out, but it took him longer than the appointed time. 6David told Abishai, "Sheba will do us more damage than Absalom. Take my troops and pursue him so he won't get into fortified towns and escape from me." 7So Joab's men, along with the king's bodyguard and the strong warriors, left to pursue Sheba. 8When they were at the large boulder at Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a dagger in its sheath fastened at his waist. As he stepped forward, it came out. 9Joab said to Amasa, "Are you doing well, brother?" Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 10Amasa wasn't on guard against the dagger in Joab's left hand. He struck him in the stomach just once and poured out his entrails on the ground, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba. 11One of Joab's young men stood by him and said, "Whoever is for Joab and David, follow Joab." 12But Amasa lay wallowing in his blood on the road. When the young man saw that everybody was standing still, he took Amasa off the road into the field and threw a cloak over him. 13Then the men went on behind Joab to pursue Sheba.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Sheba went through the tribes of Israel to Abel, as far as Beth-maacah and the Berites. They gathered and went with him too. 15Joab's forces laid siege to Sheba in Abel Beth-maacah and threw a siege ramp up against the city's fortifications. The people that were with Joab were starting to knock down the wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But a wise woman called out from the town, "Tell Joab to come here so I can talk to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He approached her and she said, "Are you Joab?" 18"People have always said, 'They'll certainly ask advice at Abel.' That's how they settled disputes. 19I'm among the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You're trying to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why swallow up the LORD's inheritance?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Joab answered, "I'd never swallow up or destroy you! 21Sheba son of Bicri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has risen up against King David. Hand him over and I'll leave."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The woman wisely went to the people. They cut off Sheba's head and threw it to Joab. He blew the ram's horn, and they pulled back from the city and went home. Joab went back to the king at Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Joab commanded Israel's whole army,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Adoram managed forced labor,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Sheva was secretary,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Ira, descendant of Jair, was David's personal priest.</span>
