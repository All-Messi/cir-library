## 2 Samuel Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A troublemaker happened to be there—Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite. He blew the ram’s horn and said, <em>“We </em><em>don’t have any</em><em> </em><em>part with</em><em> David</em> <em>	</em><em>	or any</em><em> inheritance in </em><em>Jesse’s</em><em> son.</em> <em>	Every</em><em>body,</em><em> </em><em>go home</em><em>, Israel!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>The men from Israel deserted David and followed Sheba. But Judah stayed firmly committed to their king <em>and escorted him </em>from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>David went to his palace in Jerusalem. The ten concubines he’d left behind to keep the house, he put under guard and took care of them; but didn’t have relations with them. They like widows till they died.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>2 Sam</strong><strong> </strong><strong>20:1-3</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Then the king told Amasa, <em>“Call out Judah</em><em>’s army</em><em> within three days and be present here</em><em> with them</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Amasa went to call them out, but it took him longer than the appointed time. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>David told Abishai, <em>“Sheba will do us more </em><em>damage</em><em> than Absalom.</em><em> </em><em>Take </em><em>my troops and pursue him s</em><em>o he won’t </em><em>get into</em><em> fortified </em><em>towns</em><em> and escape from</em><em> me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So Joab’s men, along with the king’s bodyguard and the strong warriors, left to pursue Sheba. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When they were at the large boulder at Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a dagger in its sheath fastened at his waist. As he stepped forward, it came out. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Joab said to Amasa, <em>“</em><em>Are</em><em> you</em><em> doing well</em><em>, brother?”</em> Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Amasa wasn’t on guard against the dagger in Joab’s <em>left </em>hand. He struck him in the stomach just once and poured out his entrails on the ground, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>One of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, <em>“Whoever </em><em>is for</em><em> Joab and David, follow Joab.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But Amasa lay wallowing in his blood on the road. When the young man saw that everybody was standing still, he took Amasa off the road into the field and threw a cloak over him. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Then the men went on behind Joab to pursue <em>Sheba</em>.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><em>Sheba</em> went through the tribes of Israel to Abel, as far as Beth-maacah and the Berites. They gathered and went with him too. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Joab’s forces </em>laid siege to <em>Sheba</em> in Abel Beth-maacah and threw a siege ramp up against the city’s fortifications. The people that were with Joab were starting to knock down the wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>But a wise woman called out from the town, <em>“</em><em>Tell Joab to c</em><em>ome here so I can talk to </em><em>him.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>He approached her and she said, <em>“Are you Joab?</em><em>”</em> <em>“Yes” </em> <em>“Listen </em><em>to</em><em> me</em><em>	</em><em>.”</em> <em>“I’m listening.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“People have always said, ‘They’ll certainly ask advice at Abel.’ That’s how they settled disputes. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I’m among the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You’re trying to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why swallow up the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> inheritance?”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 20:14-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Joab answered, <em>“I’d never</em><em> swallow up or destroy</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Sheba son of Bicri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has risen up against King David.</em><em> Hand him over</em><em> and I’ll leave.”</em> The woman said, <em>“</em><em>We’ll throw h</em><em>is head to you over the wall.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The woman wisely went to the people. They cut off Sheba’s head and threw it to Joab. He blew the ram’s horn, and they pulled back from the city and went home. Joab went back to the king at Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Joab commanded Israel’s whole army, Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Adoram managed forced labor, Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was royal historian,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Sheva was secretary, Zadok and Abiathar were priests, and</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Ira, descendant of Jair, was David’s personal priest.<strong>	 </strong></span>
