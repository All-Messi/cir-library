## 2 Samuel Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When David had gone a little past the summit, Ziba, Mephibosheth's steward, met him with a couple saddled donkeys. They were carrying 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 summer fruits, and a skin of wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The king asked, "Why do you have these?" "The donkeys are for the king's family to ride. The bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for anybody to drink that's become exhausted in the country."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He told Ziba, "You can have everything Mephibosheth owns."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When David got to Bahurim, Shimei son of Gera, a man from Saul's family, came out cursing 6and throwing stones at David and his aides.  The troops and bodyguard were all around him. 7He cursed, "Get out of here, you bloody, worthless fellow! 8The LORD has brought back on you the bloodshed of Saul's family in whose place you've ruled. He's given the kingdom to Absalom. You're caught in your own evil; you're a murderer."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Abishai asked the king, "Why should this dead dog curse you? Let me go over and cut off his head." 10"What do I have to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? If he curses and the LORD has told him to, why interfere?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then David told Abishai and his aides, "My own son wants to kill me. How much more this Benjamite! Let him curse; the LORD has told him to. 12Maybe the LORD will regard my suffering and return me good for his cursing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> David and his men followed the road. Shimei went along on the hillside parallel to him, cursing and throwing stones and dirt at him. 14The king and the people with him arrived exhausted, and he refreshed himself there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then Absalom, Ahithophel, and the men of Israel went to Jerusalem. 16Hushai the Archite, David's personal advisor, went to Absalom and said, "Long live the king!" 18"I'm for the one the LORD and his people have chosen. 19Besides, shouldn't I serve in your presence as I've served in your father's presence?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Absalom asked Ahithophel, "What's your advice?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Ahithophel said, "Have relations with your father's concubines that he left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you've made yourself repugnant to your father beyond reconciliation. That will encourage everybody that's with you to strengthen their support for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he had relations with his father's concubines right out in the open for all Israel to see. 23By both David and Absalom, Ahithophel's advice in those days was considered the same as inquiring from God's oracle.</span>
