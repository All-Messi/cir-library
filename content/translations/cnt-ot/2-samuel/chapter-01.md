## 2 Samuel Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After Saul died, David came back from massacring the Amalekites and stayed two days in Ziklag. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The third day, a man came from Saul’s camp with torn clothes and dust on his head. He prostrated himself to David.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>David said, <em>“Where </em><em>have</em><em> you come from?”</em> <em>“I’ve escaped from </em><em>Israel’s</em><em> camp.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“H</em><em>ow did things go?”</em> <em>“They’ve fled from the battle; many have fallen. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“How do you know?”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and Saul was leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry were coming up on him. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>When he looked back, he called out to me, </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>‘Who are you?</em>’ <em>“I’m an Amalekite.’</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>“He said, <em>‘Please finish me off. I’m in agony; my life lingers on.’</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“So I stood beside him and killed him. I knew he couldn’t live. I took the crown off his head and the armband from his arm and brought them to you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>David and his men tore their clothes. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They mourned and cried and fasted till evening for Saul, Jonathan, the LORD’s people, and Israel, because they’d fallen by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>David asked the young man, <em>“Where are you from?”</em> <em>“I’m the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>David said, <em>“How is it you weren’t afraid to destroy the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> anointed?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>He called one of the young men, <em>“Cut him down.”</em> So he struck him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>David told him, <em>“Your blood is on your own head. You testified against yourself that you killed the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> anointed.”</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>David chanted this dirge over Saul and Jonathan. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He told them to teach Judah the Son of the Bod; the Book of Jashar records it:</span>

### David’s Lament for Saul and Jonathan 19“Your beauty, Israel, is slain on your high places! 		How the strong have fallen!


<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>Don’t tell it in Gath</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>o</em><em>r announce it in the streets of Ashkelon;</em> <em>	</em><em>	the Philistines would celebrate;</em> <em>	</em><em>	the uncircumcised would be elated.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>Mountains of Gilboa,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>m</em><em>ay there be no dew or rain on you</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>o</em><em>r fields to produce offerings</em> <em>	</em><em>	because the shield of strong men was defiled there,</em> <em>	</em><em>	Saul’s shield, not anointed with oil.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the strong,</em> <em>	</em><em>	Jonathan’s bow didn’t retreat;</em> <em>	</em><em>	Saul’s sword didn’t come back empty. </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 1:19-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Saul </em><em>and</em><em> Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in life,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>d</em><em>ied together.</em> <em>	They were faster than eagles,</em> <em>s</em><em>tronger than lions.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Young women of Israel, mourn for Saul,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>w</em><em>ho dressed you luxuriously in scarlet,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>w</em><em>ho put gold sequins on your clothe</em><em>s</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Ho</em><em>w</em><em> the strong have fallen in battle!</em> <em>	</em><em>	Jonathan, slain on your high places.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>I’m distressed over you, Jonathan my brother;</em> <em>	</em><em>	you were so pleasant to me.</em> <em>	Your love for me was more wonderful</em> <em>	</em><em>	than the love of women.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>How the powerful have fallen,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and the weapons of war have perished!”         </em></span>
