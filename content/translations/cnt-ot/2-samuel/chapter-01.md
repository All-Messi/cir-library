## 2 Samuel Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After Saul died, David came back from massacring the Amalekites and stayed two days in Ziklag. 2The third day, a man came from Saul's camp with torn clothes and dust on his head. He prostrated himself to David.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> SAMUEL</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> David said, "Where have you come from?" "They've fled from the battle; many have fallen. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead." 6"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and Saul was leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry were coming up on him. 7When he looked back, he called out to me, 8'Who are you?' 10"So I stood beside him and killed him. I knew he couldn't live. I took the crown off his head and the armband from his arm and brought them to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> David and his men tore their clothes. 12They mourned and cried and fasted till evening for Saul, Jonathan, the LORD's people, and Israel, because they'd fallen by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> David asked the young man, "Where are you from?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> David said, "How is it you weren't afraid to destroy the LORD's anointed?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He called one of the young men, "Cut him down."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> David told him, "Your blood is on your own head. You testified against yourself that you killed the LORD's anointed." 17David chanted this dirge over Saul and Jonathan. 18He told them to teach Judah the Son of the Bod; the Book of Jashar records it:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Don't tell it in Gath</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Mountains of Gilboa,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the strong,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in life,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Young women of Israel, mourn for Saul,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> How the strong have fallen in battle!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I'm distressed over you, Jonathan my brother;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> How the powerful have fallen,</span>
