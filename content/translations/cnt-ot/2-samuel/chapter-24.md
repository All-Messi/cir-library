## 2 Samuel Chapter **24**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Again the LORD’s anger burned against Israel, and he aroused David to count the people in Israel and Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>The king told Joab the commander of the army, <em>“Go through the tribes from Dan to Beersheba, </em><em>and </em><em>register the people so I can know how many there are.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>But Joab said, <em>“</em><em>M</em><em>ay the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God </em><em>multiply</em><em> the people</em><em> 100 times </em><em>while </em><em>you can</em><em> still </em><em>see it,</em><em> but why delight in this?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>But the king’s word prevailed over Joab and his commanders; so they spread out to register the people. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer in the middle of the Valley of Gad and then went on toward Jazer. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They went to Gilead and the area around Tahtim-hodshi, to Dan-jaan and on around to Sidon, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>to the fortress of Tyre and the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites; and to the south of Judah to Beersheba. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When they’d cycled through the country, they came to Jerusalem</span>

### months and 20 days, 9and Joab reported the number of the census. 		                                                                                                                             2 Sam 24:1-9  God’s Judgment on David’s Sin


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>David’s conscience got to bothering him after he’d counted the people. He told the LORD, <em>“I’ve </em><em>committed a serious </em><em>sin</em><em>, b</em><em>ut please take away </em><em>my</em><em> </em><em>guilt.</em><em> I’ve acted foolishly.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When he got up in the morning, a message from the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Tell</em><em> Dav</em><em>id </em><em>I’</em><em>m offering him three choice</em><em>s.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Gad went and asked David, <em>“</em><em>Wi</em><em>ll </em><em>three </em>[1 Chron</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>David told Gad, <em>“I’m </em><em>really</em><em> distress</em><em>ed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s fall into the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> hand</em><em>. H</em><em>e has great mercy</em><em>;</em><em> don’t let me fall into </em><em>human</em><em> hand</em><em>s</em><em>.”</em><strong>	 </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	              </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 24:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from morning till the appointed time; 70,000 people died from Dan to Beersheba. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When the angel held out his hand out toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented, <em>“That’s enough.</em><em> Relax</em><em> your hand.”</em><em> </em>The angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When David saw the angel, he said to the LORD, <em>“I’m the one that sinned</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> </em><em>did wrong. W</em><em>hat have the</em><em>se sheep</em><em> done?</em><em> Put yourself </em><em>against me and my father’s </em><em>family</em><em>.”</em><strong>	  </strong></span>

### David Builds an Altar


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Gad went to David that day and said, <em>“Go </em><em>build</em><em> an altar to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>David went up like he said. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Araunah looked down and saw him and his men crossing over toward him. He went out and bowed to the ground. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Why </em><em>have you </em><em>come to </em><em>me</em><em>?”</em><em> </em> <em>“To buy </em><em>your</em><em> threshing floor </em><em>and</em><em> build an altar to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> so </em><em>he</em><em>’ll hold back </em><em>the plague from the people.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Araunah told him, <em>“T</em><em>ake and offer what </em><em>you want</em><em> to</em><em>:</em><em> the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and yokes for wood.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>You </em><em>can have it all.</em><em> </em><em>May the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God accept you.”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“No, I’ll buy it from you</em><em>.</em><em> I won’t offer burnt offerings that don’t cost me anything.”</em> He bought the threshing floor and oxen</span>
