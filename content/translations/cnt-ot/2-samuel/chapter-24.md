## 2 Samuel Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Again the LORD's anger burned against Israel, and he aroused David to count the people in Israel and Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The king told Joab the commander of the army, "Go through the tribes from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people so I can know how many there are."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But Joab said, "May the LORD your God multiply the people 100 times while you can still see it, but why delight in this?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But the king's word prevailed over Joab and his commanders; so they spread out to register the people. 5They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer in the middle of the Valley of Gad and then went on toward Jazer. 6They went to Gilead and the area around Tahtim-hodshi, to Dan-jaan and on around to Sidon, 7to the fortress of Tyre and the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites; and to the south of Judah to Beersheba. 8When they'd cycled through the country, they came to Jerusalem after 9 months and 20 days, 9and Joab reported the number of the census.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> David's conscience got to bothering him after he'd counted the people. He told the LORD, "I've committed a serious sin, but please take away my guilt. I've acted foolishly." 11When he got up in the morning, a message from the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, 12"Tell David I'm offering him three choices."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Gad went and asked David, "Will three [1 Chronicles 21:12] years of famine come on you and your land? Will you flee from your enemies for three months? Or will there be a three-day plague in your land? Which answer will I take back to the One who sent me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> David told Gad, "I'm really distressed. Let's fall into the LORD's hand. He has great mercy; don't let me fall into human hands."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from morning till the appointed time; 70,000 people died from Dan to Beersheba. 16When the angel held out his hand out toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented, "That's enough. Relax your hand." The angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 17When David saw the angel, he said to the LORD, "I'm the one that sinned. I did wrong. What have these sheep done? Put yourself against me and my father's family."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Gad went to David that day and said, "Go build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite." 19David went up like he said. 20Araunah looked down and saw him and his men crossing over toward him. He went out and bowed to the ground. 21He said, "Why have you come to me?" "To buy your threshing floor and build an altar to the LORD so he'll hold back the plague from the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Araunah told him, "Take and offer what you want to: the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and yokes for wood. 23You can have it all. May the LORD your God accept you." 24"No, I'll buy it from you. I won't offer burnt offerings that don't cost me anything." He bought the threshing floor and oxen for 20 oz 50 shekels of silver. 25He built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The LORD was moved by David's petition for the country and held back the plague.</span>
