## 2 Samuel Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> David sang this song to the LORD when he delivered him from his enemies and from Saul:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I called on him who deserves praise,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The waves of death entangled me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In my desperation I cried out to the LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Smoke poured out of his nostrils;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He lowered the sky too</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He rode on a cherub</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He made blackness a canopy around him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Coals of fire flamed out</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD thundered from the sky;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He shot arrows and scattered my enemies;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then the water in the sea receded;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He reached down from on high and grabbed me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He delivered me from powerful enemies</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They attacked me in a time of catastrophe,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He brought me out into a safe place</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I stood blameless in front of him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> So the LORD has rewarded me according to my goodness—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You rescue the humble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> You're my lamp, LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> With your help I can crush a battalion;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> God's way is perfect;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> I chased my enemies and overtook them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> I thrust them through so they couldn't get up again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> You've made my enemies retreat;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> They looked around for help, but there wasn't any;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> I pulverized them like dust,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Foreigners pretend to submit as soon as they hear me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> So I'll thank you among the Gentiles, LORD, 51You're a tower of victory for your king</span>
