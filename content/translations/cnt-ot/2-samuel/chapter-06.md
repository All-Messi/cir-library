## 2 Samuel Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>David gathered elite troops from Israel again, 30,000. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He and the troops went to Baale-judah to bring up God’s Ark called The Name: the LORD of Hosts Enthroned Above the Cherubs.<em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They placed the Ark on a new cart to bring it from Abinadab’s house that was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab’s sons, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>were bringing the Ark on the cart; Ahio was walking ahead of it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Meanwhile, David and the House of Israel were celebrating enthusiastically in the LORD’s presence with all kinds of instruments made out of fir: lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>But when they came to Nacon’s threshing floor, Uzzah grabbed the Ark because the oxen nearly upset it. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The LORD lashed out and struck him down for his disrespect. He died there by the Ark. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>David was mad because the LORD had “lashed out against Uzzah.” The place is still called Perez-uzzah. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>David was afraid of the LORD that day, <em>“H</em><em>ow can the A</em><em>rk come to me?”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He wasn’t willing to take it to The City of David. He took it aside to the house of Obed-edom of Gath. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>It stayed there three months, and the LORD blessed him and his family.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>King David heard<em> </em>that the LORD had blessed Obed-edom’s house and everything he had because of the Ark, so he brought it to The City of David with celebration. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When the ones carrying the Ark had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a grain-fed calf. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He was dancing in the LORD’s presence with all his energy, wearing a linen ephod. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He and the House of Israel brought up the Ark with shouting and the sound of rams’ horns. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>As it came into the city, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked out the window and saw him leaping and dancing, and she despised him. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They brought the Ark and set it in its place inside the tent David pitched for it, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When he’d finished offering them, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He passed out a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to every man and woman in the crowd. Then everybody went home.<strong>   </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>When David went back to bless his household, Michal came out, <em>“How </em><em>Israel’s</em><em> king distinguished himself today</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>exposing</em><em> himself in </em><em>front of</em><em> his </em><em>servant girls</em><em> </em><em>like a shameless fool</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>He told her, <em>“I</em><em> celebrated</em><em> </em><em>in front of</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, who chose me </em><em>over your father and his family, and</em><em> appoint</em><em>ed</em><em> me </em><em>to rule</em><em> </em><em>his</em><em> people.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>I’ll be </em><em>even less</em><em> </em><em>dignified</em><em> than this and humble in my own eyes, but I’ll be </em><em>respected by</em><em> the </em><em>servant girls</em><em> you</em><em>’ve mentioned</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Michal didn’t have any children the rest of her life.<strong>	 </strong></span>
