## 2 Samuel Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and David’s son Ammon was in love with her. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister that he made himself ill, because she was a virgin and it seemed hard to do anything to her. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But Amnon had a friend Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, and Jonadab was a shrewd fellow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>He said to him, <em>“Son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning?</em><em> </em><em>Won’t you tell me?</em><em> </em> Amnon said,<em> “I’m in love with Tamar, the sister of my </em><em>half-</em><em>brother Absalom.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Jonadab said, <em>“Lie down on your bed and </em><em>act like you’re sick</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Let my sister come and give me something to eat, and let her fix the food so I can see it and she can hand it to me.</em><strong><em><sup>’</sup></em></strong><strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king went to see him, Amnon said, <em>“Please let my sister Tamar </em><em>come and mak</em><em>e me a couple cakes.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 13:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>David sent for Tamar, and said, <em>“Go to your brother Amnon’s house and fix him some food.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So Tamar went to his house, and he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes while he watched, and baked the cakes. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>She took the pan and dished them out for him, but he refused to eat. He said, “<em>Have everybody leave me.”</em> So everybody left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Amnon said, <em>“Bring the food into the bedroom so you can give it to me to eat.”</em> Tamar took the cakes and brought them into his bedroom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>When she brought them to him, he took hold of her and said, <em>“Come, lie with me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>She answered him, <em>“No, don’</em><em>t violate me</em><em>! S</em><em>uch a thing is not done in Israel.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t do this </em><em>awful</em><em> thing!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Where could I get rid of my </em><em>disgrace</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>And you’ll be like one of the fools in Israel.</em><em> Please speak to the king. H</em><em>e won’t withhold me from you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>But he wouldn’t listen to her. Since he was stronger than she was, he violated her and lay with her.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 13:7-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Then Amnon hated her more than he’d loved her. He told her, <em>“Get up, go away!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>She told him, <em>“No</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>S</em><em>ending me away is </em><em>worse</em><em> than the other </em><em>sin </em><em>you’ve done to me!”</em> But he wouldn’t listen to her. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He called the young man that attended him and said, <em>“T</em><em>hrow this woman out, and lock the door behind her.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>She was wearing a long-sleeved robe, because that’s the way the king’s virgin daughters dressed in robes. His attendant took her out and locked the door behind her. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment. She put her hand on her head and went away, wailing as she went.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Then Absalom asked her, <em>“Has Amnon been with y</em><em>ou? Keep quiet </em>for now<em>, my sister, he’</em><em>s your brother.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t t</em><em>a</em><em>ke this matter </em><em>to heart</em><em>.”</em> Tamar stayed as a desolate woman in her brother’s house. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When King David heard about this, he was angry. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Absalom wouldn’t speak to Amnon because of what he’d done to his sister. <strong>	</strong></span>

### Absalom Kills Amnon


<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Two years later Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor near Ephraim and invited all the royal sons. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He went to the king and said, <em>“</em><em>I have sheep-shearers. You and your officials go with me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>“No</em><em>, son, we shouldn’t all go. W</em><em>e</em><em>’d</em><em> be a burden to you.</em><em>” </em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>“If not, let my </em><em>half-</em><em>brother Amnon go with us.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Why?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>But when Absalom kept urging him, he let Amnon and the king’s sons go with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Absalom told his men, <em>“</em><em>W</em><em>hen Amnon</em><em> is half drunk with wine and</em><em> I </em><em>say, ‘Strike him down,’ </em><em>put him to death.</em><em> Don’t be afraid. H</em><em>aven’t I commanded you?</em><em> </em><em>Be courageous and </em><em>brave</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong> Absalom’s men did what he said, and the king’s sons got on their mules and fled.<strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 13:23-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>While they were on their way, the report came to David, <em>“Absalom struck down </em><em>your </em><em>sons; </em><em>there’s not a one</em><em> left.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The king got up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground. His servants stood by him with torn clothes. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Jonadab, son of David’s brother Shimeah, answered, <em>“Don’t suppose they’ve </em><em>killed</em><em> all </em><em>your </em><em>sons</em><em>—just Amnon. Absalom has intended to do that ever since </em>Ammon<em> violated his</em><em> </em><em>sister Tamar.</em><em>” [</em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>]</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>Absalom had fled. The young man that was the watchman looked up and saw many people coming from the road behind him beside the mountain. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Jonadab told the king, <em>“</em><em>Your </em><em>sons </em><em>are her</em><em>e.</em><em> </em><em>It’s </em><em>what I said </em><em>would</em><em> happen</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>As soon as he’d finished talking, the king’s sons came and cried out loud. The king and his servants also cried bitterly. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong><strong><sup>-38</sup></strong>Absalom fled to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur, for three years. David mourned for him every day. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>He really wanted to go out to Absalom, because he was at peace over Amnon, since he was dead.<strong>	 </strong></span>
