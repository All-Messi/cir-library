### ,000 men to pursue David tonight. 2I’ll attack him while he’s exhausted and terrify him. The people with him will run. I’ll only strike down the king 3and bring the people back to you. Everybody’s return depends on the man you’re looking for. Then the people will be at peace.”


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The plan pleased Absalom and Israel’s elders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Then Absalom said, <em>“Call Hushai. L</em><em>et’s hear what he has to say.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When Hushai came, Absalom said, <em>“</em><em>That’s what Ahithophel said</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Should</em><em> we do it? If not, tell us what </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> think</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Hushai said, <em>“</em><em>That’s</em><em> not </em><em>a </em><em>good</em><em> idea</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>our father and his men are </em><em>strong men</em><em>, </em><em>as </em><em>fierce </em><em>as</em><em> a bear robbed of her cubs</em><em> out in the open</em><em>.</em><em> He’</em><em>s an expert in warfare</em><em>. He</em><em> </em><em>won’t</em><em> spend the night with the people.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>He</em><em>’s probably already hid</em><em> in </em><em>a cave or some</em><em>place.</em><em> When he falls on your men in</em><em> the first attack, whoever hears</em><em> about it will say he’s</em><em> slaughter</em><em>ed your followers</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Even</em><em> </em><em>a man with a lion’s </em><em>heart will</em><em> completely lose heart. A</em><em>ll Israel knows your father is a </em><em>strong warrior,</em><em> and </em><em>everybody with him is brave</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I advise </em><em>you to gather Israel</em><em> from Dan </em><em>to Beersheba, like sand </em><em>by the sea, and </em><em>go personally </em><em>into battle.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>e’ll come to him in </em><em>a place where he can be found. W</em><em>e’ll </em><em>descend</em><em> on him like dew on the ground</em><em> and not leave</em><em> </em><em>a man with him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>If he withdraws into a city, Israe</em><em>l will bring ropes, and drag it in</em><em>to the valley till </em><em>there’s </em><em>not a small stone</em><em> left</em><em> there.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 17:1-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Absalom and the men of Israel said, <em>“</em><em>Hushai’s advice is better than </em><em>Ahithophel</em><em>’s</em><em>.”</em><em> That happened </em>because the LORD had ordained to thwart Ahithophel’s good advice so the LORD could bring catastrophe on Absalom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar the priests<em>, </em> <em>“This is what Ahi</em><em>thophel advised Absalom and Israel’s </em><em>elders to do, and this is what I’ve advised.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Quick, s</em><em>end and tell David</em><em> not to spend the night at the fords in</em><em> the </em><em>open country; he needs to cross over so he and his people won’t get</em><em> destroyed.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel. A servant girl would go tell them, and they’d tell David, because it was dangerous for them to be seen going into the city. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>But a lad did see them and told Absalom. <em>Jonathan and Ahimaaz</em> left in a hurry and came to the house of a man in Bahurim that had a well in his courtyard, and they got down into it. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The woman had covered the well’s mouth and scattered grain on it so you couldn’t tell it was there. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Absalom’s men came to her at the house, <em>“Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”</em> She said, <em>“They’ve crossed the </em><em>river</em><em>.”</em> When they searched and couldn’t find them, they went back to Jerusalem.<strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 17:17-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>After they left, the men came up out of the well and went to tell David. <em>“Quick, get up and </em><em>cross the water because Ahithophel has advised against you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>David and every person with him crossed the Jordan by sunup. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When Ahithophel saw that Absalom hadn’t followed his advice, he saddled his donkey and went to his town. He set his house in order and hanged himself. They buried him in his father’s grave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>David went to Mahanaim. Absalom and his men crossed the Jordan. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was Joab’s cousin and son of Jithra the Israelite, who married Abigail daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Israel and Absalom camped in Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>When David got to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai of Gilead from Rogelim, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>brought David and the ones with him sleeping mats, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans, lentils, parched seeds, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd. They said, <em>“The people are </em><em>surely </em><em>hungry</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>exhausted, </em><em>and thirsty </em><em>here </em><em>in the </em><em>countryside</em><em>.”</em><em>  </em><em>	</em><em>	</em></span>
