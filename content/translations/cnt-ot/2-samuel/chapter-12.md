<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then the LORD sent Nathan to David to say, <em>“T</em><em>wo men </em><em>were </em><em>in a </em><em>town</em><em>, one rich</em><em>,</em><em> the other poor.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>The rich man had </em><em>lots of</em><em> flocks and herds, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb that he’d bought and raised.</em><em> </em><em>It grew up with him and his children; it used to eat his brea</em><em>d and drink from his cup and li</em><em>e in his lap; it was like a daughter to him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>A traveler ca</em><em>me to the rich man, and he wasn’</em><em>t willing to take one of his own flock or herd to fix</em> a meal<em> for </em><em>him. H</em><em>e took the poor man’s lamb and fixed it.”</em> David was mad, and swore to Nathan, <em>“As sure as the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives, that</em><em> m</em><em>an deserves to</em><em> die.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He’ll restore</em><em> the la</em><em>mb fourfold because he did that</em><em> </em><em>without mercy</em><em>.”</em><em>	 </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Nathan told David, <em>“You’</em><em>re th</em><em>at</em><em> man.</em><em> </em> <em>“</em><em>Th</em><em>is is what </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God of Israel</em><em>, says, ‘I anointed you king</em><em>, and delivered you from Saul.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> </em><em>gave you your master’s </em><em>family</em><em>, </em><em>his</em><em> wives, and Israel and Judah.</em><em> If</em><em> that wasn’t enough, I would </em><em>have doubled it</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Why have you despised my message</em><em> and done wha</em><em>t I consider </em><em>evil?</em><em> </em><em>You</em><em>’ve</em><em> killed Uriah with the </em><em>Ammonites’ </em><em>sword and took his wife to be your wife.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>he sword will never leave your </em><em>family</em><em> because </em><em>you’ve despised me by taking</em><em> </em><em>her</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I’ll raise up evil against you </em><em>in</em><em> your own </em><em>family.</em><em> I’ll take your wives in you</em><em>r presence</em><em> and give them to your neighbor</em><em>. H</em><em>e’ll lie with </em><em>them </em><em>in </em><em>broad daylight</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> did it secretly, but I’ll do it</em><em> </em><em>in front of</em><em> all Israel </em><em>right out in</em><em> the sun.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>David said, <em>“I’ve sinned against the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em> Nathan said, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has </em><em>set</em><em> you</em><em>r</em><em> sin</em><em> aside</em><em>; you won’t die.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>But by doing this</em><em>,</em><em> you’</em><em>ve completely scorned him.

### a The LORD struck the child, and it got sick. 16David asked God for the child and fasted. He went in and lay all night on the floor. 17The elders in his palace stood beside him, trying to get him up off the floor. But he wouldn’t get up and didn’t eat with them. 18The seventh day, the baby died. David’s advisors were afraid to tell him. They said, “While the child was still alive, we talked to him and he didn’t listen. How can we tell him the child has died? He may harm himself.” 19But when he saw them whispering, he sensed that the child had died, “Is he dead?” “Yes.”


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Then David got up off the floor, took a bath, anointed himself, and changed clothes. He went to the LORD’s Tabernacle and worshiped and went home. When he asked, they gave him some food and he ate. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>His advisors said,<em> “</em><em>What have you</em><em> done?</em><em> </em><em>You fasted </em><em>and cried about the child while he was alive; but when he</em><em> died, you got up and ate.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>He said, <em>“</em><em>While he</em><em> was</em><em> still alive, I fasted and cried</em><em> because I </em><em>didn’t know </em><em>if the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> w</em><em>ould</em><em> be gracious to me and </em><em>let </em><em>the child live</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>But now that he’s dead, why fast?</em><em> </em><em>Can I bring him back?</em><em> </em><em>He won’t </em><em>come back</em><em> to me, but I’ll go to him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and had relations with her. She had a son he named Solomon. The LORD loved him <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah [Beloved of the LORD] for the LORD’s sake.<strong>       </strong><strong></span>

He brought large amounts of spoil out of the city. 31He also brought out its people, and put them under saws, iron picks and axes; and made them pass through the brick kilns. That’s what he did to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the whole army went back to Jerusalem.	  2 Sam 12:26-31 Amnon and Tamar
