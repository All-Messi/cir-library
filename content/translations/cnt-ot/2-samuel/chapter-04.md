## 2 Samuel Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When Ish-bosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed, and Israel lost courage too. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Saul’s son had two men that were commanding raiding bands: Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon, a Benjamite from Beeroth (considered part of Benjamin). <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and still live there as foreigners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Jonathan had a son Mephibosheth that was lame in both feet. He was five when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried, he fell and became lame.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 4:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Baanah and Rechab left and arrived at Ish-bosheth’s house about noon while he was resting. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong><sup>LXX</sup></strong><strong><sup>┌</sup></strong>The doorkeeper had been cleaning wheat, but she got drowsy and nodded off. Rechab and Baanah slipped in,<strong><sup>┐</sup></strong> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>struck him and killed him in bed, and cut off his head. They took his head and went by way of the Arabah all night. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They brought it to David in Hebron, <em>“Her</em><em>e’</em><em>s the head of Ish-bosheth, who was trying to kill you.</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has avenged </em><em>you </em><em>on Saul and his offspring</em><em> today</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But David answered them, <em>“As </em><em>sure as </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives who has redeemed </em><em>me</em><em> </em><em>from</em><em> every adversity, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>when a man told me Saul was dead</em><em> and thought he was bringing me good news, I </em><em>seize</em><em>d him a</em><em>nd executed him at Ziklag. That’</em><em>s the reward I gave him for his news</em><em>! </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>How </em><em>much more when bad men kill</em><em> a </em><em>good</em><em> man in his own house </em><em>in bed! Won’t I </em><em>require his blood from you </em><em>now </em><em>and destroy you from the earth?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>David commanded his young men to kill them. They cut off their hands and feet, and hung them beside the pool in Hebron. But they buried Ish-bosheth’s head in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.</span>
