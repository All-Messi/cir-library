## 2 Samuel Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A long war had gone on between Saul and David. David had grown stronger; Saul had grown weaker.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>David had <em>six </em>sons in Hebron: Amnon his oldest by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Chileab second by Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel; Absalom third by Maacah daughter of Tahmai, king of Geshur; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong> Adonijah fourth by Haggith, Shephatiah fifth by Abital, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and Ithream sixth by Eglah. <strong>Abner Joins David</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>During the war between Saul and David, Abner was making himself stronger in Saul’s house. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth said, <em>“Why have you had relations with my father’s concubine?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>That made Abner mad, <em>“Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah?</em><em> </em><em>I’ve </em><em>been kind</em><em> to </em><em>your father’s</em><em> </em><em>family</em><em>, to his brothers and friends</em><em>,</em><em> and</em><em> haven’t delivered you to David. Y</em><em>et you charge me with guilt </em><em>over</em><em> this woman.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>God do so to me and more if</em><em>, </em><em>since</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has sworn to David, I don’t</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>t</em><em>ransfer the kingdom from </em><em>Saul</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>David</em><em> </em>to rule<em> Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>He couldn’t talk to Abner anymore; he was afraid of him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 3:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Abner sent messengers to David, <em>“Who does the land belong to?</em><em> </em><em>Make </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>treaty</em><em> </em><em>with me, and I’ll </em><em>bring Israel over to you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>He said, <em>“</em><em>Okay</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>I’ll make a </em><em>treaty</em><em> with you, but I demand one thing:</em><em> </em><em>you won’t see me unless you bring Michal, Saul’s daughter</em><em>,</em><em> when you come.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, <em>“Give me my wife Michal that I was engaged to for </em><em>100 </em><em>Philistine foreskins.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But her husband went crying as he followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said, <em>“Go</em><em> </em><em>back”</em>; so he did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Abner contacted the elders in Israel, <em>“</em><em>Before,</em><em> you were looking for David to be </em><em>your </em><em>king.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Now do it!</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has </em><em>said, </em>‘<em>By my servant David I’ll save my peop</em><em>le from the Philistines and </em><em>their </em>other <em>enemies.’” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Abner talked to the Benjamites and went to tell David in Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and the House of Benjamin.<strong>	</strong></span>

### men came to David in Hebron, and David held a feast for them. 21Abner said, “Let me gather Israel to you so you’ll rule everything you desire.” David sent him away on good terms. Joab Murders Abner


<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Some of David’s troops and Joab came from a raid and brought lots of spoil, but Abner wasn’t with David in Hebron, because he’d sent him away on good terms. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When Joab and the part of the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, <em>“Abn</em><em>er came to the king, and he </em><em>sent him away</em><em> on good terms</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Joab came to the king and said, <em>“</em><em>What have you done?</em><em> </em><em>Abner came to you.</em><em> </em><em>W</em><em>hy</em><em> </em><em>send</em><em> him away already?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>You </em><em>ought to </em><em>know he cam</em><em>e to deceive you and to find out about</em><em> your </em><em>routine</em><em> and what you’re doing.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well at Sirah without David knowing it. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>When Abner came back to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to talk privately. He struck Abner in the stomach, and he died because he’d killed Joab’s brother Asahel. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>When David heard it, he said, <em>“</em><em>In the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> presence,</em><em> my kingdom </em><em>and I are not guilty</em><em> of </em><em>Abner’s</em><em> blood.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>May that fall on </em><em>Joab and his father’s </em><em>family</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>May </em><em>every</em><em> one </em><em>of them have</em><em> </em><em>running sores or leprosy</em><em>,</em><em> use crutches</em><em>,</em><em> die by the sword, or go hungry</em><em>.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Joab and Abishai killed Abner because he’d killed their brother Asahel in the skirmish at Gibeon.<strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 3:20-30</p>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>David told Joab and everybody there, <em>“Tear your clothes and </em><em>put</em><em> on </em><em>burlap;</em><em> lament </em><em>over</em><em> Abner.”</em> King David walked behind the bier. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wailed at his grave and the people cried. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He chanted a lament for Abner, <em>“Should Abner die like a fool</em><em>?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Your</em><em> hands we</em><em>re not bound</em><em> or </em><em>your</em><em> feet in stocks</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>you’ve been murdered by</em><em> </em><em>wicked men</em><em>.”</em> The people cried for him again. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>They came to persuade David to eat while it was still daylight, but David vowed, <em>“</em><em>God do so to me and </em><em>more</em><em> if I taste </em><em>anything </em><em>before </em><em>sunset</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>The people noticed, and it pleased them like everything he did. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They and all Israel understood that it hadn’t been the king’s idea to kill Abner. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>He told his officials, <em>“Don’t you know that a prince</em><em>,</em><em> a great man</em><em>,</em><em> has fallen in Israel</em><em> today</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>Even </em><em>though </em><em>I’m </em><em>anointed </em><em>as </em><em>king</em><em>, t</em><em>hese sons of Z</em><em>eruiah are too much for me. </em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> repay the</em><em> evildoer according to his evil deed!</em><em>”</em><strong>   </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
