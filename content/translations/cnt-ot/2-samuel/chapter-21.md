## 2 Samuel Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In David’s time, a famine came that lasted three years. He sought the LORD. The LORD said, <em>“It’s </em><em>because </em><em>Saul and his bloody </em><em>family murdered</em><em> the</em><em> people in</em><em> Gibeon.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> (The inhabitants of Gibeon weren’t part of Israel but a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a treaty with them, but Saul had intended to kill them off in his zeal for Israel and Judah.) The king called them, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>How can I </em><em>make a</em><em>mends</em><em> </em><em>to you </em><em>so you can bless the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> inheritance</em><em> again</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>It’s not a matter of</em><em> silver or gold </em><em>between us and Saul or his family. I</em><em>t’s not for us to put anybody to death in Israel.”</em> <em>“I’ll do whatever you say.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>They told him, <em>“Give us seven descendants of the man </em><em>that </em><em>tried to destroy</em><em> us and eliminate us from staying </em><em>inside</em><em> </em><em>Israel’s border. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>e’</em><em>ll hang</em><em> them </em><em>in </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> presence</em><em> in Gibeah of Saul, the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> </em><em>chosen </em><em>one</em><em>.”</em> <em>“I’ll give them</em><em> </em>to you<em>.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>But the king spared Mephibosheth because of the LORD’s oath between David and Saul’s son Jonathan. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The king took Armoni and Mephibosheth [Merib-baal], the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah; and the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab that she had for Adriel son of Barzillai of Meholah. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He gave them to the Gibeonites, who hanged them on the mountain in the LORD’s presence. All seven died together at the beginning of barley harvest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Rizpah spread burlap on the rock, from the beginning of harvest till it rained on them. She wouldn’t let birds get to them during the day or wild animals at night. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When David found out what Saul’s concubine had done, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>he took Saul and Jonathan’s bones away from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had taken them from the open square in Beth-shan. That’s where the Philistines had hung them the day they struck Saul down in Gilboa. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He brought their bones and the bones of the ones they hanged. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He buried Saul and Jonathan’s bones in the country of Benjamin in Zela in the grave of Kish, <em>Saul’s</em> father. They did everything the king commanded. After that, God was moved by petition for the land.</span>

### Wars with the Philistine Giants


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The Philistines were at war again with Israel. When David and his men went down and fought them, David got tired. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><u>Ishbi-benob</u>, a descendant of the giants <em>in Gath</em>—whose spearhead we</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>There was war again with the Philistines at Gob. Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down <u>Saph</u>, a descendant of the giants <em>in Gath</em>. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Another war with the Philistines took place at Gob. Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim from Bethlehemite killed <em><u>Lahmi</u></em><em>, the brother of</em> Goliath of Gath, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In another war at Gath, there was <u>a </u><u>very big </u><u>man</u> with six digits on each hand and foot. He, too, was a descendant of the giants <em>in Gath</em>. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When he defied Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimei, struck him down. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Those four sons of the giants in Gath fell by David and his troops.<strong>	 </strong></span>
