## 2 Samuel Chapter **19**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then Joab heard, <em>“The king is crying and mourning for Absalom.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The victory that day turned into mourning because those who heard about it said, <em>“The ki</em><em>ng is grieving</em><em> for his son.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So the people slipped into the city like humiliated people sneak away from battle. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The king covered his face and cried out, <em>“</em><em>Absalom! My son! M</em><em>y son!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then Joab went into the house and told the king, <em>“</em><em>Y</em><em>ou’ve </em><em>shamed</em><em> your </em><em>men today.</em><em> </em><em>They’</em><em>ve saved your life</em><em>,</em><em> the lives of your sons and daughters, your wives</em><em> </em><em>and concubines</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>By loving the ones</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> hate you an</em><em>d hating the ones that love you, y</em><em>ou’ve shown that </em><em>officers</em><em> and </em><em>troops</em><em> don’t mean anything to you.</em><em> </em><em>If </em><em>Absalom was</em><em> alive and all of us dead, you’d be pleased.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>G</em><em>et up</em><em>;</em><em> go speak </em><em>gracious</em><em>ly to them.</em><em> </em><em>I swear by the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, if you don’t, not a man will </em><em>spend</em><em> the night with y</em><em>ou. T</em><em>his will be worse than all the </em><em>bad things</em><em> that</em><em> have</em><em> come on you </em><em>since you were young</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 19:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The king got up and sat in the gate. When they told the people, <em>“The king is sitting in the gate,”</em> they went to him. The Israelites that followed Absalom had fled home, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and the people were quarreling throughout the tribes, <em>“The king delivered us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>But </em><em>Absalom that we anointed has died in battle.</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>be</em><em> silent about bringing </em><em>David</em><em> back</em><em> as our king as our king</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, <em>“Say to the elders in</em><em> Judah, ‘Why are you the last to</em><em> bring the king back to his palac</em><em>e, since the word of all Israel h</em><em>as come to the king and to his hous</em><em>e?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>You’re my </em><em>kin</em><em>, my flesh and bone.</em><em> </em><em>Why then </em><em>are</em><em> you the last to </em><em>welcome him </em><em>back</em><em>?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Tell </em><em>Amasa</em><em>, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and bone</em><em>?</em><em> God do so to me and </em><em>more if you </em><em>won’t</em><em> command</em><em> my</em><em> army continually in place of Joab.’”</em><em> </em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He convinced the people in Judah to agree; they sent word for the king and the ones with him to come back.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### David Returns to Jerusalem


<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The king started back and got as far as the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet David. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>1,000 Benjamites came with him, with Ziba the steward of Saul’s household, and Ziba’s</span>

### sons and 20 servants. They rushed to the Jordan ahead of the king. 18They kept going back and forth across the ford to escort the king’s household over and do what pleased him. Shimei fell down to him as he was about to cross the Jordan, 19“Forgive me. Don’t take to heart what I did when you were leaving Jerusalem. 20 I know I’ve sinned; I’ve come down, the first from the House of Joseph, to meet you.”


<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>But Abishai son of Zeruiah answered, <em>“Shouldn’t </em><em>we</em><em> put </em><em>him </em><em>to death for cu</em><em>rsing</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s anointed?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>David said, <em>“What </em><em>do I </em><em>have to do with you</em><em> </em><em>that you</em><em> should disagree with </em><em>me?</em><em> </em><em>Should any man be put to death in Israel today?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t </em><em>I </em><em>know I’m king?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>He swore to Shimei, <em>“</em><em>You</em><em> won’t die.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 19:15-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then Saul’s son Mephibosheth came down to meet the king. He hadn’t taken care of his feet, trimmed his mustache, or washed his clothes since <em>David</em> left. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, <em>“Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He answered, <em>“My lord the king, my servant deceived me.</em><em> </em><em>I said, ‘I’ll saddle a donkey so I can go with the king,’ because</em><em> I’m </em><em>lame.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>H</em><em>e slandered </em><em>me </em><em>to</em><em> you</em><em>, but </em><em>you’re like an angel of God. D</em><em>o what </em><em>you think’</em><em>s right.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>All my father’s </em><em>family</em><em> was nothing but dead men; yet you set </em><em>me </em><em>among the ones that ate at your own table.</em><em> </em><em>What right do I have </em><em>to </em><em>complain?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The king said, <em>“Why </em><em>are</em><em> you still </em><em>talking about</em><em> your affairs?</em><em> </em><em>I’ve decided</em><em> that y</em><em>ou and Ziba will divide the land.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Mephibosheth said, <em>“</em><em>Let him hav</em><em>e it all since</em><em> you’ve </em><em>come </em><em>home safely</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 19:24-30</p>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim and went on with the king to escort him across the Jordan. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>He was old, and he’d sustained the king while he was staying at Mahanaim because he was a really wealthy man. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The king told Barzillai, <em>“Cross over with me</em><em>,</em><em> and I’ll take care of you in Jerusalem.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But he said, <em>“How long </em><em>do I have left </em><em>to live that I should go up with</em><em> you </em><em>to Jerusalem?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>I’m </em><em>80</em><em> years old.</em><em> </em><em>Can I dis</em><em>tinguish good from</em><em> bad, or taste what I eat, or </em><em>still </em><em>hear men and women singing?</em><em> </em><em>Why should I be an added burden to</em><em> you</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>I’d </em><em>simply be crossing over the Jordan with</em><em> you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Why should</em><em> you</em><em> compensate me with this reward?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>Let me go back so I can die in my own </em><em>town</em><em> near my </em><em>parents’ grave</em><em>.</em><em> But here is my son Kimham. L</em><em>et him cross over with</em><em> you</em><em>, and you can do for him what seems good.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 19:31-37</p>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>The king answered, <em>“Chimham will cross over with me, and I’ll do for </em><em>him what seems good to you and</em><em> </em><em>w</em><em>hatever you </em><em>need</em><em> me </em><em>to do for </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>The king and the people crossed the Jordan. He kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he went back home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>The king and Chimham went on to Gilgal. Judah and half of Israel crossed with the king. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>The men from Israel came to the king and said, <em>“</em><em>Why di</em><em>d our </em><em>fellow Jews</em><em> </em><em>in</em><em> Judah st</em><em>eal</em><em> you away, and br</em><em>ing</em><em> </em><em>you,</em><em> </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em>family,</em><em> and </em><em>your</em><em> men </em><em>across</em><em> the Jordan?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>Then the men from Judah answered, <em>“Because the king is a close relative to us.</em><em> </em><em>W</em><em>hy are you mad about that</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Have we eaten at all at the kings’ expense, or has anything been taken for us?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>But the men of Israel said, <em>“</em><em>We have ten parts in the king, so</em><em> we have more claim on David than you do.</em><em> </em><em>Why then did you </em><em>dishonor us</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Wasn’t it our advice first to bring </em><em>him </em><em>back?”</em> Yet the men from Judah were more adamant than the men of Israel.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
