### Chronicles 11:11], chief of The Three. He was called Adino the Eznite because he killed 800 men in one battle.


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>After him was <strong>Eleazar</strong> son of Dodo, a descendant of Ahoah, another of The Three elite soldiers. He and David defied the Philistines that gathered for battle and Israel’s army retreated. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He arose and struck the Philistines till his hand was worn out and cramped onto the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The rest of the army only returned to strip <em>the slain</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>After him was <strong>Shammah</strong> son of Agee, from Harar. The Philistines had gathered into a troop on a plot of ground full of lentils, and the rest of the Israelite army had fled. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and struck the Philistines. The LORD brought about a great victory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Then The Three among The Thirty chief men went down to David at harvest time to the cave near Adullam, while a troop of Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>David was in the stronghold while the garrison of Philistines was in Bethlehem. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>David had a yearning, <em>“If only somebody would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem by the gate!”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So The Three broke through the Philistines’ camp and drew water from the well and brought it to him. But he wouldn’t drink it. He poured it out to the LORD, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“I couldn’t do that</em><em>, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em><em> Am</em><em> I </em><em>going to </em><em>drink t</em><em>he blood of men who jeopardized</em><em> their lives?”</em> Those are some things The Three most elite soldiers did.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Then <strong>Benaiah</strong> son of Jehoiada—son of a great warrior from Kabzeel, who had done amazing things—killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but <em>Benaiah</em> went down to him with a club and took the spear away from him and killed him with it. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He had a name as well as The Three. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He was honored among The Thirty, but he didn’t measure up to The Three.
