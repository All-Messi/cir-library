## 2 Samuel Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> David's last words</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The God of Israel said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Is not my family that way with God?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But godless people every one will be thrown aside like briers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> If you touch them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> These are David's most elite soldiers: Josheb-basshebeth, a Tahchemonite [a Hachmonite in 1 Chronicles 11:11], chief of The Three. He was called Adino the Eznite because he killed 800 men in one battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, a descendant of Ahoah, another of The Three elite soldiers. He and David defied the Philistines that gathered for battle and Israel's army retreated. 10He arose and struck the Philistines till his hand was worn out and cramped onto the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The rest of the army only returned to strip the slain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> After him was Shammah son of Agee, from Harar. The Philistines had gathered into a troop on a plot of ground full of lentils, and the rest of the Israelite army had fled. 12But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and struck the Philistines. The LORD brought about a great victory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then The Three among The Thirty chief men went down to David at harvest time to the cave near Adullam, while a troop of Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. 14David was in the stronghold while the garrison of Philistines was in Bethlehem. 15David had a yearning, "If only somebody would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem by the gate!" 16So The Three broke through the Philistines' camp and drew water from the well and brought it to him. But he wouldn't drink it. He poured it out to the LORD, 17"I couldn't do that, LORD. Am I going to drink the blood of men who jeopardized their lives?" Those are some things The Three most elite soldiers did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Abishai, brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was chief of The Thirty. He handled his spear against 300 and killed them and had a name alongside The Three. 19He was the most honored of The Thirty, so he became their commander, but he didn't measure up to The Three.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada—son of a great warrior from Kabzeel, who had done amazing things—killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day. 21He killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a club and took the spear away from him and killed him with it. 22He had a name as well as The Three. 23He was honored among The Thirty, but he didn't measure up to The Three. David appointed him over his guard.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Asahel, Joab's brother, was among the 30 as well as</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Shammah and Elika from Harod,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Helez from Pelon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abiezer from Anathoth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Zalmon from Ahoah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Benaiah from Pirathon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Abialbon/Abiel?LXX from Arabah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Eliahba from Shaalbon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Eliphelet son of Ahasbai from Maacah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Hezro from Carmel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Igal son of Nathan from Zobah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Zelek from Ammon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Ira and Gareb the Jattir,</span>
