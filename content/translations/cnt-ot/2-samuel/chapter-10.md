## 2 Samuel Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>David said, <em>“I’ll </em><em>be kind</em><em> to Hanun </em><em>son of Nahash like</em><em> his father </em><em>was kind</em><em> to me.”</em><em> </em>David sent some ambassadors to console him about his father. But when they got there, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, <em>“Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent consolers?</em><em> </em><em>Hasn’t he sent them to </em><em>look over</em><em> the city, spy it out</em><em>,</em><em> and overthrow it?”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Hanun took David’s ambassadors and shaved off half their beards, cut off their cloaks as high as their hips, and sent them away. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When David found out, he sent to meet them because they were really humiliated. He told <em>them</em> to stay at Jericho till their beards grew, and then come back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>When the Ammonites saw they’d become repugnant to David, they hired the Arameans from Beth-rehob and Zobah</span>

### ,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob with 12,000 men. 7David heard about it, and sent Joab and the whole army, the powerful men. 8The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to the city. The Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field.	 2 Sam 10:1-8


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>When Joab saw he’d have to fight front and in back, he selected elite men from Israel, and deployed them against the Arameans. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The rest he put under the command of his brother Abishai against the Ammonites, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“If the Arame</em><em>ans are too strong for me, </em><em>come and help me. I</em><em>f </em><em>the </em><em>Ammon</em><em>ites</em><em> are too strong for you, I’ll come </em><em>and </em><em>help you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Let’s be strong and</em><em> </em><em>courageous for our people and </em><em>the </em><em>towns</em><em> of </em><em>our God. May the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> do what</em><em> </em><em>seems </em><em>good </em><em>to</em><em> hi</em><em>m</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Joab and his people advanced against the Arameans, and they ran. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When the Ammonites saw them flee, they retreated into the city. Then Joab came back from fighting Ammon’s descendants and went to Jerusalem.<strong>	   </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>When the Arameans saw that Israel had defeated them, they gathered together. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Hadadezer brought out the Arameans beyond the River and came to Helam. Shobach, commander of Hadadezer’s army, led them. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>David found out and gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan to Helam. The Arameans put themselves in battle formation, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>but they fled from Israel. David k</span>
