## 2 Samuel Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Absalom provided himself a chariot, horses, and 50 men to run ahead of him. 2He'd get up early and stand by the road to the gate. When anybody had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then Absalom would say, "Your claims are right, but everybody with the king is ignoring you. 4If only somebody would appoint me judge in the land, everyone that has a suit could come to me for justice."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When somebody came near to prostrate himself before him, he'd put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. 6That's how he dealt with everyone in Israel that came to the king for judgment. He stole away the hearts of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, "Let me go pay the vow I made to the LORD in Hebron. 8I took a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram that if the LORD brought me back to Jerusalem, I'd serve him." He went to Hebron. 10But he sent spies throughout the tribes, and said, "As soon as you hear the ram's horn, say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron!'" 11Then 200 men went with him from Jerusalem. They went innocently, not knowing what was going on. 12Absalom sent for Ahithophel, David's advisor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices. The conspiracy was growing strong; the people continually increased with Absalom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then a messenger came to David, "The hearts of Israel are with Absalom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> David told his aides in Jerusalem, "Let's flee. Otherwise, none of us will escape from him. Hurry so he won't overtake us right away, bring down catastrophe on us, and strike the city with the sword."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The king's aides told him, "We're ready to do whatever you decide."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So he and his whole family left except for 10 concubines to take care of the palace. 17He and the people with him went out and stopped at the last house. 18His aides passed on beside him, the Cherethites, Pelethites, and the men of Gath. The 600 men that had come with him from Gath passed on ahead of him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The king said to Ittai of Gath, "Why go with us? Go back to King Absalom. You're a foreigner and an exile; go back to your place. 20You just came yesterday; will I make you wander with us today while I don't know where I'm going? Go back and take your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But Ittai answered, "As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I'll be wherever you are, for life or death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So David said, "Go on across." So Ittai crossed with his people and little ones. 23While the whole country cried out loud, the people passed over. The king and the people crossed the Kidron toward the countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Zadok and the Levites with him came carrying the Ark of the covenant. They set it down, and Abiathar came up till the people had finished leaving the city. 25The king told Zadok, "Take the Ark back to the city. If I'm pleasing to the LORD, he'll bring me back and show me it and his dwelling place. 26But if he doesn't delight in me, here I am. Let him do to me what seems good to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He also said to Zadok, "Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, you and yourpl two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of Abiathar. 28I'll wait at the fords in the open country till you send me word."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark back to Jerusalem and stayed there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> David went up the Mount of Olives and cried as he went. He covered his head and walked barefoot. Then the people that were with him covered their heads and went up crying as they went. 31Someone told David, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." David said, "LORD, turn Ahithophel's advice into foolishness." 32As David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn and dust on his head. 33David told him, "If you pass over with me, you'll be a burden to me. 34But if you go back to the city and tell Absalom, 'I'll serve you, king, like I served your father,' you can thwart Ahithophel's advice for me. 35Whatever you hear from the king's palace, report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36Their two sons are with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son; and Jonathan, Abiathar's son. Use them to send me everything you hear."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Hushai, David's personal advisor, went into the city as Absalom got to Jerusalem.</span>
