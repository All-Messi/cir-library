## 2 Samuel Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then David counted his people and set over them commanders of thousands and hundreds. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He sent out the troops, a third each under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. He told them, <em>“I’ll go out with you too.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They said, <em>“</em><em>You shouldn’t go out.</em><em> </em><em>If we </em><em>flee</em><em>, they won’t care even if half of us die.</em><em> Y</em><em>ou’re worth </em><em>10,000 of us. I</em><em>t’s better </em><em>for</em><em> you </em><em>to </em><em>be ready to help us from </em><em>town</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>He said, <em>“I’ll do what</em><em> </em><em>you think’s </em><em>best.”</em><em> </em>He stood beside the gate, and the troops went out by hundreds and thousands. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He charged Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, <em>“</em><em>F</em><em>or my sa</em><em>ke, d</em><em>eal gently </em><em>with young Absalom.” </em>The troops heard it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>The troops went out, and the battle took place in the Forest of Ephraim. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>David’s men defeated the people of Israel with a great slaughter—20,000 men. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and more people died because of the forest than died from the sword.<strong> </strong><strong>	     </strong> <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Sam 18:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Absalom happened to meet <em>some of</em> David’s men. He was trying to escape on his mule, and it went under the thick branches of a big terebinth tree. His hair got tangled up in them and left him hanging as the mule kept going. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>One fellow told Joab, <em>“I saw Absalom hanging </em><em>from</em><em> a</em><em> terebinth</em><em> tree.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Joab said, <em>“You saw him!</em><em> </em><em>Why didn’t you strik</em><em>e him to the ground? I would’</em><em>ve given you </em><em>10</em><em> pieces of silver and a belt.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>The man said, <em>“Even if </em><em>you’d given me</em><em> </em><em>1,000, I wouldn’t</em><em> </em><em>have attacked the king’s son. He </em><em>charged you, Abishai</em><em>,</em><em> and Ittai</em><em> for his sake to p</em><em>rotect young Absalom!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Otherwise</em><em>, if I</em><em>’d have</em><em> dealt </em><em>devi</em><em>ously </em><em>with</em><em> him (</em><em>and there’s nothing hidden from the king</em><em>)</em><em>, y</em><em>ou wouldn’t ha</em><em>ve </em><em>gotten involved</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Joab said, <em>“</em><em>I’</em><em>m not wasting</em><em> time here with you.”</em> He took three spears and thrust them through Absalom’s heart while he was still alive in the tree. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Ten young men that carried Joab’s armor gathered around Absalom and killed him.<strong>	   </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his troops came back from chasing Israel. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They threw Absalom in a deep pit in the forest and piled a big mound of rocks over him. Israel fled home. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Absalom had set up a marker in the King’s Valley. He said, <em>“I don’t have a son to </em><em>carry on</em><em> my name.”</em><em> </em>So he named the marker after himself; it’s still called Absalom’s Monument. <strong>David Mourns</strong><strong> Absalom’s Death</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Then Ahimaaz said, <em>“Let me run </em><em>to </em><em>the king</em><em> with</em><em> the news that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has freed him from his enemies.”</em><em>     </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Joab told him, <em>“You’re not the </em><em>one</em><em> to carry </em><em>news today. Y</em><em>ou’ll carry it a</em><em>nother day. T</em><em>he king’s son is dead.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Joab told the Nubian, <em>“Go</em><em> tell </em><em>him</em><em> what you’ve seen.”</em> He bowed to Joab and ran.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ahimaaz said again, <em>“W</em><em>hatever happens, let me run </em><em>too</em><em>.”</em> Joab said, <em>“Why would you run,</em><em> </em><em>son, since you</em><em> won’t get anything </em><em>for </em><em>it</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Whatever happens, I’ll run.”</em> <em>“Go ahead.”</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>

### a 	Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Nubian. 24David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town. The watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and saw a man running by himself. 25He called it out to the king. He said, “If he’s by himself, he has good news.”  He came closer and closer. 26Then the watchman saw another man running. He called to the gatekeeper, “There’s another man running by himself.”  	The king said, “That one is bringing good news too.”


<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The watchman said, <em>“The first runner looks </em><em>like Ahimaaz.”</em> The king said, <em>“He’s a good man</em><em>,</em><em> bringing good news.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Ahimaaz called out to the king, <em>“All</em><em>’</em><em>s well.”</em> He prostrated himself to the king. <em>“Blessed is the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God, who has delivered up the </em><em>rebels</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“Is Absalom</em><em> all right</em><em>?”</em> Ahimaaz answered, <em>“When Joab sent the king’s servant and </em><em>me</em><em>, I saw</em><em> a big great disturbance</em><em>, but I didn’t know what was going on.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The king said, <em>“</em><em>Come over and</em><em> stand here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The Nubian arrived and said, <em>“</em><em>R</em><em>eceive good news</em><em>. The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has freed you to</em><em>day from </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em>attackers</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>“Is Absalom</em><em> all right</em><em>?”</em> The Nubian answered, <em>“Let everyone</em><em> who </em><em>opposes you be like</em><em> that young man!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>The king was deeply moved and went up to the room above the gate and cried. He said as he walked, <em>“Absalom! My son! M</em><em>y son Absalom!</em><em> Oh that</em><em> I’d </em><em>have died instead of you, Absalom! My son! M</em><em>y son!”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
