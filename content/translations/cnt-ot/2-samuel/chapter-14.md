## 2 Samuel Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joab sensed that the king yearned for Absalom. 2So he sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman, and told her, "Act like you're in mourning. Put on mourning clothes, don't anoint yourself with oil. Act like a woman that's been mourning for the dead for many days. 3Then go to the king and say such and such."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When she spoke to the king, she fell on her face and said, "Help me, my king." "I'm a widow; my husband's dead. 6I had two sons, but they quarreled in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. 7Now the whole family has risen up and told me to hand over the one that struck his brother so they can put him to death for the life of his brother, and destroy the heir too. They'll put out my ember that's left and won't leave my husband a name or a remnant."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The woman said, "My lord, the sin is on me and my father's family. You and your throne are innocent."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He said, "Bring me whoever says anything. He won't bother you again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> She said, "Invoke the LORD your God so the avenger won't destroy my son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then she said, "Let me say something." 13"Why plan such a thing then against God's people? In saying this, you've convicted yourself for not bringing back the one you've banished. 14We'll die like water spilled on the ground that can't be retrieved. Yet God doesn't take away life but plans ways to bring back the one he banishes. 15I've come to you because the people have made me afraid. I thought, 'I'll speak to the king. Maybe he'll do what I ask. 16He'll deliver me from the man that would destroy me and my son from God's inheritance.' 17Then I thought, 'My lord's word will comfort me, because he's like an angel of God in discerning good and bad.' The LORD your God be with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He answered, "Don't hide anything I'm about to ask you. 19Is Joab involved in this with you?" "As sure as you're alive, nobody can stray away from anything you've said. Joab told me to say that. 20He did it to change how things are going. But you are wise, like an angel of God. You know what's going on in the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The king told Joab, "I'll do it. Bring him back."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Joab fell on his face and blessed him. "I know you're pleased with me today. You've done what I asked."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24But the king said, "Have him come back to his own house without seeing me." He came back without seeing David.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> In all Israel there wasn't anybody as handsome as Absalom—so highly praised. There wasn't a flaw in him from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot. 26When he cut his hair (at the end of every year because it was so thick), he weighed it at 5 lbs 200 shekels, royal standard. 27He had three sons and one daughter, Tamar, a beautiful woman.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king. 29Then he sent for Joab so he could send him to the king, but Joab wouldn't come. He sent again and he wouldn't come. 30Absalom told his servants, "Joab's barley field is next to mine. Set it on fire."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Joab went to Absalom's house and asked, "Why did your servants burn my field?" 32"I sent for you so I could send you to ask the king why I've come back from Geshur. It'd be better for me to still be there. Let me see him. If I've sinned, he can put me to death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When Joab went to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. He came and prostrated himself, and the king kissed him.</span>
