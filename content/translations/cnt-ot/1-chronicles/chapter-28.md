## 1 Chronicles Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> David gathered to Jerusalem the officials in Israel, the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, the overseers of the property and livestock that belong to the king and his sons, the officials and elite soldiers, all the brave warriors. 2He stood up and said, "My relatives, my people, I intended to build a permanent temple for the Ark of the Covenant and for a footstool of our God; so I made preparations. 3But he told me, 'You won't build me a house; you're a soldier that's shed blood.' 4But the LORD chose me from my father's family to rule Israel permanently. He chose Judah to lead, chose my father's family in Judah, and delighted in me among my brothers. 5From my sons he's chosen Solomon to sit on the throne. (The LORD has given me many sons.) 6He told me, 'Solomon will build my temple and courts. I've chosen him to be my son, and I'll be his father. 7I'll make his kingdom permanently secure if he's resolute in keeping my commandments and ordinances, like he is today.' 8In front of Israel, in the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, endeavor to follow all his commandments so you can keep the good land and leave it for your descendants. 9"Solomon, son, know your father's God. Serve him with all your heart and a willing mind, because the LORD examines every heart and understands every intent. 10Be diligent about that because he has chosen you to build a temple for the sanctuary. Have the courage to do it."      	 1 Ch 28:1-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The details of this pattern he made clear in writing from the LORD's hand.	1 Ch 28:14-19</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then David told Solomon, "Be strong and courageous; don't be afraid or intimidated. The LORD's with you. He won't fail you or abandon you till the work is done. 21There are divisions of priests and Levites for serving in God's Temple, and every willing man with skill will be with you for all kinds of service. The officials and the people will be entirely at your command."	1 Ch 28:20-21</span>
