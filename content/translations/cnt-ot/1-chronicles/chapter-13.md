## 1 Chronicles Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then David consulted with every commander of thousands and hundreds, 2and told the whole assembly, "If it seems good to you and if the LORD our God wills, let's send around to our relatives that are still in Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites that are with them in their towns and pastures, to have them meet with us. 3Let's bring the Ark back. We neglected it in Saul's time."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The assembly agreed because it seemed right to them. 5He brought Israel together from the Shihor in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring God's Ark from Kiriath-jearim. 6He and all Israel went up to Baalah (Kiriath-jearim) on the edge of Judah to bring up God's Ark, which wears the name the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubs. 7They hauled the Ark on a new cart from Abinadab's house; Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 8David and all Israel were celebrating to God with all their energy—with songs and lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon/Nachon, Uzza reached out to steady the Ark, because the oxen stumbled. 10The LORD's anger burned against him, so he struck him down, and he died there in front of God. 11David was mad because the LORD "lashed out against Uzza," and has called the place Perez-uzza ever since. 12David was afraid of God that day, "How can I bring the Ark home to me?" 13So he didn't take it to The City of David but to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite nearby. 14It stayed with his family for three months, and the LORD blessed them and everybody he had. 	1 Ch 13:1-14</span>
