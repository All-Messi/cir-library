## 1 Chronicles Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Philistines attacked Israel, and they fled and fell dead on Mount Gilboa. 2The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons and struck down his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua. 3The battle grew intense against Saul, and the archers wounded him. 4He told his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through so these uncircumcised Philistines don't come and torture me." But his armor bearer was too afraid to do it; so Saul took his sword and fell on it. 5When his armor bearer saw he was dead, he fell on his sword too. 6So Saul's whole dynasty died together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When the Israelites in the valley saw they'd fled and Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled; the Philistines came and lived in them. 8The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons. 9They stripped him, took his head and armor, and sent messengers around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and the people. 10They put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 11When Jabesh-gilead heard what they'd done to Saul, 12brave men got up and took the bodies of Saul and his sons, buried their bones under the terebinth tree in Jabesh, and fasted a week.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So Saul died for his trespass against the LORD 14and because he inquired from a medium instead of the LORD. He killed him and turned the kingdom over to David. 	1 Ch 10:1-14</span>
