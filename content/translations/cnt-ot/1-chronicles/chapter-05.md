## 1 Chronicles Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The sons of REUBEN, Israel's firstborn: 3Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi (Because he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel; so he's not enrolled in the genealogy by birthright. 2Although Judah prevailed over his brothers and the leader came from him, the birthright was Joseph's.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The sons of Joel were Shemaiah, Gog, Shimei, 5Micah, Reaiah, Baal, 6Beerah that Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, took away into exile. He was leader in Reuben. 7His relatives by clans—when their genealogy was figured—were Jeiel the chief, then Zechariah, 8Bela son of Azaz son of Shema son of Joel that lived in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal-meon. 9He lived to the east as far as the entrance to the desert this side of the River Euphrates because their livestock had multiplied in Gilead. 10At the time of Saul, they conquered the Hagrites and occupied their tents in the whole region east of Gilead.							1 Ch 5:1-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The descendants of GAD lived across from them in Bashan as far as Salecah. 12Joel was the chief, Shapham second, then Janai and Shaphat in Bashan. 13Their kinsmen in their clans were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber—7. 14These were the descendants of Abihail son of Huri son of Jaroah son of Gilead son of Michael son of Jeshishai son of Jahdo son of Buz 15and Ahi son of Abdiel son of Guni were heads of their clans. 16The descendants of Gad lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its surrounding towns, in the pastureland of Sharon as far as their boundaries. 17These were enrolled in the genealogies at the time of Jotham, king of Judah, and JeroboamI, king of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe were 44,760—brave men who carried shield and sword, shot bow and arrow, were capable in battle. 19They fought the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. 20God helped them and delivered the Hagrites and everybody that was with them, because they cried out to God in the battle. He granted their petition because they trusted in him. 21They took their livestock: 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys, and 100,000 men. 22Many fell slain because the war came from God. They settled in their place. 23The descendants of the Manasseh half-tribe lived in the land. They were numerous from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon. 24The heads of their clans were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, trained soldiers, famous men. 25But they sinned against their ancestors' God and committed prostitution with the gods of the people in the land God had destroyed. 26The God of Israel stirred up Pul, king of Assyria—also known as Tiglath-pilneser/Tiglath-pileser—and he took Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe into exile, to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan River ever since. 		1 Ch 5:11-26</span>
