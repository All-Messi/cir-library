## 1 Chronicles Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>, </sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The sons of <strong>REUBEN</strong>, Israel’s firstborn:<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi (Because he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel; so he’s not enrolled in the genealogy by birthright. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Although Judah prevailed over his brothers and the leader came from him, the birthright was Joseph’s.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The sons of Joel <em>were </em>Shemaiah, Gog, Shimei, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Micah, Reaiah, Baal, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Beerah that Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, took away into exile. He was leader in Reuben. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>His relatives by clans—when their genealogy was figured—<em>were</em> Jeiel the chief, then Zechariah, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Bela son of Azaz son of Shema son of Joel that lived in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal-meon. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He lived to the east as far as the entrance to the desert this side of the River Euphrates because their livestock had multiplied in Gilead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>At the time of Saul, they conquered the Hagrites and occupied their tents in the whole region east of Gilead.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The descendants of <strong>GAD</strong> lived across from them in Bashan as far as Salecah. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Joel was the chief, Shapham second, then Janai and Shaphat in Bashan. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Their kinsmen in their clans <em>were</em> Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber—7. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>These <em>were</em> the descendants of Abihail son of Huri son of Jaroah son of Gilead son of Michael son of Jeshishai son of Jahdo son of Buz <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and Ahi son of Abdiel son of Guni <em>were </em>heads of their clans. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The descendants of Gad lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its surrounding towns, in the pastureland of Sharon as far as their boundaries. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>These were enrolled in the genealogies at the time of Jotham, king of Judah, and Jeroboam<strong><sup>I</sup></strong>, king of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh<em> </em>half-tribe<em> </em><em>were</em> 44,760—brave men who carried shield and sword, shot bow and arrow, were capable in battle. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>They fought the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God helped them and delivered the Hagrites and everybody that was with them, because they cried out to God in the battle. He granted their petition because they trusted in him. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They took their livestock: 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys,</span>

### ,000 men. 22Many fell slain because the war came from God. They settled in their place. 23The descendants of the Manasseh half-tribe lived in the land. They were numerous from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon. 24The heads of their clans were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, trained soldiers, famous men. 25But they sinned against their ancestors’ God and committed prostitution with the gods of the people in the land God had destroyed. 26The God of Israel stirred up Pul, king of Assyria—also known as Tiglath-pilneser/Tiglath-pileser—and he took Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe into exile, to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan River ever since. 		1 Ch 5:11-26
