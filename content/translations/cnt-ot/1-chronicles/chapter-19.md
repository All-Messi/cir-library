He sent to meet them because they were humiliated. He told them to stay in Jericho till their beards grew back; then come home.</span>

I</em><em>f the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll help you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Be</em><em> strong</em><em>; </em><em>let’s show ourselves courageous for our people and the </em><em>towns</em><em> of our Go</em><em>d.
