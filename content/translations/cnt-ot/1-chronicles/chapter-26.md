<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>To these divisions of the gatekeepers, the chief men <em>were</em> given duties like their relatives to serve in the LORD’s Temple. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>According to their families, they cast lots, without regard for age, for each gate. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The lot for the east <em>gate</em> fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his son Zechariah, an advisor with insight; his lot came out for the north <em>gate.</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Obed-edom’s<em> lot fell</em> for the south; the storehouse went to his sons. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>For Shuppim and Hosah <em>the lot fell </em>for the west <em>gate</em>, by Shallecheth’s gate on the ascending highway. Guard corresponded to guard. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>There were six Levites on the east, four on the north and south each day, and at the storehouse two and two. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>At the Parbar on the west <em>there were</em> four at the highway and two at the Parbar. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Those are the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of Korah and Merari.<strong>	 </strong></span>
