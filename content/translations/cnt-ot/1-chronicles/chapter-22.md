## 1 Chronicles Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ch 22:6-16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> David issued an order to gather the foreigners in Israel and set stonecutters to dress stones for God's Temple. 3He provided large stores of iron for making nails for the doors in the gates and for clamps, more bronze than could be weighed, 4and cedar logs without number. The Sidonians and Tyrians brought him large supplies of cedar timber. 5He said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the LORD's Temple will be magnificent, famous, and glorious all over the world. I'll stockpile materials for it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then he called Solomon and charged him to build a temple for the LORD God of Israel, 7"Son, I intended to build a temple for the LORD, 8but his message came to me, 'You won't build me a temple; you've shed so much blood and fought great wars. 9You'll have a son that's not a military figure. I'll give him rest from his enemies everywhere. His name will be Solomon because I'll give Israel 'peace' and quiet during his life. 10He'll build a temple for me. He'll be my son, and I'll be his father. I'll make his kingdom permanently secure.' 11The LORD be with you so you can succeed at building it. 12May he give you discretion and intelligence, and give you charge over Israel so you can keep his Law. 13You'll prosper if you observe carefully the statutes and ordinances he commanded Moses. Be strong and courageous; don't be afraid or intimidated. 14I've taken great pains to stockpile materials: 3775 tons 100,000 talents of gold, 37,750 tons 1,000,000 talents of silver, bronze and iron past weighing, timber, and stone. You can add to that. 15You have lots of stonecutters, stonemasons, and carpenters skilled in all kinds of work. 16There's no limit to the gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Get started. The LORD be with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He directed Israel's leaders to help Solomon, 18"Isn't the LORD with you? Hasn't he given you rest in every direction? He's delivered to you the nations in the land, and it's under control. 19Set your heart and soul to look to him. Build his sanctuary so you can bring the Ark and God's holy articles into it."	1 Ch 22:17-19</span>
