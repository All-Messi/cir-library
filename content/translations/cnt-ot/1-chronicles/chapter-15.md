## 1 Chronicles Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ch 15:1-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests and for the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 12"You're heads of families among the Levites. Consecrate yourselves and your relatives so you can bring the Ark up to the place I've prepared. 13You didn't carry it the first time, so the LORD lashed out on us; we didn't look to him according to the ordinance."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the Ark. 15The Levites carried it on their shoulders, with the poles on it like Moses had commanded by the LORD's message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> David told the chiefs among the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers and the ones with musical instruments—harps, lyres, loud cymbals—to make joyful music. 17The Levites appointed Heman son of Joel and his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah from the descendants of Merari their relatives. 18The Levites appointed with them their relatives of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. 19The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to sound loud bronze cymbals. 20Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth. 21Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres pitched to The Sheminith. 22Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing. He taught singing because he was good at it. 23Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the Ark. 24Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests blew bugles ahead of the Ark. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also gatekeepers for the Ark.   1 Ch 15:16-24</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> David, with the elders in Israel and the commanders of thousands, went to bring up the Ark from Obed-edom's house with joy. 26Because God was helping the Levites that were carrying the Ark, they sacrificed 7 bulls and 7 rams. 27David dressed in a fine linen robe with the Levites that were carrying the Ark, the singers, and Chenaniah, who led the singing. David also wore a linen ephod. 28Israel brought up the Ark with shouting, blowing rams' horns and trumpets, crashing cymbals, and playing harps and lyres. 29When the Ark came to The City of David, Saul's daughter Michal looked out the window, and saw King David dancing and celebrating; and she despised him.	1 Ch 15:25-29</span>
