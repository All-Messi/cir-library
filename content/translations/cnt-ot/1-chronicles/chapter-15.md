<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>David told the chiefs among the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers and the ones with musical instruments—harps, lyres, loud cymbals—to make joyful music. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The Levites appointed Heman son of Joel and his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah from the descendants of Merari their relatives. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Levites appointed</em> with them their relatives of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to sound loud bronze cymbals. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres pitched to <em>The Sheminith</em>. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing. He taught singing because he was good at it. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the Ark. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests blew bugles ahead of the Ark.

David also wore a linen ephod. 28Israel brought up the Ark with shouting, blowing rams’ horns and trumpets, crashing cymbals, and playing harps and lyres. 29When the Ark came to The City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked out the window, and saw King David dancing and celebrating; and she despised him.	1 Ch 15:25-29
