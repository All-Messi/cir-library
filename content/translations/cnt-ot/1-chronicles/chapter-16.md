## 1 Chronicles Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>They put the Ark in the tent David had pitched for it and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When David had finished offering them, he blessed the people in the LORD’s name. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>To every man and woman in Israel, he passed out a loaf of bread, a helping of meat, and a raisin cake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>He appointed some Levites to serve at the Ark—to celebrate, thank, and praise the LORD God of Israel: <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Asaph the chief, second to him Zechariah, <em>then</em> Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel with musical instruments—harps and lyres. Asaph played the loud cymbals; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew bugles constantly in front of the Ark.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>That day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to the LORD.</span>
