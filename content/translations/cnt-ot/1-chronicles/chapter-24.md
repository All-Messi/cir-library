## 1 Chronicles Chapter **24**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>T</em><em>hese</em><em> were </em>the divisions of Aaron’s descendants. His sons <em>were</em> Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they didn’t have any sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>David—with Zadok from Eleazar’s descendants and Ahimelech from Ithamar’s descendants—divided them by their offices for their service. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Since there were more chief men descended from Eleazar than from Ithamar, they divided them into<em> </em>16 heads descended from Eleazar</span>
<p class="section-ref">and 8</p>

### from Ithamar. 5They divided them alike by lot because they were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God. 6Shemaiah son of Nethanel the secretary from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the families among the priests and Levites—one family taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar. 		1 Ch 24:1-6
