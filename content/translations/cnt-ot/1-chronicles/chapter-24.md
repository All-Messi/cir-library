## 1 Chronicles Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> These were the divisions of Aaron's descendants. His sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they didn't have any sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 3David—with Zadok from Eleazar's descendants and Ahimelech from Ithamar's descendants—divided them by their offices for their service. 4Since there were more chief men descended from Eleazar than from Ithamar, they divided them into 16 heads descended from Eleazar and 8 from Ithamar. 5They divided them alike by lot because they were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God. 6Shemaiah son of Nethanel the secretary from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the families among the priests and Levites—one family taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar. 		1 Ch 24:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The first lot came out for Jehoiarib,	the second for Jedaiah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Those were their officers for ministry when they came to the LORD's Temple according to the ordinance Aaron their ancestor gave them by the LORD God's command.     	1 Ch 24:7-19</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now about the rest of Levi's descendants: 23the descendants of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, Jekameam fourth.  	1 Ch 24:20-23 Those were the Levites by families. 31They also cast lots—the head of each family and his younger brother alike—like their relatives the descendants of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families among the priests and Levites.	1 Ch 24:24-31</span>
