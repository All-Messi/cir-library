## 1 Chronicles Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Israel gathered to David in Hebron, "We're your flesh and bone. 2When Saul was king, you led out and brought in Israel. The LORD your God said you would shepherd his people and be their leader."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The elders in Israel came to him, and he made a treaty with them in the LORD's presence. They anointed him king according to the LORD's message through Samuel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (Jebus). The Jebusites, natives in the land, lived there. 5They told David, "You won't get in here"; but he captured the fortress of Zion (The City of David). 6He had said, "Whoever strikes down the Jebusites first will be general of the army." Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became the general. 7David lived in the fortress; so they called it The City of David. 8He built the city all around from the Millo to the surrounding area, and Joab repaired the rest of Jerusalem. 9David became greater and greater because the LORD was with him.	       1 Ch 11:1-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> These are David's leading powerful warriors, who greatly supported him in his kingdom, along with all Israel, in making him king. 11They were Jashobeam son of a Hachmonite, chief of the 30. He killed 300 men with his spear at one time. 12After him was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three powerful men. 13He was with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines converged there for battle. There was a barley field, and the people were running from the Philistines. 14They took their stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. The LORD gave them a great victory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Three of the 30 chief men went down to the rock to David into the cave near Adullam while the Philistine army was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. 16Davd was in the stronghold while the Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem. 17David was thirsty and said, "Oh that somebody would give me a drink from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!" 18The three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at Bethlehem and took it to David. But he wouldn't drink it; he poured it out to the LORD. 19"In the presence of my God, I can't do that. Should I, in effect, drink these men's blood who risked their lives to bring it?" Those were exploits the three powerful men did.	1 Ch 11:10-19</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Abishai, Joab's brother, was leader of the 30. He killed 300 with a spear; he had a reputation as well as the 30. 21Of the three in the second rank, he had the greatest honor and became their commander. But he didn't measure up to the three.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Benaiah son of Jehoiada, son of a fearless warrior from Kabzeel, powerful in deeds, struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day. 23He killed an Egyptian that was 7ft 6. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from him and killed him with it.   24-25Benaiah was renowned among the 30, but he didn't measure up to the three. David appointed him over his guard.	1 Ch 11:20-25</span>
