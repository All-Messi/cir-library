## 1 Chronicles Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ch 17:15-27</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Nathan said, "Do what's in your mind. God is with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> That same night, the message from God came to him, 4"Go tell my servant David, 'The LORD says, "You're not to build me a temple. 5I haven't lived in a temple since I brought Israel up. I've gone from tent to tent and place to place. 6In all the places where I've lived with Israel, have I asked any judge that I've commanded to shepherd my people why he hasn't built me a cedar temple?"' 7Tell David, 'The LORD of Hosts says, "I took you out of the pasture from behind sheep and made you a leader over Israel. 8I've been with you wherever you've gone and removed your enemies from you. I'll make you as famous as anyone that's ever lived in the world. 9I'll appoint you a place for my people, and plant them so they won't have to move anymore. Sinful people won't lay waste to them like they did before, 10including the time I put judges over them. I'll subdue your enemies and build you a dynasty. 11When your life's over and you've gone to your ancestors, I'll set up one of your sons and secure his throne permanently. 12He'll build me a temple. 13I'll be his father, and he'll be my son. I won't take my enduring love away from him like I did with your predecessor. 14I'll settle him in my house and kingdom permanently."'"	  1 Ch 17:1-14</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Nathan told David everything in his vision.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then David went in and sat in the LORD's presence, "Who am I, LORD God, and what's my family that you've brought me this far? 17It's a small thing for you, but you've talked about my dynasty for a long time to come and regarded me by the standard for men of high degree. 18What more can I say about the honor you've put on me? You know me. 19For my sake and from your own heart, you've done these great things and made them known. 20Nobody's like you; there's no God besides you. From everything we've heard, 21what nation is like Israel? You went to redeem them out of Egypt to make a name for yourself with great and terrifying acts, in driving out nations ahead of your people. 22You made Israel your people permanently and became their God. 23Now make permanent your promise about me and my dynasty. 24Establish your name and make it great forever. 25-26It's a good thing that you've revealed to me that you'll build a dynasty for me. That's encouraged me to pray to you. 27It has pleased you to bless my family so it will continue permanently. You've blessed it forever."</span>
