## 1 Chronicles Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So Israel was enrolled by genealogies. They're recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel. Judah was exiled to Babylon because they were unfaithful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The first to live again in their towns were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Temple servants. 3Some descendants of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem: 4from the descendants of Perez son of Judah was Uthai son of Ammihud son of Omri son of Imri son of Bani; 7from the descendants of Benjamin were Sallu son of Meshullam son of Hodaviah son of Hassenuah, 8and Ibneiah son of Jeroham, Elah son of Uzzi son of Michri, and Meshullam son of Shephatiah son of Reuel son of Ibnijah, 9and their relatives by generations: 956. Those were heads of families.										1 Ch 9:1-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> From the priests were Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, 11Azariah son of Hilkiah son of Meshullam son of Zadok son of Meraioth son of Ahitub, the chief officer of God's Temple; 12Adaiah son of Jeroham son of Pashhur son of Malchijah, Maasai son of Adiel son of Jahzerah son of Meshullam son of Meshillemith son of Immer, 13and their relatives, heads of their families: 1,760 capable men for the service of God's Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> From the Levites were Shemaiah son of Hasshub son of Azrikam son of Hashabiah from the sons of Merari; 15Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, Mattaniah son of Mica son of Zichri son of Asaph, 16Obadiah son of Shemaiah son of Galal son of Jeduthun, Berechiah son of Asa son of Elkanah that lived in the villages of the Netophathites.			1 Ch 9:10-16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their relatives, (Shallum the chief) 18stationed previously at the king's gate to the east. 19Shallum son of Kore son of Ebiasaph son of Korah, and his relatives from his family—the Korahites—were over the work of the service, who kept the thresholds of the tent like their ancestors had done over the entrance to the camp of the LORD. 20Phinehas son of Eleazar ruled them previously; the LORD was with him. 21Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 22There were 212 chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds. They were enrolled by genealogy in their villages, men that David and Samuel the seer appointed in their office of trust. 23They and their descendants guarded the gates of the LORD's house—when it was a tabernacle—24 on all four sides. 25Their relatives in their villages were to come in every seven days to be with them. 26The four chief gatekeepers (Levites) were in an office of trust over the rooms and treasuries in God's Temple. 27They spent the night around God's Temple, because they were responsible for guarding them. They were responsible for opening the gates of the LORD's house each morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Some of them were responsible for the utensils for service. They counted them when they brought them in and took them out. 29Some were appointed to oversee the furniture and utensils for the sanctuary, the fine flour, the wine, oil, frankincense, and spices. 30Some descendants of the priests mixed the spices. 31Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for what was baked in pans. 32Some relatives of the Kohathites prepared the showbread every Sabbath. 								1 Ch 9:17-32</span>
