## Ezra Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, to fulfill his message through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up Cyrus. He sent a written proclamation everywhere in his kingdom: 2"Cyrus, king of Persia, says, 'The LORD God of heaven has given me the kingdoms of the world and appointed me to build him a temple in Jerusalem, in Judah. 3Whoever is from his people, your God be with you! Go up and rebuild the Temple of the LORD God of Israel, the God in Jerusalem. 4Wherever there's a survivor, support him with silver and gold, supplies and livestock, plus freewill offerings.'" 	       Ezra 1:1-4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God stirred up the leaders of the tribes from Judah and Benjamin along with the priests and Levites to go to Jerusalem to rebuild his Temple. 6Their neighbors encouraged them with silver and gold items, with goods, livestock, and valuables, plus freewill offerings. 7Cyrus brought out the items from the LORD's Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had carried to the temple of his gods. 8He had Mithredath the treasurer bring them out and count them out to Sheshbazzar, ruler of Judah: 930 gold basins, 1,000 silver basins, 29 censers, 1030 gold bowls, 410 silver bowls, 1,000 other articles—115,400 gold and silver items in all. Sheshbazzar took them up with the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.        	  Ezra 1:5-11</span>
