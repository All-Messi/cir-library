## Ezra Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo served as prophets to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then Zerubbabel and Jeshua started again to rebuild God’s Temple. His prophets supported them. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>At that time, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues came and asked, <em>“Who issued a decree for you to rebuild this </em><em>Temple</em><em> and </em><em>restore</em><em> this structure?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>We told them the names of the men that were reconstructing it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But God kept an eye on the elders of the Jews. They didn’t stop them till a report could go to Darius and a written reply could come back.     <strong>Ezra 5:1-6</strong> 	              <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Here’s a copy of Tattenai’s letter to King Darius:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>We</em><em> have gone to the province Judah, to the Temple</em><em> of the great God, which is being built with huge stones and </em><em>with </em><em>beams </em><em>that </em><em>are being laid in the walls.</em><em> </em><em>This work is </em><em>progressing</em><em> with great care and is </em><em>getting done</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> asked those elders who issued them</em><em> a dec</em><em>ree to rebuild that Temple. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> </em><em>asked</em><em> </em><em>for </em><em>their names so </em><em>we could write down who was in charge and </em><em>inform you</em><em>. </em></span>
