## Ezra Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Heads of Families and the Genealogies of Men 13from the family of Adonikam (coming later): Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah plus 60 men;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I assembled them at the canal that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. When I looked over the people and the priests, I didn't find any Levites. 16So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam (leaders), and for Joiarib and Elnathan (teachers). 17I sent them to Iddo, leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to tell him and his brothers (the Temple servants at that place) to bring ministers to us for God's Temple. 18By God's good hand on us, they brought Sherebiah (an insightful son of Mahli, descendant of Levi) as well as his sons and brothers, 18 men;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men; 20220 Temple servants that David and the officials had given to assist the Levites—all identified by name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then I declared a fast at the Ahava Canal, to humble ourselves toward God and look to him for a safe journey for us, our little ones, and our possessions. 22I was ashamed to ask the king for troops and cavalry to protect us, because we'd told him, "God favors those who look to him. His power and anger oppose those who leave him." 23We fasted and looked to God on the matter, and he listened to our plea. 		                                                     Ezra 8:15-23</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then I set apart 12 leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 others. 25I weighed out to them the silver and gold, the utensils, and the offering for God's Temple that the king, his advisors, officials, and all Israel present there had offered: 2624½ tons 650 talents of silver, utensils worth 7,550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 7,550 lbs 100 talents of gold, 2720 bowls worth 19 lbs 1,000 darics of gold; and 2 utensils of fine, shiny bronze, precious as gold. 28Then I said, "You're holy to the LORD; the utensils are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your ancestors. 29Keep them till you weigh them in the presence of the leading priests, Levites, and heads of families at Jerusalem, in the rooms in the LORD's Temple."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The priests and Levites received the silver, gold, and utensils, to take to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then we left the Ahava River on the twelfth day, first month to go to Jerusalem. God watched over us and delivered us from enemies and ambushes along the way. 32We arrived at Jerusalem and rested three days. 33On the fourth day, we weighed out in God's Temple the silver, gold, and utensils to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, Eleazar son of Phinehas, and the Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 34We numbered and weighed everything, and recorded the total.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The exiles offered burnt offerings to God: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering. 36Then they delivered the king's edicts to his satraps and governors of Beyond the River [Ever-hannahar, Hebrew], and they supported the people and God's Temple.
