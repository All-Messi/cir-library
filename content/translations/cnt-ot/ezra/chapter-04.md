## Ezra Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were rebuilding a temple to the LORD God of Israel, 2they approached Zerubbabel and the other leaders, "Let us build with you. We worship your God too. We've been sacrificing to him since Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, sent us here." 3But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders said, "You don't have anything in common with us building a temple to our God. We'll build it like King Cyrus decreed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Other residents in the land tried to discourage the people and scare them away from building. 5They bribed advisors to work against them all during Cyrus' reign till the reign of Darius, king of Persia.         	  Ezra 4:1-5</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Years later, at the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus/Xerxes, they lodged a complaint against Judah and Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Still later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote to Artaxerxes. The letter was in Aramaic script and translated into the Aramaic language for the king. 8Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary wrote out the letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes—9they and their associates on behalf of the judges and local leaders, officials, and secretaries over the people of Erech, Babylonia, and Susa (Elam), 10and the rest of the nations that the great and honorable Osnappar/Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River [Avar-naharah, Aramaic]. 11Here's a copy of the letter:      Ezra 4:6-11a</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Jews that came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem. They're rebuilding the rebellious, evil city, finishing its walls and repairing its foundation. 13If it's rebuilt and its walls are finished, they won't pay tribute, custom, or toll, and it'll damage the king's revenue. 14Because we serve the palace, it's not fitting for us to see your dishonor. We've sent to inform you 15so a search can be made in your ancestors' records. You'll discover that the city has been rebellious and damaging to kings and provinces, that they've incited revolt in the past, and that's why it was destroyed. 16If it's rebuilt and its walls finished, you won't have any possession in Beyond the River."   	        Ezra 4:11b-16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The king answered Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates in Samaria and the rest of Beyond the River:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The document you sent us has been translated and read to me. 19I've issued a decree. A search has been made, and it's been discovered that the city has rebelled against kings in the past, that revolution and sedition have occurred in it; 20that strong kings have ruled Jerusalem, governing the whole province Beyond the River; and that they received tribute, custom, and toll. 21So issue a decree to stop those men from rebuilding the city till I issue a decree. 22Take care of this matter promptly. We must not let this situation harm the royal interests</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> As soon as Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates read a copy of King Artaxerxes' letter, they hurried to Jerusalem and stopped the Jews by force. 24The work on the Temple halted till the second year of Darius, king of Persia.	  Ezra 4:17-24</span>
