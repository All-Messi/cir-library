### 6“Now then, Tattenai, governor of Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, officials in the provinces Beyond the River, don’t interfere. 7Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild God’s Temple on its site. 8And, I decree what you’re to do for those elders in rebuilding this Temple: without delay pay them the full cost out of the royal treasury from taxes in the provinces Beyond the River. 9As the priests in Jerusalem request, give daily whatever they need: young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings, wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil. 10Then they can offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 11For anybody who violates this edict, I decree that a timber be pulled out of his house, he be impaled on it, and his house be made a garbage pile. 12May the God that has put his name there overthrow any king or people that tries to violate this decree and destroy that Temple of God. I, Darius, have made this decree. Carry it out diligently.”	  	Ezra 6:6-12 Completion and Dedication of the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Tattenai, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates carried out the decree diligently. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The elders of the Jews succeeded in the construction by the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah.

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The exiles observed Passover on the <strong>fourteenth of the first month</strong>. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The priests and Levites had purified themselves. They killed the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Israelites from the exile and the ones that had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations in the land, joined them in reaching out to the LORD God of Israel by eating <em>the Passover</em>. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>They observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for a week with joy because the LORD had given them reason to celebrate. He had inclined the heart of the Assyrian king to encourage them in the work on his Temple.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	     </strong></span>
