## Ezra Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the seventh month came and the Israelites were in the towns, they came together in Jerusalem. 2Jeshua son of Jozadak, his brothers the priests, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and his brothers built God's altar for offering burnt offerings as written in the Law of Moses, the man of God. 3They set up the altar on its original site despite their fear of the people around them. They offered burnt offerings to the LORD morning and evening. 4They celebrated the Festival of Booths as written and offered the set number of burnt offerings daily as required by the Law. 5From then on, there was continual burnt offering for new moons and the annual festivals the LORD had consecrated. Everyone offered a freewill offering to the LORD. 6From the first day, seventh month, they offered burnt offerings, but the foundation of the Temple hadn't been laid. 7Then they donated money to the masons and carpenters as well as food, drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians to bring cedar from Lebanon by sea to Joppa with permission from Cyrus.	  Ezra 3:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The second month, second year after arriving at God's Temple, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, the rest of the priests and Levites, and everybody from the captivity began the work. They appointed the Levites 20 years and older as supervisors. 9To oversee the workmen, Jeshua with his sons and relatives stood united with Kadmiel and his sons (all descendants of Judah/Hodaviah) and with the Levites from the family of Henadad. 10When the builders had laid the foundation, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets. The Levites, descendants of Asaph, stood with cymbals to praise the LORD according to King David's directions. 11They sang, praising and thanking the LORD, "He's good; his love for Israel endures forever." The people shouted when they praised him because the foundation had been laid. 12Yet many priests, Levites, and heads of families—old men who'd seen the first Temple—cried out loud. Many others shouted out loud with so much joy 13that people couldn't tell the shout of joy from the outcry of weeping. They could be heard for a long way.	  Ezra 3:8-13</span>
