## Ezra Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the <strong>seventh month</strong> came and the Israelites were in the towns, they came together in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jeshua son of Jozadak, his brothers the priests, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and his brothers built God’s altar for offering burnt offerings as written in the Law of Moses, the man of God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They set up the altar on its original site despite their fear of the people around them. They offered burnt offerings to the LORD morning and evening. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They celebrated the Festival of Booths as written and offered the set number of burnt offerings daily as required by the Law. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>From then on, there was continual burnt offering for new moons and the annual festivals the LORD had consecrated. Everyone offered a freewill offering to the LORD. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>From the <strong>first day, seventh month</strong>, they offered burnt offerings, but the foundation of the Temple hadn’t been laid. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then they donated money to the masons and carpenters as well as food, drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians to bring cedar from Lebanon by sea to Joppa with permission from Cyrus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The <strong>second month, second year</strong> after arriving at God’s Temple, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, the rest of the priests and Levites, and everybody from the captivity began the work. They appointed the Levites 20 years and older as supervisors. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>To oversee the workmen, Jeshua with his sons and relatives stood united with Kadmiel and his sons (all descendants of Judah/<em>Hodaviah</em>) and with the Levites from the family of Henadad. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When the builders had laid the foundation, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets. The Levites, descendants of Asaph, <em>stood </em>with cymbals to praise the LORD according to King David’s directions. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They sang, praising and thanking the LORD, <em>“</em><em>He’</em><em>s good</em><em>;</em><em> his </em><em>love</em><em> </em><em>for</em><em> Israel </em><em>endures </em><em>forever.” </em>The people shouted when they praised him because the foundation had been laid. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Yet many priests, Levites, and heads of families—old men who’d seen the first Temple—cried out loud. Many others shouted out loud with so much joy <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>that people couldn’t tell the shout of joy from the outcry of weeping. They could be heard for a long way.</span>
