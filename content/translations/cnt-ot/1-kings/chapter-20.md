## 1 Kings Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Benhadad, king of Aram, gathered his army, 32 kings with horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege to Samaria and attacked it. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He sent ambassadors to Ahab in the city, <em>“Benh</em><em>adad says, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>‘<em>Y</em><em>our silver and gold are mine. Y</em><em>our most beautiful wives and children are mine too.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The king of Israel said, <em>“It’s according</em><em> to your message, my lord king. I</em><em> and </em><em>everything</em><em> I have</em><em> are yours</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>The ambassadors came back, <em>“This is what Benh</em><em>adad said, ‘I sent to you saying, “You’ll give me your silver and gold, your wives and your children</em><em>,”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>but about this time tomorrow I’ll send my </em><em>official</em><em>s to search your </em><em>palac</em><em>e and your </em><em>official</em><em>s</em><em>’ houses</em><em>.</em><em> T</em><em>hey’ll carry </em><em>off whatever you consider valuable</em><em>.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The king of Israel called the elders of the land, <em>“S</em><em>ee how this man is looking </em><em>to make</em><em> trouble</em><em>;</em><em> he sent for my wives</em><em>,</em><em> my children</em><em>, my silver and gold. </em><em>I didn’t </em><em>tell him no</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The elders and the people advised, <em>“Don’t agree</em><em> </em>to anything<em>.”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He said to Benhadad’s ambassadors, <em>“Tell my lord the king, ‘</em><em>Everything you sent for </em><em>the first </em><em>time </em><em>I’ll do, but I can’t do this.”</em> The ambassadors took him that message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Benhadad sent to him, <em>“May the gods do so to me and more also, if the</em><em>re’s enough</em><em> dust </em><em>left in</em><em> Samar</em><em>ia for each of my soldiers to have a handful</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The king of Israel answered, <em>“The one</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> </em><em>puts</em><em> on his armor </em><em>shouldn’t brag</em><em> like </em><em>the one</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> takes it off.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>When Benhadad heard it, he was drinking with the kings in temporary shelters and told his officers, <em>“</em><em>Take</em> <em>your</em><em> positions</em><em>.”</em> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong> They took their positions against the city.</span>

### Ahab’s Victory over Ben-Hadad


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>A prophet approached Ahab, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says, ‘</em><em>I’ll delive</em><em>r this big army to you today, and </em><em><u>you’ll know I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em>.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Ahab said, <em>“Who’ll do it</em><em>?”</em> <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says the young men of the rulers in</em><em> the province.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Who’</em><em>ll begin the battle?”</em> <em>“You.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The troops came out of the city along with the entire army. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>They each killed their man, the Arameans fled, and Israel chased them. Benhadad escaped on a horse with the cavalry. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The king of Israel struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans with a great slaughter.<strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 20:13-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The prophet came to the king, <em>“Make plans for another attack. A</em><em>t the </em><em>first</em><em> of the year</em><em>, the king of Aram will come back</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Now the officers of Aram’s king told him, <em>“Their gods are </em><em>mountain </em><em>gods; so </em><em>they were stronger than we were. Let’s fight them o</em><em>n the plain</em><em>s.</em><em> </em><em>We’ll </em><em>surely be stronger than they are.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Put a commander in place of each king. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Muster an army like the one you’ve lost, horse for horse,</em><em> chariot for chariot.</em><em> </em><em>Then fight them in the plain</em><em>;</em><em> we’ll surely be stronger than they are.”</em><em>	 </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 20:22-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>At the first of the year, Benhadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight Israel. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The Israelites mustered, gathered provisions, and went to meet them. They camped there like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the countryside. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Then a man of God came up and told the king of Israel<em>, </em><em>  </em> <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says, </em><em>‘Because the </em><em>Aramea</em><em>ns have said</em><em> I’m </em><em>a</em><em> mountain</em><em> god</em><em>,</em><em> not a god of the valleys</em><em>,</em><em> I’ll give this great </em><em>army</em><em> to you</em><em>;</em><em> </em><em><u>you’ll</u></em><em> </em><em><u>know I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em>.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>They camped against one another for a week. The seventh day, the battle began, and the Israelites k</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>His officers told him, <em>“We’ve heard that the kings of Israel are merciful.</em><em> L</em><em>et</em><em>’s</em><em> put </em><em>burlap</em><em> </em><em>around our waists</em><em> and ropes on our heads, a</em><em>nd go out to the king of Israel. M</em><em>aybe he’ll </em><em>let you live</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong>So they put burlap around their waists and ropes on their heads, and went to the king of Israel, <em>“</em><em>Benhadad says, ‘</em><em>Please </em><em>don’t kill me</em><em>.’”</em><em> </em> He said, <em>“Is </em><em>my brother</em><em> still alive?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>The officers quickly picked up on his word and said, <em>“Your brother Benh</em><em>adad</em>.<em>”</em> He said, <em>“Go</em><em> bring him</em><em> here</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>Benhadad came out, and he took him up into the chariot.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup><em>Benh</em><em>adad</em> told him, <em>“I’ll restore the </em><em>towns</em><em> my father took from your father, and you’ll </em><em>make </em><em>stree</em><em>ts in Damascus like my father di</em><em>d in Samaria.”</em><em> Ahab</em> said, <em>“And I’ll let you go with this </em><em>treaty</em><em>.”</em> He made a treaty with him and let him go.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### A Prophet Condemns Ahab’s Release


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>One man from the company of prophets said to another by a message from the LORD, <em>“</em><em>Strike</em><em> me</em><em>,</em><em>”</em> but he wouldn’t do it. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>“Because you’ve ignored </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, as soon as you</em><em> leave </em><em>me, a lion will kill you.”</em><em> </em>That’s what happened.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>He found another man, <em>“</em><em>Strike</em><em> me.”</em> He struck him and wounded him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>The prophet left and waited for the king by the road. He disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>As the king went by, he shouted, <em>“</em><em>I </em><em>went into the battle, and a man brought a </em><em>fellow</em><em> </em><em>over and said, ‘Guard this man. I</em><em>f he’s missing</em><em> </em><em>for any reason, </em><em>it’s your life for his</em><em>, or you’ll pay </em><em>75½ lbs </em><em><sup>a talent</sup></em><em> of silver.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>While </em><em>I </em><em>was busy here and there, he got away.”</em><em>  </em> The king told him, <em>“That’s </em><em>what </em><em>your</em><em> judgment</em><em> </em><em>will be. Y</em><em>ou’ve decided it yourself.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Right away he took the bandage off his eyes, and the king recognized he was one of the prophets. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>He told him, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says, since you</em><em> let the man go that </em><em>he’d devoted to destruction, it’s </em><em>your life for his and your people for his.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>The king of Israel went home to Samaria sullen and resentful.<strong>	</strong></span>
