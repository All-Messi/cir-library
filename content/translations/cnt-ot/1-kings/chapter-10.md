<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Kg 10:26-29</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> She gave him 4½ tons 120 talents of gold and large amounts of spices and precious stones. Never again did such an abundance of spices come in as she brought him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Hiram's ships that brought gold from Ophir also brought large quantities of almug wood and precious stones. 12From the almug wood, the king made railings for the LORD's Temple and his own palace, as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Such almug wood hasn't come in again or been seen since.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for besides what he gave her on his own. Then she and her attendants went back to her country.	1 Kg 10:1-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Each year, 25¼ tons 666 talents of gold came in to Solomon 15besides what came in from traders, merchants' wares, the kings of Arabia, and governors of the country. 16He made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 15 lbs 600 shekels of gold on each one. 17He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using 3¾ lbs 3 minas of gold on each one. He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 18In addition, he made a large throne out of ivory, overlaid with refined gold. 19There were 6 steps up to it, a round top on the back of it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside them. 2012 lions stood on the 2 sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 21His drinking cups were made out of gold; the items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There weren't any silver ones; it wasn't considered valuable in his time. 22At sea he had the ships of Tarshish with Hiram's ships. Every three years ships came from Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> King Solomon became wealthier and wiser than all the other kings in the world. 24The whole world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God had put in him. 25Everybody brought a gift, silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much each year. 	1 Kg 10:14-25</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Solomon gathered 1,400 chariots and 12,000 calvary and stationed them in chariot cities and in Jerusalem. 27He made silver as common as stone in Jerusalem, and cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lower western hills. 28His merchants obtained horses from Egypt and Kue for a price. 29He imported Egyptian chariots for 15 lbs 600 shekels of silver each and horses for 3¾ lbs 150 shekels of silver apiece. Then he exported them to the kings of the Hittites and of Aram.</span>
