## 1 Kings Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon’s fame that honored the LORD, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She came with a large retinue, and with camels carrying spices, lots of gold, and precious stones. She talked to him about everything that was on her mind. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He answered all her questions and explained everything. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>She saw his wisdom, the palace he’d built, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway up to the LORD’s Temple. It took her breath away. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“W</em><em>hat I heard in my country about your words and wisdom</em><em> </em><em>was true</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>But I didn’t believe </em><em>it</em><em> till I saw it.</em><em> I hadn’t heard </em><em>ha</em><em>lf of it. You exceed </em><em>the report I heard</em><em> about your prosperity. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>How fortunate </em><em>your </em><em>officials</em><em> </em><em>are, being</em><em> </em><em>around you continually and listening to your wisdom! </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Bless the</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God who delighted </em><em>to set you on </em><em>Israel’s</em><em> throne.</em><em> </em><em>Because he loved Israel forever, he made you king to do justice and </em><em>good</em><em>ness.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Hiram’s ships that brought gold from Ophir also brought large quantities of almug wood and precious stones. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>From the almug wood, the king made railings for the LORD’s Temple and his own palace, as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Such almug wood hasn’t come in again or been seen since.</span>

### Solomon’s Wealth and Splendor


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Each year, 25¼ tons <sup>666 talents</sup> of gold came in to Solomon <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>besides what came in from traders, merchants’ wares, the kings of Arabia, and governors of the country. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He</span>

### large shields of beaten gold, using 15 lbs 600 shekels of gold on each one. 17He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using 3¾ lbs 3 minas of gold on each one. He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 18In addition, he made a large throne out of ivory, overlaid with refined gold. 19There were 6 steps up to it, a round top on the back of it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside them. 2012 lions stood on the 2 sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 21His drinking cups were made out of gold; the items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There weren’t any silver ones; it wasn’t considered valuable in his time. 22At sea he had the ships of Tarshish with Hiram’s ships. Every three years ships came from Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.


<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>King Solomon became wealthier and wiser than all the <em>other</em> kings in the world. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The whole world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God had put in him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Everybody brought a gift, silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much each year. <strong>	</strong></span>
