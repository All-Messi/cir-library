## 1 Kings Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When Solomon had finished building the LORD’s Temple, the king’s palace, and everything he wanted to do, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>the LORD appeared to him a second time like he did at Gibeon. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“I’ve heard your </em><em>prayer and consecrated this Temple</em><em> you’ve built by putting my name there </em><em>permanently</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>My eyes and heart will </em><em>always </em><em>be there. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If you’ll </em><em>follow</em><em> me like you</em><em>r</em><em> father did in the integrity of heart and </em><em>godliness, do everything I tell </em><em>you</em><em>,</em><em> keep my statutes and ordinance</em><em>s</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>the</em><em>n</em><em> I’ll </em><em>make</em><em> your throne </em><em>secure </em><em>over </em><em>Israel permanently</em><em> like I promised David, ‘</em><em>You’ll always</em><em> </em><em>have a descendant</em><em> on </em><em>Israel’s throne</em><em>.’</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“B</em><em>ut if you or</em><em> your sons turn away from me to</em><em> serve and worship other gods, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I’ll </em><em>remove</em><em> Israe</em><em>l from the land I’ve given them, and</em><em> </em><em>throw</em><em> </em><em>away the Temple</em><em> </em><em>I’ve consecrated. </em><em>Israel</em><em> will become a proverb, a byword among the</em><em> </em><em>nations</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>This Temple</em><em> will become a </em><em>pile of ruins. E</em><em>verybody that goes by will be </em><em>amazed</em><em> and </em><em>gasp</em><em>, ‘Why has the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> done</em><em> this to this land and this Temple</em><em>?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>People will</em><em> say, ‘Because they forsook the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt</em><em>. They</em><em> adopted other gods and worshiped and served them.’”</em><strong>      </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### years it took him to build the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace, King Solomon gave Hiram 20 towns in Galilee. (11Hiram, king of Tyre, had supplied him with all the cedar, cypress, and gold he wanted.) 12Hiram came out from Tyre to see them, but he didn’t like them. 13“What are these towns you’ve given me, brother?” They’re still called The Land of Cabul [A Land as Good as Nothing]. 14Nevertheless, Hiram sent Solomon 4½ tons 120 talents of gold. Solomon’s Other Achievements


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>This is the conscripted labor King Solomon levied to build the LORD’s Temple, his own palace, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer, burned it, killed the Canaanites in it, and gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the Lower Beth-horon, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Baalath, Tamar in the Wilderness of Judah, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>his storage cities, cities for his chariots and cavalry, and everything he wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and the land he ruled. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>To this day Solomon has conscripted laborers from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>that Israel couldn’t destroy. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But he didn’t conscript Israelites for forced labor. They were soldiers, officials, officers, captains, chariot commanders, and cavalry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from The City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he built the Millo.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he built to the LORD, burning incense with them. And so he finished the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>He also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in Edom. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Hiram sent experienced seamen with the fleet along with Solomon’s men. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>They went to Ophir and brought</span>
