## 1 Kings Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A message from the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Since I lifted you up from the dust </em><em>to lead</em><em> </em><em>Israel, </em><em>you’ve done what Jeroboam did and </em><em>got</em><em> Israel </em><em>to </em><em>do and </em><em>made me angry by their sins. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I’ll consume </em><em>you</em><em> and </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em>family</em><em> and make </em><em>it</em><em> like </em><em>Jeroboam’s</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><em>Dogs will eat any relat</em></strong><strong><em>ive</em></strong><strong><em> that dies in the city</em></strong><strong><em>; b</em></strong><strong><em>irds will eat any that die in the field.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>The rest of the acts of Baasha and the strength of his rule are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He died and they buried him in Tirzah. His son <u>Elah</u> became king. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>In addition, a message from the LORD through the prophet Jehu came against Baasha and his dynasty. <em>It came against him</em> because of his sin that made the LORD angry like Jeroboam’s dynasty did, and because he destroyed Jeroboam’s family.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### Elah Rules in Israel


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>In the <strong>twenty-sixth year of Asa</strong>, king of Judah, <u>Elah</u> became king of Israel at Tirzah <em>and ruled </em>for <strong>2 years</strong>. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Zimri, commander of half his chariots, led a plot against him. Elah was at Tirzah getting drunk in the house of Arza, who managed the palace at Tirzah. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death in the <strong>twenty-seventh year of Asa</strong> and became king. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>As soon as he became king, he killed Baasha’s family. He didn’t leave a single male among his relatives and friends. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So Zimri destroyed Baasha’s family like the LORD had said through the prophet Jehu.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>He delivered that message</em> because of the sins Baasha and Elah did and got Israel to do with their idols and made the LORD angry. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The rest of the acts of Elah are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

### Zimri Rules in Israel


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>In the <strong>twenty-seventh year of Asa</strong>, <u>Zimri</u> ruled for <strong>7 days</strong> at Tirzah. The people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The people camped there heard that Zimri had struck down the king; so Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king of Israel that day in the camp. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Then Omri and Israel went up from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortress of the king’s palace and burned it down over himself and died. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>He did it </em>because of his sins, following the way of Jeroboam and getting Israel to sin. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</em>. <strong>Omri Rules in Israel</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>The people of Israel were divided: half followed Tibni son of Ginath and half followed Omri. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But the ones that followed Omri prevailed. Tibni died and <u>Omri</u> became king. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>In the <strong>thirty-first year of Asa</strong>, king of Judah, Omri became king in Israel and ruled for <strong>12 years, 6 in Tirzah</strong>. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He bought the hill of Samaria from “Shemer”</span>
<p class="section-ref">for 151</p>

### lbs two talents of silver, and built a city on it that he named Samaria after its owner. 25Omri did evil worse than anybody before him. 26He did everything Jeroboam did and got Israel to do. 27The rest of the acts of Omri and the strength he showed are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 28He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son Ahab became king.	 1 Kg 16:15-28 Ahab Rules in Israel


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup><u>Ahab</u> became king of Israel in the <strong>thirty-eighth year of Asa</strong>, king of Judah, and ruled Israel in Samaria for <strong>22 years</strong>. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He did evil worse than anybody before him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>As though it had been a trivial thing for him to follow in the sins of Jeroboam, he married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, and went to serve and worship Baal. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>He erected an altar for Baal in a temple he built for Baal in Samaria <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>and set up an Asherah pole. He did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel than any king of Israel before him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>During his reign, Hiel from Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, in fulfillment of the LORD’s message through Joshua son of Nun.<strong>	 </strong></span>
