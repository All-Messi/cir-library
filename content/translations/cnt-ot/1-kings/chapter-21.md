## 1 Kings Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After this, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel beside King Ahab's palace. 2Ahab spoke to him about it, "Give me your vineyard so I can use it for a vegetable garden; it's close to my palace. I'll trade you a better vineyard for it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But Naboth said, "The LORD forbid me from giving you my ancestors' inheritance."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Ahab went home sullen and resentful. He lay down on his bed and turned away and wouldn't eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> His wife Jezebel came in, "Why are you so sullen you won't eat?" 6"I asked Naboth to let me buy his vineyard or trade him for another one, but he wouldn't do it.'" 	1 Kg 21:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jezebel said, "Do you rule Israel? Get up, eat something, and be happy. I'll get you his vineyard." 8She wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles in Naboth's town, 9"Declare a fast and seat Naboth in a prominent place. 10Put two worthless fellows with him and have them accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then take him out and stone him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The elders and nobles 12declared a fast and put Naboth in a prominent place. 13The two worthless fellows came in and sat down with him, and started accusing him of cursing God and the king. They took him outside the city and stoned him, 14and sent word to Jezebel. 15She told Ahab, "Go take Naboth's vineyard; he's dead." 16He got up to go down and take it. 	1 Kg 21:7-16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then a message from the LORD came to Elijah, 18"Meet Ahab in Naboth's vineyard. He's gone down to confiscate it. 19Tell him I've said, 'Have you murdered and confiscated? Where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, they'll lick up yours.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Ahab said, "Have you found me, my enemy?" "I've found you because you've sold yourself to doing evil in the LORD's presence. 21'I'll bring evil on you and completely sweep you away. I'll remove from you every male in Israel, bond or free, 22and make your dynasty like Jeroboam's and Baasha's; you've made me angry and got Israel to sin.' 23The LORD has also said dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel. 24Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Nobody had sold himself to doing evil like Ahab did, influenced by his wife. 26He acted horribly in following idols like the Amorites had done that the LORD originally drove out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When Ahab heard that, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and fasted. He lay down in burlap and walked around in mourning. 28Then a message came to Elijah, 29"See how Ahab has humbled himself? Since he's done that, I won't do what I'd promised during his lifetime. I'll bring it on his family during his son's life."	 1 Kg 21:17-29</span>
