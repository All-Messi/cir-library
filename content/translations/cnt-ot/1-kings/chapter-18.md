<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In <strong>the third year</strong>, a message from the LORD came to Elijah, <em>“Present</em><em> yourself to Ahab</em><em>,</em><em> and I’ll send rain.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So he went to Ahab.

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>They divided up the land to survey it. Ahab went one way and Obadiah went another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Elijah met Obadiah on the road. He recognized him and fell on his face, <em>“Is t</em><em>hat</em><em> you, Elijah?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“It’s me.</em><em> Go</em><em> tell you</em><em>r</em><em> master</em><em> I’m</em><em> here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Obadiah went and told Ahab, and he came to meet Elijah. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When Ahab saw him, he said, <em>“Is that you, you troubler of Israel?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He said, <em>“I</em><em> haven’t brought trouble on</em><em> Israel</em><em>.

### Asherah prophets that eat at Jezebel’s table.” The Contest on Mount Carmel


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Ahab sent a message among the Israelites and brought the prophets to Mount Carmel. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Elijah faced the people and said, <em>“How long will you waver between two </em><em>sides</em><em>?</em><em> If the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is God, follow him. I</em><em>f Baal</em><em> is god</em><em>, follow him.”</em> The people didn’t say anything. <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 18:16-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Then Elijah told them, <em>“</em><em>I’m the only </em><em>prophet the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has left;</em><em> Baal</span>

### of them. 23Let us have two oxen. They can choose one, cut it up, lay it on the wood, but not put any fire under it. I’ll prepare the other, lay it on the wood, and not put fire under it. 24Then you call on your god, and I’ll call on the LORD. The one that answers by fire, is God.” The people answered, “That’s good.”


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Elijah told the Baal prophets, <em>“Choose </em><em>an</em><em> o</em><em>x and prepare it first; there are</em><em> </em><em>lots of you. C</em><em>all on your go</em><em>d, but don’t pu</em><em>t fire under it.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They prepared their ox and called on Baal from morning till noon, <em>“Baal, answer us.”</em> There was no answer. They leaped around the altar they’d made. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>At about noon Elijah mocked them, <em>“Shout,</em><em> because he’s a god. Either he’</em><em>s occu</em><em>pied or has wandered off. Maybe he’</em><em>s </em><em>traveling</em><em> or asleep and needs to be woke up.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>As was their custom, they shouted and cut themselves with swords and lances till blood gushed out on them. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>When noon had passed, they raved till the time for evening sacrifice. But there wasn’t any voice, nobody answered, nobody paid attention. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Then Elijah told the crowd to come closer. He repaired the LORD’s altar that had been torn down. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He</span>
<p class="section-ref">took 12</p>

### stones corresponding to the 12 tribes of Jacob, whose name the LORD had changed to ‘Israel.’ 32With the stones, he rebuilt the altar in the LORD’s name and dug a trench around it big enough to hold more than .73 of a bushel 2 seahs of seed. 33Then he arranged the wood, cut the ox in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He told them to fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood. 34“Do it again.” “Do it a third time.” 35The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench. 36Then at the time of evening sacrifice, he went up to the altar and said, “LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, show today that you’re God in Israel, that I’m your servant, that you’ve told me to do this. 37Answer me so the people can know you’re God and that you’ve brought them back to you.” 	     	1 Kg 18:30-37


<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>Fire came down from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, the dust, and the water in the trench. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>The people fell on their faces, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is God! The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is God!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Elijah told them, <em>“Seize the </em><em>Baal prophets. D</em><em>on’t let a one of them </em><em>get away</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>They seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon River and killed them. <strong>The L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> Sends Rain</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Elijah told Ahab,<em> “Go </em><em>get something to</em><em> eat</em><em>;</em><em> there’s the sound of heavy rain.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong>Ahab went to eat. Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel and crouched down with his head between his knees. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>He told his servant to<em> </em>go look toward the sea<em>.</em> He went and looked, <em>“There’s nothing.”</em> He said, <em>“Go back</em><em>,</em><em>”</em> seven times. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>The seventh time, the servant said, <em>“A cloud </em><em>the size of</em><em> a man’s hand is coming up from the </em><em>horizon</em><em>.”</em> He said, <em>“Go </em><em>tell </em><em>Ahab</em><em> to g</em><em>et </em><em>his</em><em> chariot ready and go down </em><em>so the rain doesn’t stop </em><em>him</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a downpour came. Ahab rode to Jezreel. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>The LORD was with Elijah, and he girded up and outran Ahab to Jezreel.<strong>	</strong></span>
