## 1 Kings Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elijah the Tishbite, a settler in Gilead, told Ahab, "As the LORD God of Israel lives that I serve, there won't be dew or rain the next several years except when I say so."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> A message from the LORD came to him, 3"Get away from here to the east and hide by Brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. 4You'll drink from the stream, and I've commanded the ravens to provide for you there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He went to live by Brook Cherith. 6Ravens brought him bread and meat morning and evening, and he drank from the stream. 7After a while it dried up because it hadn't rained.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then a message from the LORD came to him, 9"Go to Zarephath, near Sidon, and stay. I've commanded a widow there to provide for you." 10He went to Zarephath. When he came to the city gate, a widow was gathering sticks. He called to her, "Please get me a little water in a jug to drink." 	1 Kg 17:1-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As she was going to get it, he called to her to bring him a piece of bread too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> She said, "As the LORD your God lives, I don't have any, just a handful of flour in a bowl and a little oil in a jug. I'm gathering a few sticks so I can fix it for us to eat and die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Elijah told her, "Don't worry. Do what you've said but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out. Then you can make one for you and your boy. 14The LORD God of Israel says the bowl of flour won't get empty, and the jug of oil won't go dry before it rains."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> She did what he said; and she, her son, and household ate for many days. 16The bowl didn't get empty, and the jug didn't go dry.	 1 Kg 17:11-16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> After that, her little boy got sick, so sick he quit breathing. 18She said to Elijah, "What do I have to do with you, man of God? You've come to remind me of my sin and put my son to death!" 19"Give him to me." He took him from her arms to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his own bed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He called out, "LORD my God, have you brought misfortune on the widow I've been staying with by causing her son to die?" 21He stretched out on the child three times and called out again, "Please bring him back."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The LORD listened, and the child revived.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Elijah brought him down to his mother. "See, he's alive."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> She told him, "Now I know for sure you're a man of God and what you say from the LORD is true."	    1 Kg 17:17-24</span>
