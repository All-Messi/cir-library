## 1 Kings Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ahab told Jezebel what Elijah had done, and how he'd killed the prophets with the sword. 2She sent a messenger to Elijah, "The gods do so to me and more, if I don't make your life like theirs by tomorrow at this time." 3He fled for his life to Beersheba in Judah and left his attendant there. 4He went on a day's journey into the open country and sat down under a juniper tree, "That's enough, LORD. Take my life. I'm no better than my ancestors." 5He lay down and slept under the tree, and an angel touched him, "Get up and eat." 6He looked and at his head was a loaf of bread baked on hot stones and a jug of water. He ate and lay back down. 7An angel of the LORD came a second time and touched him, "Get up and eat some more, or the trip will be too much for you." 8He ate and on the strength of that food went for 40 days to Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God.	       1 Kg 19:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He came upon a cave and stayed there, and a message from the LORD came to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He said, "I've been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in my presence." The LORD was passing by! A gale was tearing the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces in the LORD's presence, but the LORD wasn't in the wind. After the wind an earthquake came, but the LORD wasn't in the earthquake. 12After the earthquake, fire came, but the LORD wasn't in the fire. After the fire the sound of a gentle whisper came. 13When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. A voice came to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"	     1 Kg 19:9-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He said, "I've been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD told him, "Go back on the road to the Wilderness of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram, 16anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king of Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. 17The one that escapes from Hazael's sword, Jehu will kill, and the one that escapes from Jehu's sword, Elisha will kill. 18I'll preserve 7,000 in Israel, whose knees haven't bowed to Baal, whose lips haven't kissed him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He left and found Elisha plowing with 12 yokes of oxen; he was with the twelfth. Elijah went over and threw his mantle on him. 20He left the oxen and ran after Elijah, "Let me kiss my parents. Then I'll go with you." He told him, "Go on back, but consider what I've done for you." 21He went back, took a yoke of oxen, sacrificed them, and boiled their meat with the yokes. He gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up and followed Elijah as his assistant. 	           1 Kg 19:14-21</span>
