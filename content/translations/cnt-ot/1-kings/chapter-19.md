<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He came upon a cave and stayed there, and a message from the LORD came to him, <em>“What are you doing here, Elijah?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>He said, <strong><em>“I’ve been zealous for </em></strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong><em> because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I’m the only one left, and they’re trying to kill me.” </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Go out and stand on the mountain in </em><em>my presence</em><em>.”</em> The LORD was passing by!

After the wind an earthquake came, but the LORD wasn’t in the earthquake. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>After the earthquake, fire <em>came</em>, but the LORD wasn’t in the fire. After the fire<em> </em>the sound of a gentle whisper came. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. A voice came to him, <em>“What are you doing here, Elijah?”</em><strong>	     </strong></span>

Then I’ll go with you.” He told him, “Go on back, but consider what I’ve done for you.” 21He went back, took a yoke of oxen, sacrificed them, and boiled their meat with the yokes. He gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up and followed Elijah as his assistant. 	           1 Kg 19:14-21 Ahab’s War with Syria
