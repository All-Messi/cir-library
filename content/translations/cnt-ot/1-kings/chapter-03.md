<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh and brought his daughter to The City of David till he’d finished building his own palace, the LORD’s Temple, and the wall around Jerusalem. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>People were still sacrificing on the high places; the LORD didn’t have a temple yet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Solomon loved the LORD and followed his father’s statutes except he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He’d go to Gibeon to sacrifice, the great high place. He of</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>He said, <em>“You’</em><em>ve shown great </em><em>enduring love to David</em><em> as he </em><em>followed after truth,</em><em> </em><em>good</em><em>ness</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em>an upright heart toward you. You’</em><em>ve given him a son to sit on his throne.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Now, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> my God,</em><em> you’</em><em>ve made </em><em>me </em><em>king</em><em>,</em><em> but I’m </em><em>just </em><em>a child.</em><em> </em><em>I don’t know how to </em><em>manage affairs</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I’m among the people you’ve chosen, </em><em>people too </em><em>numerous</em><em> to count.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>G</em><em>ive </em><em>me</em><em> an </em><em>intelligent</em><em> </em><em>mind</em><em> to judge </em><em>them</em><em>, to distinguish good </em><em>from</em><em> bad.</em><em> </em><em>Who </em><em>can</em><em> judge this </em><em>large</em><em> </em><em>nation</em><em>?”</em></span>

### 10 What he asked for pleased the LORD. 11He told him, “Because you’ve asked for that instead of a long life, wealth, or the death of your enemies, 12I’ll give you what you asked for: a wise, discerning mind; there has never been anybody like you before or will be afterwards. 13I’ll also give you what you didn’t ask for: wealth and honor like no other king as long as you live. 14If you follow my ways and keep my statutes and commandments like your father did, I’ll lengthen your life.”


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Solomon woke up; it was a dream. He came to Jerusalem and stood in front of the Ark, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and held a banquet for his officials.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Solomon’s Wise Ruling


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Two prostitutes came and stood in his presence. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>One woman said, <em>“</em><em>My lord, this woman and I live in the same house</em><em>.</em><em> I had a </em><em>baby</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>and t</em><em>h</em><em>ree days later she had one</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>We were the only </em><em>ones there</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Her son died during</em><em> the night because she lay on him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>hile </em><em>I</em><em> was sleeping, </em><em>s</em><em>he got up and took my son and laid him in her arms and laid her dead son by me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>When I got up in the morning to nurse </em><em>him</em><em>, he</em><em> was dead. B</em><em>ut when I looked</em><em> </em><em>c</em><em>losely</em><em>, </em><em>it</em><em> wasn’t my son.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The other woman said, <em>“No! the living one is </em><em>mine.</em><em> </em><em>T</em><em>he dead on</em><em>e’</em><em>s yours.”</em><em> </em> The first woman said, <em>“No! the dead one’</em><em>s your</em><em>s. T</em><em>he living one’s mine.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>The king said, <em>“One says, ‘This is my son that’s alive</em><em>.</em><em>’</em><em> The other says, ‘</em><em>No</em><em>! your son’</em><em>s the dead one.’</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Get me a sword.”</em> They brought him one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>He said, <em>“</em><em>Cut</em><em> the living chi</em><em>ld in two, and give half to </em><em>one and half to the other.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>The real mother spoke out because she was deeply moved over her son, <em>“My </em><em>lord, give her the living child! D</em><em>on’t kil</em><em>l him!</em><em>”</em> The other said, <em>“He w</em><em>on’t be mine or yours. Cut</em><em> him</em><em> in two</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>The king answered, <em>“Give the first woman the living child.</em><em> </em><em>She’s his mother.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>When Israel heard about the judgment he’d handed down, they respected him for the wisdom God had given him for administering justice.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
