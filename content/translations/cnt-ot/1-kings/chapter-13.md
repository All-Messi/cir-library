## 1 Kings Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A man of God went from Judah to Bethel at the LORD’s command while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He cried out against the altar by a message from the LORD, <em>“Altar, a</em><em>ltar, the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says, ‘</em><em>A son named </em><em>Josiah</em><em> </em><em>will be born among</em><em> </em><em>David’s descendants</em><em>.</em><em> H</em><em>e’ll sacrifice </em><em>on you </em><em>the priests of the high </em><em>places who burn incense on you.</em><em> </em><em>He’ll burn </em><em>human bones on you.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>He gave a sign the same day, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>“T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has </em><em>giv</em><em>en</em><em> this sign:</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>he altar will </em><em>open up</em><em> and </em><em>ashes pour</em><em> out.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>When the king heard what the man of God said, he reached out from the altar and said, <em>“</em><em>Arrest him!</em><em>”</em> But his hand froze, and he couldn’t draw it back. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The altar split apart and ashes poured out like the sign had said. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The king answered the man of God, <em>“</em><em>Ask</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God t</em><em>o restore </em><em>my hand.”</em> He asked the LORD, and the king’s hand became like before. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The king said, <em>“Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I’ll give you a reward.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The man of God told him, <em>“If you gave me half </em><em>of what you own</em><em>, I wouldn’t go with you</em><em>,</em><em> eat bread</em><em>,</em><em> or drink water </em><em>here</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>told</em><em> me</em><em> not to</em><em> eat bread</em><em>,</em><em> drink water</em><em>,</em><em> or </em><em>come back</em><em> the way </em><em>I</em><em> </em><em>came</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>So he went back a different way.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 13:7-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>An old prophet was living in Bethel. His sons came and told him what the man of God had done that day in Bethel and what he’d told the king. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Their father asked them which way he went<em>.</em> They’d seen which way he’d gone. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“Saddle the donkey for me.”</em> They saddled it, and he rode <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>after the man of God and found him sitting under a terebinth tree. <em>“Are you the man of God from Judah?”</em> <em>“Yes</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“Come home with me and eat bread.”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em><sup>“</sup></em><em>I can’t </em><em>return</em><em> with you</em><em>,</em><em> eat bread</em><em>, </em><em>or drink water with you </em><em>here.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> told me not to</em><em> eat</em><em> bread, drink water, or go back</em><em> the way </em><em>I</em><em> </em><em>came</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>He told him, <em>“I’m a prophet li</em><em>ke you. A</em><em>n angel </em><em>from</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> told me to b</em><em>ring </em><em>you</em><em> back to </em><em>my</em><em> house so </em><em>you</em><em> can eat bread and drink water.”</em> He was lying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>He went back with him and ate bread and drank water.<strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 13:11-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>As they were sitting at the table, a message from the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He cried out to the man from Judah, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says, </em><em>‘Because you’ve disobeyed </em><em>me</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>you</em><em>r body won’t go to your ancestors’ grave</em><em>.’”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>After he’d eaten bread and drunk <em>water</em>, he saddled the donkey for the prophet. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When he’d gone, a lion met him and killed him. It threw his body on the road with the donkey standing beside it. The lion stood by the body too. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Some men passed by and saw the body and the lion standing beside it. They went and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.      			     <strong>1</strong><strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Kg 13:20-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>When the prophet heard it, he said<em>, </em> <em>“It’s the man of God </em><em>that</em><em> disobeyed the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>; he let the lion </em><em>t</em><em>ear</em><em> him </em><em>apart like</em><em> </em><em>his</em><em> </em><em>message had said</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then he told his sons to saddle the donkey for him. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>He went and found the body on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion hadn’t eaten the body or torn the donkey. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>The old prophet picked up the body and laid it on his donkey. He brought it back to his city <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>and laid it in his own grave. They mourned for him, <em>“Ah</em><em>, my brother!”</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He told his sons, <em>“When I die, bury me where</em><em> I buried</em><em> the man of God.</em><em> </em><em>Lay my bones beside his.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>hat he cried </em><em>out </em><em>by the </em><em>message from</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> against the altar in Bethel and </em><em>the houses at</em><em> the high places in the </em><em>towns</em><em> of Samaria</em><em> will certainly happen</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>Even after all that, Jeroboam kept following his own sinful way. Anybody that volunteered, he ordained as a priest for the high places. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>What happened became the sin in his family that<em> </em>destroyed it.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	    </strong></span>
