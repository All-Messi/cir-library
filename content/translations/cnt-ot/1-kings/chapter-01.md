## 1 Kings Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When King David got old, they covered him with blankets, but he still had the chills. 2His advisers told him, "Let us look for a young virgin so she can attend you, become your nurse, and lie in your arms to keep you warm." 3They searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 4She became his nurse, but he didn't have relations with her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Adonijah son of Haggithfem pushed himself forward to make himself king. He prepared chariots and horsemen with 50 men to run ahead of him. 6His father had never crossed him by asking why he did something.  7He'd conferred with Joab son of Jeruiah and Abiathar the priest. They supported him. He was a handsome man, born after Absalom. 8But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and The Three most elite soldiers, who belonged to David, didn't join him. 9Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and young grain-fed animals by the Rock of Zoheleth next to En-rogel. He invited his half-brothers, the king's sons; and the men of Judah, the king's aides. 10But he didn't invite Nathan, Benaiah, The Three most elite soldiers, or his half-brother Solomon. 	1 Kg 1:1-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Nathan told Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Haven't you heard that Adonijah has become king, and David our lord doesn't know it? 12Take my advice and save your life and your son's life. 13Go right now to King David and say, 'Haven't you sworn to me that Solomon will be king after you? Why has Adonijah become king?' 14While you're there, I'll come in and confirm what you say."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Bathsheba went to the king's bedroom; Abishag was helping him. 16Bathsheba bowed low to him, and he asked, "What can I do for you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> She said, "You swore to me by the LORD your God that my son Solomon would be the next king. 18Adonijah has made himself king without you knowing it. 19He has sacrificed lots of oxen, grain-fed animals, and sheep and invited your sons Abiathar and Joab, but not Solomon. 20My lord the king, Israel is looking to you to tell them who will sit on your throne. 21Otherwise, as soon as you die, my son and I will be considered adversaries."	 1 Kg 1:11-21</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> While she was talking, Nathan came. 23They told the king, "Nathan's here." When he came in, he bowed low 24and said, "My lord the king, have you said Adonijah will be king? 25He's gone down today and sacrificed lots of oxen, grain-fed calves, and sheep and invited your sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar. They're eating and drinking with him, and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!' 26But he hasn't invited me, Zadok, Benaiah, or Solomon. 27Have you done this without telling us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> King David answered, "Call Bathsheba." She came in and faced him. 29He vowed, "As sure as the LORD lives who has redeemed me from distress, 30as sure as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel that your son Solomon would be king after me, I'll declare it publicly today."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> She bowed to the floor and said, "Long live my lord King David!"           1 Kg 1:22-31</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> David said, "Call Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah." When they came in, 33he told them, "Take my officials with you, have Solomon ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon. 34Have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king. Blow the ram's horn and say, 'Long live King Solomon!' 35Then come up behind him. He'll come and sit on my throne. I've appointed him to rule Israel and Judah."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Benaiah answered, "Amen! So may the LORD your God say, 37'As the LORD has been with you, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than yours!'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the king's bodyguard went down and had Solomon ride David's mule to Gihon. 39Zadok took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram's horn and the people said, "Long live King Solomon!" 40The people followed him up, playing flutes and celebrating. The ground shook at the sound of them.	 1 Kg 1:32-40</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Adonijah and his guests heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the ram's horn, he said, "Why is the city in such an uproar?" 42While he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar came. Adonijah said, "Come in, brave man with good news." 43But Jonathan answered, "No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 44He sent with him Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the king's bodyguard. They've had him ride the king's mule. 45Zadok and Nathan anointed him king at Gihon and have come up celebrating. That's why the city's in an uproar. 46Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne. 47The king's aides came to bless our lord King David and say, 'May your God make Solomon's name better than your name and his throne greater than yours!' 48The king also said, 'Bless the LORD God of Israel, who has granted a man to sit on my throne today while I can see it.'" 	1 Kg 1:41-48</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Adonijah's guests panicked and fled. 50Adonijah was scared of Solomon. He went and held onto the horns of the altar. 51Solomon heard, "Adonijah is scared. He's holding onto the horns of the altar and calling for you to swear to him that you won't put him to death." 52Solomon said, "If he'll be a worthy man, not a hair of his will fall to the ground. But if he does anything sinful, he'll die." 53King Solomon had them bring him down from the altar. He came and prostrated himself to Solomon. He told him to go on home.     	     	     1 Kg 1:49-53</span>
