## 1 Kings Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Kg 2:39-46</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> David died and they buried him in The City of David. 11He'd ruled Israel for 40 years, 7 in Hebron and 33 in Jerusalem. 12Solomon sat on his throne, and his kingdom became secure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Adonijah went to Bathsheba. 15"You know that the kingdom was mine as oldest heir and that Israel supposed I would be king. But the kingdom has been turned around and become my half-brother's; it was his from the LORD. 16I'm making one request. Don't refuse me." 17"Please speak to Solomon about giving me Abishag as a wife. He won't refuse you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Bathsheba went to King Solomon, and the king rose to meet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. Then he had a throne set for the queen mother on his right. 20She said, "I'm making one small request. Don't refuse me." 22"Why are you asking for Abishag for Adonijah? Ask for the kingdom too—because he's my older half-brother—even for him, Abiathar, and Joab!" 23Solomon swore by the LORD, "God do so to me and more if Adonijah hasn't said that against his own life. 24As sure as the LORD lives who made me secure on my father's throne and made me a family like he promised, I'll execute Adonijah today."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He sent Benaiah to execute him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then the king told Abiathar, "Go to your farm in Anathoth. You should die, but I won't do it now; you've carried the Ark of the Lord GOD in my father's presence and suffered everything he did."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest in fulfillment of the LORD's word about the descendants of Eli in Shiloh.	 1 Kg 2:19-27</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The news came to Joab because Joab followed Adonijah—though he hadn't followed Absalom. Joab fled to the LORD's tent and held onto the horns of the altar. 29King Solomon learned that he was beside the altar and sent Benaiah to execute him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Benaiah went and told him, "The king says to come out." 31"Do like he said and bury him so you can remove from me and my father's family the blood he shed for no reason. 32The LORD will be bringing his blood back on his own head. He fell on two men more upright than he was and killed them with the sword unbeknownst to my father: Abner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa, commander of Judah's army. 33Their blood will come back on the head of Joab and his descendants permanently. But may David, his descendants, his dynasty, and throne have lasting peace from the LORD." 	1 Kg 2:28-33</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Benaiah went up and fell on him, and they buried him at his house in the country. 35The king appointed Benaiah over the army and Zadok as priest to replace Abiathar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The king called for Shimei, "Build a house in Jerusalem and live here. 37If you cross the Kidron, you'll be responsible for your own death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> But three years later, two of his servants ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. People told him his servants were in Gath. 40He saddled his donkey, went to Achish in Gath to look for them, and brought them back. 41Solomon found out he'd gone, 42so he called him in, "Didn't I make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you that the day you went anywhere else you'd surely die? You agreed. 43Why not keep your oath to the LORD and my command? 44You've acknowledged your sin against my father; the LORD will bring it back on your own head. 45But I'll be blessed, and David's throne will be secure with the LORD permanently."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> The king told Benaiah to execute him. That's how the kingdom became secure for Solomon.</span>
