## 1 Kings Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. 2In the third year, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came down to visit the king of Israel. 3The king of Israel said to his officials, "Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we're still not doing anything to take it back from the king of Aram?" 4He asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?" Jehoshaphat said, "I'm like you, my troops like yours, my horses like yours." 5He added, "Let's ask first for a message from the LORD."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The king of Israel gathered the prophets—about 400 men, "Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there still a prophet of the LORD we can ask?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The king said, "There's still one, Micaiah son of Imlah, but I despise him; he never prophesies anything good about me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The two kings were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes at the threshing floor by the gate of Samaria. The prophets were prophesying there. 11Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns for himself and said, "The LORD says you'll gore the Arameans with these till they're consumed." 12The prophets were all prophesying, "Attack Ramoth-gilead. The LORD will deliver it to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The messenger to Micaiah told him, "The prophets agree in giving a favorable report to the king. Make your report like theirs."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But Micaiah swore, "As sure as the LORD lives, I'll say what he tells me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When he came, the king said, "Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth-gilead?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The king said, "How many times do I have to make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the LORD's name?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The king told Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you he wouldn't prophesy anything good about me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Micaiah said, "Listen to the LORD's message. I saw him on his throne and the host in heaven standing on his left and right. 20He said, 'Who will lure Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' One said this, another said that. 21Then a spirit came forward, 'I'll lure him.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Micaiah said, "The LORD has put a deceiving spirit in your prophets. He's declared disaster for you."	 1 Kg 22:18-23</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Zedekiah came up and hit him on the cheek, "How did the LORD's Spirit pass from me to speak to you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The king said, "Take Micaiah to Amon, governor of the city, and to Joash my son. 27Tell them the king says to put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water till I come back safely.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Micaiah said, "If you 'come back safely,' the LORD hasn't spoken by me. Listen to that, all of you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Ahab and Jehoshaphat went up against Ramoth-gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Ahab told Jehoshaphat, "I'll disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. 31The king of Aram had told the 32 captains of his chariots, "Don't fight anybody great or small except the king of Israel." 32When the captains saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they said, "That has to be the king of Israel," and they turned aside to attack him, and he cried out. 33When they saw it wasn't the king of Israel, they turned back.	 1 Kg 22:24-33</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> An Aramean archer drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel in a joint in the armor. He told the chariot driver, "Turn around and get me out of the fight. I'm seriously wounded." 35The battle raged that day; the king was propped up in his chariot in sight of the Arameans and died that evening. The blood from the wound ran down onto the bottom of the chariot. 36Then a shout went through the army just before sundown, "Every man to his city and country."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The king died; they took him to Samaria and buried him. 38They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood (where the prostitutes took baths) like the LORD had said. 39The rest of the acts of Ahab, the ivory palace he built, the towns he built are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 40His son Ahaziah became king.  	1 Kg 22:34-40</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king in Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel. 42He was 35 and ruled for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 43He followed the ways of Asa in doing what was right, but he didn't take away the high places. People sacrificed and burned incense there. 44He also made peace with the king of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the strength he showed in his rule, the wars he fought, are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 46He expelled from the land the remnant of shrine sodomites from his father's reign. 47There wasn't any king in Edom; a deputy served as king. 48Jehoshaphat built ships from Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn't make it; they wrecked at Ezion-geber. 49Then Ahab's son Ahaziah said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men go with yours in the ships." But Jehoshaphat wouldn't let them. 50He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Jehoram became king.	 1 Kg 22:41-50 51Ahaziah became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and ruled for 2 years. 52He did evil like his parents and JeroboamI that got Israel to sin. 53He served and worshiped Baal, and made the LORD God of Israel angry like his father had done.  	1 Kg 22:51-53</span>
