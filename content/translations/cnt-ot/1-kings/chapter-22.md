## 1 Kings Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>In the <strong>third year</strong>, <strong>Jehoshaphat</strong>, king of Judah, came down to visit the king of Israel. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The king of Israel said to his officials, <em>“Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we’re still not doing anything to take it </em><em>back </em><em>from the king of </em><em>Aram</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He asked Jehoshaphat, <em>“Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?”</em><em> </em> Jehoshaphat said, <em>“</em><em>I’m like</em><em> you, my </em><em>troops</em><em> </em><em>like yours, my horses like</em><em> your</em><em>s</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He added, <em>“</em><em>Let’s ask</em><em> first for </em><em>a message from</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>The king of Israel gathered the prophets—</span>
<p class="section-ref">about 400</p>

### men, “Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?”  “Yes, the LORD will deliver it to you.”


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>But Jehoshaphat said, <em>“Isn’t there still a prophet of the</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>we can </em><em>ask</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The king said, <em>“There’s still one</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>Micaiah son of Imlah, but I </em><em>despise</em><em> him</em><em>;</em><em> he </em><em>never</em><em> prophes</em><em>ies</em><em> </em><em>anything </em><em>good about me</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“Don’t say that.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 22:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>The two kings were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes at the threshing floor by the gate of Samaria. The prophets were prophesying there. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns for himself and said, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says y</em><em>ou’ll gore the </em><em>Aramea</em><em>ns </em><em>with these </em><em>till they’re consumed.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The prophets were all prophesying, <em>“Attack</em><em> Ramoth-gilead</em><em>. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will </em><em>deliver</em><em> it to </em><em>you</em><em>.”</em> <strong>Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The messenger to Micaiah told him<em>, “The prophets agree in giving a favorable report to the king.</em><em> Make</em><em> your </em><em>report</em><em> like theirs.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>But Micaiah swore, <em>“As </em><em>sure as </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives, I’ll say what </em><em>he</em><em> </em><em>tells</em><em> me.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>When he came, the king said, <em>“Micaiah, should we </em><em>attack</em><em> Ramoth-gilead?”</em><em> </em> He answered, <em>“Go right on up there! T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>is going to </em><em><u>deliver</u></em><em> it to </em><em>you!!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>The king said, <em>“How many time</em><em>s</em><em> do I have to </em><em>make you swear not </em><em>to </em><em>tell me anyt</em><em>hing but the truth in the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s </em><em>name?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>He said, <em>“</em><em>I saw Israel scattered on the mountains</em> <em>	</em><em>	l</em><em>ike sheep without a shepherd.</em> <em>	The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> said, ‘The</em><em>y</em><em> </em><em>don’t </em><em>have </em><em>a</em><em> master</em><em> </em>anymore<em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>	they need </em><em>to go home in peace.’”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 22:10-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The king told Jehoshaphat, <em>“Didn’t I tell you he wouldn’t prophesy anything good about me?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Micaiah said, <em>“</em><em>L</em><em>isten to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s message</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I saw </em><em>him on his throne and the host in </em><em>heaven standing on his left and right.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>He said,</em> <em>‘Who will </em><em>lure</em><em> Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’</em> <em>One said this, another said that.</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Then a spirit came forward,</em> <em>‘</em><em>I’ll </em><em>lure him.’</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>‘How?’</em> <em>‘By</em><em> be</em><em>ing</em><em> a deceiving spirit </em><em>in</em><em> his prophets.’</em><em> </em> <em>‘</em><em>Go do it.’</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Micaiah said, <em>“</em><em>T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has put a deceiving spirit in </em><em>your prophets.</em><em> </em><em>He’</em><em>s </em><em>declar</em><em>ed disaster for you.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 22:18-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Zedekiah came up and hit him on the cheek, <em>“How did the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s Spirit</em><em> pass </em><em>from</em><em> me to speak to you?”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>“You’ll see when you’re hiding in</em><em> an inner room.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>The king said, <em>“Take Micaiah to A</em><em>mon, governor of the city, and</em><em> to Joash </em><em>my son.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Tell them t</em><em>h</em><em>e king says to p</em><em>ut this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water till I </em><em>come back safely.</em><em>’”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Micaiah said, <em>“If you </em><em>‘</em><em>come back safely</em><em>,’</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> hasn’t spoken by me.</em><em> </em><em>Listen</em><em> </em>to that<em>, all of you.”</em> <strong>Ahab Killed in Battle</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup><em>Ahab </em>and <em>Jehoshaphat</em> went up against Ramoth-gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup><em>Ahab </em>told Jehoshaphat, <em>“I’ll disguise myself and go into the battle, but you </em><em>wear</em><em> </em><em>y</em><em>our </em>royal <em>robes.”</em><em> </em>So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The king of Aram had told</span>
<p class="section-ref">the 32</p>

### captains of his chariots, “Don’t fight anybody great or small except the king of Israel.” 32When the captains saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they said, “That has to be the king of Israel,” and they turned aside to attack him, and he cried out. 33When they saw it wasn’t the king of Israel, they turned back.	 1 Kg 22:24-33


<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>An <em>Aramean </em>archer drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel in a joint in the armor. He told the chariot driver, <em>“Turn aroun</em><em>d and get me out of the fight.</em><em> I’m seriously wounded.”</em> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>The battle raged that day; the king was propped up in his chariot in sight of the Arameans and died that evening. The blood from the wound ran down onto the bottom of the chariot. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Then a shout went through the army just before sundown, <em>“Every man to his city and </em><em>country.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>The king died; they took him to Samaria and buried him. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood (where the prostitutes took baths) like the LORD had said. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>The rest of the acts of Ahab, the ivory palace he built, the towns he built are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of </em><em>the </em><em>Kings of Israel</em>. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>His son <u>Ahaziah</u> became king. <strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### Jehoshaphat Rules in Judah


<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king in Judah in the <strong>fourth year of Ahab</strong>, king of Israel. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>He</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 35</p>

### and ruled for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 43He followed the ways of Asa in doing what was right, but he didn’t take away the high places. People sacrificed and burned incense there. 44He also made peace with the king of Israel.


<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the strength he showed in his rule, the wars he fought, are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah</em>. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>He expelled from the land the remnant of shrine sodomites from his father’s reign. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>There wasn’t any king in Edom; a deputy served as king. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>Jehoshaphat built ships from Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn’t make it; they wrecked at Ezion-geber. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>Then Ahab’s son Ahaziah said to Jehoshaphat, <em>“Let my </em><em>men</em><em> go with yours in the ships.”</em><em> </em>But Jehoshaphat wouldn’t let them. <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son <strong>Jehoram</strong> became king.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Ahaziah Rules in Israel


<span class="verse" id="v51"><sup><strong>51</strong></sup>Ahaziah became king of Israel in Samaria in the <strong>seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat</strong>, king of Judah, and ruled for <strong>2 years</strong>. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>He did evil like his parents and Jeroboam<strong><sup>I</sup></strong> that got Israel to sin. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>He served and worshiped Baal, and made the LORD God of Israel angry like his father had done.  <strong>	</strong></span>
