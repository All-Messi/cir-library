## Micah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits those who devise sin,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They covet fields and seize them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your enemies will taunt you with a proverb</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So you won't have anyone stretching out a surveying line</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Are you really saying such a thing, House of Jacob?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> My people rise up against my people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They evict my people's women from their pleasant homes</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Get up and get out of here!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> If a liar full of hot air tells you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The One that opens the gate will lead you out;</span>
