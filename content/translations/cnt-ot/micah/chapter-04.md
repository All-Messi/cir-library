<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the last days,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They'll say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He'll mediate between many nations</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Everyone will sit under their own vine and fig tree,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The nations conduct themselves</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll make the lame a remnant</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Your former dominion will revert to you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Writhe and groan, inhabitant of Zion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Now many nations have gathered against you, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But they don't know what I'm thinking</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Get up and thresh, Zion.</span>
