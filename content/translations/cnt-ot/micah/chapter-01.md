<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He's coming down from his place</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The mountains will mash down under his feet</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> That's because Jacob rebelled</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll make Samaria a pile of ruins in the countryside,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll smash its idols,</span>
