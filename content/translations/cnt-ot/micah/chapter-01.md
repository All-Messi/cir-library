## Micah Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Micah from Moresheth at <strong>the Time of Jotham, Ahaz, </strong><strong><em>and</em></strong><strong> Hezekiah, </strong><strong>K</strong><strong>ings of Judah.</strong> What He Saw About Samaria and Jerusalem 	<strong>Judgment Against Samaria and Jerusalem</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Listen, every nation; listen, world and everybody in it. Let the Lord GOD testify against you from his holy Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He’s coming down from his place to walk on the mountaintops.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The mountains will mash down under his feet and cascade into the valleys— like wax in a fire or water rushing on a slope.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 1:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> That’s because Jacob rebelled and Israel sinned. Where’s Jacob’s rebellion? Isn’t it <em>in </em>Samaria? Where’s Judah’s <em>main </em>high place? Isn’t it <em>in </em>Jerusalem?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I’ll make Samaria a pile of ruins in the countryside, a place to plant vineyards. I’ll drag the stones <em>of its walls</em> down to the valley and expose its foundations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I’ll smash its idols, and burn everything in it. I’ll destroy its images because they came from a prostitute’s pay; that’s all they’ll be.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 1:5-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Because of this, I’ll mourn and wail, and walk around barefoot and naked. I’ll howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> My people’s wound is too deep to heal; it’s penetrated into Judah all the way up to Jerusalem’s gates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Don’t “tell” it in Gath; don’t weep at all; roll in the “dust” at Beth-leaphrah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Just move on <em>into captivity </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em>naked and embarrassed, residents of Shaphir; the people in Zaaman don’t dare “come outside” its wall; there’s mourning in Beth-ezel because its people have no back up.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 1:8-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Those living in Maroth grow weak waiting for relief, because “bitter” calamity from the LORD is reaching the gates of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Harness a “team of horses” to a chariot and flee, people in Lachish, where Zion’s sin came from, where Israel’s rebellious acts spread from <em>into Judah</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses in Achzib have “deceived” the kings in Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I’ll bring a “conqueror” on you, people of Mareshah; Israel’s leaders will flee to <em>the cave of </em>Adullam.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Shave off your hair <em>in despair </em>for the children you delight in; make yourself as bald as an eagle because they’re going into exile.</span>
