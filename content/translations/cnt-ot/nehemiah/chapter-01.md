## Nehemiah Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Memoirs of Nehemiah Son of Hacaliah Report from Jerusalem In the month Chislev, the twentieth year, I was in Susa, the capital. 2Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men came from Judah. I asked them about the Jews that had survived the captivity and about Jerusalem. 3They told me, "The remnant in the province is in dire straits and dishonor. The wall around Jerusalem has been torn down and its gates burned." Nehemiah's Prayer</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When I heard it, I sat down and cried and mourned for days. I fasted and prayed,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> "LORD God of heaven, great awesome God that keeps covenant and enduring love for those who love you and keep your commandments, 6let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to my praying day and night for the Israelites your servants, and for confessing our sins against you. Even I and my father's family have sinned. 7We've acted corruptly and not kept the commandments, statutes, or ordinances you gave Moses. 8Remember your promise to him, 'If you're not faithful, I'll scatter you among the nations. 9But if you come back to me and keep my commandments—though scattered beyond the horizons—I'll gather you up and bring you to the place where I've put my name.' 10They're the people you've redeemed by your power and strength. 11Please listen to my prayer and the prayer of your servants who delight in honoring you. Make me successful today; grant me mercy from this man." I was the king's cupbearer. Nehemiah Sent to Jerusalem</span>
