## Nehemiah Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The wall had been rebuilt, and I'd set up the doors and appointed gatekeepers, singers, and Levites. 2I put Hanani my brother—along with Hananiah commander of the fortress—in charge of Jerusalem because he was a reliable man that respected God more than most. 3I told them, "Don't open the gates till the sun is hot. While they're standing guard, shut and bolt the doors. Appoint guards from the people that live inside Jerusalem, each at his post by his own house."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The city was big and open, but there weren't many people in it, and houses hadn't been built.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then God put it in my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. I found the scroll with the genealogies for the ones that came up first; it read as follows: 6-7the number of Israelites that came back to Jerusalem and Judah with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah: 46the Temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth, 47Keros, Sia, Padon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Lebana, Hagaba, Shalmai, 49Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, 50Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, 51Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah, 52Besai, Meunim, Nephushesim, 53Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, 54Bazlith, Mahida, 57the sons of Solomon's servants: the descendants of Sotai, Sophereth, Perida, 58Jaala, Darkon, Giddel, 59Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth-hazzebaim, and Amon. 60All the Temple servants and sons of Solomon's servants numbered 		392. 61These were the ones that came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but couldn't show that their ancestors' houses or their descendants were from Israel: 62the sons of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 	642. 63from the priests: the families of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, Barzillai. (This Barzillai had married a daughter of Barzillai from Gileadite and took his name.) 64They searched the genealogical records but couldn't find their names. So they were considered unqualified and excluded from the priesthood. 65The governor told them not to eat the priests' portion of the sacrifices till a priest arose with Urim and Thummim. 66The whole assembly numbered 	42,360, 68They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 69435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys. 70The governor donated to the treasury 19 lbs 1,000 drachmas of gold, 50 basins, and 530 priests' vestments. 71For the work, some leaders of families donated to the treasury 375 lbs 20,000 darics of gold and 2,750 lbs 2,200 minas of silver. 72The rest of the people gave 375 lbs 20,000 drachmas of gold, 2,500 lbs 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priests' vestments. 73The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, some of the people, the Temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns.</span>
