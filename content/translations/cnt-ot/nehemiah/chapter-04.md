## Nehemiah Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he was furious and ridiculed the Jews. 2In front of his relatives and wealthy men in Samaria, he asked, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Can they remake something out of the charred stones from dusty rubble?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Tobiah the Ammonite was close by and said, "Even a fox could jump on that stone wall they're building and break it down!" 4"Listen how they despise us, God! Turn their mockery back on their heads and give them up for plunder in a land that takes them captive. 5Don't forgive them; don't blot out their sin. They've tried to demoralize the builders."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We were able to join the whole wall together to half its original height because the people were willing to work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that repairing the walls was continuing and that we were closing up the breaks in it. They were really mad. 8They conspired to fight Jerusalem and create confusion in it, 9but we prayed to God and set up a guard day and night. 10The people from Judah were saying, "The laborers were getting worn out, but there's still a lot of rubble to move. We can't rebuild the wall ourselves."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Our enemies said, "They won't know it till we attack them, kill them, and stop the work." 12When the Jews that lived close to them came and told us ten times, "They'll come up against us from every direction," 13I stationed men behind the wall in the lowest parts, the exposed places. I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows. 14When I saw how afraid they were, I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "You don't have to be afraid of them. Remember our great awesome Lord. Fight for your brothers, your children, your wives and houses."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When our enemies heard that we knew about their plans and that God had frustrated it, each of us went back to work on the wall. 16From then on, half of my men worked while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the people of Judah. 17The ones that were rebuilding the wall and carrying burdens did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other. 18Each one attached his sword to his side as he built while the bugler stood close to me. 19I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is important and extensive, and we're a long way apart on the wall. 20Wherever you hear the bugle, rally there. Our God will fight for us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> We carried out the work with half of them holding spears from dawn till the stars came out. 22I told the people then, "Each man and his servant, spend the night inside Jerusalem so you can be guards at night and workmen during the day." 23I, my brothers, servants, and guards didn't change clothes. Everybody kept a weapon on them.</span>
