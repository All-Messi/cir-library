## Nehemiah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the <strong>month Nisan, twentieth year of King Artaxerxes</strong>, wine was present, and I took it up to him. I hadn’t been sad in his presence <em>before</em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So he asked <em>me</em>, <em>“Why do you look sad, but you’re not sick?</em><em> </em><em>This is nothing but sadness </em><em>in </em><em>you</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> I was apprehensive. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Long</em><em> live the King! Why w</em><em>ouldn’t I look sad when the city </em><em>where</em><em> my </em><em>ancestors are buried lies in ruins</em><em> and its gates </em><em>are </em><em>burned?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I delivered the king’s letters to the governors of Beyond the River. He’d sent officers of the army and cavalry for my protection. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, they didn’t like it that someone had come to help the Israelites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I arrived at Jerusalem and was there three days. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Then I and a few men got up during the night without telling anybody what God had put in my mind to do for Jerusalem. The only animal with us was the one I was riding. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I went out by the Valley Gate toward the Dragon’s Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls that were torn down and the gates that were burned up. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there wasn’t any way for the animal I was riding to get past. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>I went up the valley and inspected the wall. Then I went in the Valley Gate again and came back. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The officials didn’t know where I’d gone or what I’d done. I hadn’t told the Jews, the priests, nobles, officials, or anyone that would be doing the work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then I told them, <em>“You can</em><em> see the bad situation we’re in. </em><em>Jerusalem </em><em>lie</em><em>s </em><em>in ruins;</em><em> its gates are burned.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s rebuild the wall so we </em><em>can put an end to this disgrace</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I told them how God had helped me, and what the king had told me. They said, <em>“Let’s build”</em>; so they started on the good work. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and despised us, <em>“What are you doing?</em><em> </em><em>Re</em><em>volt</em><em>ing against the king?”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>I answered them, <em>“The God of heaven will give us success.</em><em> W</em><em>e</em><em>,</em><em> his servants</em><em>,</em><em> will </em><em>do the building;</em><em> you </em><em>don’t </em><em>have </em><em>any</em><em> </em><em>part</em><em>, </em><em>any legal or historical claim</em><em> in Jerusalem.”</em><strong>     </strong><strong>	                                                                                       </strong><strong>Neh</strong><strong> 2:9-20</strong> <strong>Rebuilding the Wall</strong><strong>s</strong></span>
