## Nehemiah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>There was a loud outcry by husbands and wives against their fellow Jews. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Some were saying, <em>“There are a lot of us along with our sons and daughters.</em><em> We need more food to survive</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Others said, <em>“We’re mortgaging our fields, </em><em>vineyards, and houses for</em><em> grain because of the famine.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> </em>others were saying, <em>“We’ve borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>O</em><em>ur</em><em> flesh is like our brothers</em><em>’ flesh</em><em>, our children like their children</em><em>; yet we’</em><em>re forcing our </em><em>children</em><em> to be slaves</em><em>. S</em><em>ome of our daughters have already been forced into slavery</em><em>. We’</em><em>re helpless because </em><em>we’ve mortgaged </em><em>our fields and vineyards to other people.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I was irate when I heard their outcries. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I thought it over and contended with the nobles and rulers, <em>“You’re </em><em>charging </em><em>your </em><em>fellow Jews interest?</em><em>!</em><em>” </em>I convened a large assembly against them <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and said, <em>“As far as we were able, we’ve</em><em> redeemed our Jewish brother</em><em>s that were sold to Gentiles. W</em><em>ould you eve</em><em>n sell your fellow Jews so they can</em><em> be sold to us?”</em><em> </em> <em>	</em>They couldn’t think of anything to say. <strong>	</strong><strong>	           </strong><strong>Neh</strong><strong> 5:1-8</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Again I said, <em>“</em><em>What </em><em>you’re doing is </em><em>not right</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Shouldn’t you fear God </em><em>over</em><em> the </em><em>mockery by</em><em> </em><em>other</em><em> nations, our enemies?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>, my brothers, and servants</em><em> are </em><em>also </em><em>lending them money and grain.</em><em> Quit charging interest! </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Right</em><em> now, g</em><em>ive </em><em>them </em><em>back their fields, vineyard</em><em>s</em><em>, olive groves, houses, the hundredth part </em><em>of the money and grain, new wine, and</em><em> </em><em>olive </em><em>oil that you’</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em> been</em><em> </em><em>taxing</em><em> </em><em>them.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They said they’d do it<em>.</em><em> </em>I called the priests and made them swear to it. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I shook out the front of my garment, <em>“May God shake out e</em><em>very man’s house and </em><em>possessions </em><em>who doesn’t fulfill that oath. M</em><em>ay he shake</em><em> him</em><em> out this way and empt</em><em>y him</em><em>.”</em> The assembly said, <em>“Amen!”</em> and praised the LORD. The offenders did what they vowed.<strong>	</strong><strong>	   </strong><strong>Neh</strong><strong> 5:9-13</strong> <strong>Nehemiah’s Generosity</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> From the day the king appointed me governor of Judah, my kinsmen and I had never eaten the governor’s food allowance—from the <strong>twentieth to thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes</strong> (12 years). <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The former governors had laid burdens on the people and took bread and wine from them besides 1 lb <sup>40 </sup><sup>shekels</sup> of silver. Even their assistants lorded it over the people. I didn’t do that because I respected God. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>I applied myself to the work on the wall. We didn’t buy any land; my servants gathered there to work. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides those who came from nations around. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I had an ox and six choice sheep prepared each day as well as birds; every ten days I provided wine in abundance. But I still didn’t demand the governor’s food allowance; the people were in heavy servitude. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>God, remember me for the good I’ve done for them.<strong>	      </strong><strong>	  </strong><strong>Neh</strong><strong> 5:14-19</strong> <strong>Conspiracy Against Nehemiah</strong></span>
