## Nehemiah Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On the twenty-fourth of that month, the Israelites gathered with fasting in burlap and doused with dust. 2They separated from foreigners and confessed their and their ancestors' sins. 3While they stood in their place, they read from the Law for a fourth of the day. For another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God. 4On the Levites' platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and appealed to the LORD their God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You alone are the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You're the LORD God</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You found him faithful</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You separated the sea</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You led them during the day with a pillar of cloud</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then you came down on Mount Sinai</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You told them about your holy Sabbath</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You gave them bread from the sky for their hunger</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They didn't remember the awesome deeds</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Even when they made a calf out of molten metal</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You gave them your good Spirit to teach them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> For 40 years you provided for them in the desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You delivered kingdoms and nations to them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You made their descendants as numerous as the stars</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So their descendants went in and took possession of it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They captured fortified towns and a fertile land;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So you delivered them to their oppressors;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But as soon as they got comfortable,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> But you bore with them for many years</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> But in your great mercy</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> You're justified in everything that's happened to us,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> But they, in their own kingdom,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> We're slaves today</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Its abundant produce is for the kings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Because of that, we're signing a covenant;</span>
