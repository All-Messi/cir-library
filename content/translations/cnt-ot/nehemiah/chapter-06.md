## Nehemiah Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies found out I’d rebuilt the wall so there wasn’t any break in it—although I hadn’t set up the doors in the gates yet. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message<em>, </em><em>“M</em><em>eet </em><em>us at Chephirim in the P</em><em>lain of Ono.</em><em>” </em>They were planning to harm me. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I sent messengers, <em>“I’m </em><em>in an extensive project</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>W</em><em>hy should the work stop while I’m with </em><em>you?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They sent me four messages like that; I answered them the same way. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then Sanballat sent his servant a fifth time with an open letter in hand. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He’d written, <em>“It’s reported among the </em><em>countries—</em><em>an</em><em>d Gashmu tells me it’s true—</em><em>that you an</em><em>d the Jews plan to revolt; that’s why</em><em> you’re rebuilding the wall.</em><em> Those reports say y</em><em>ou’</em><em>ll</em><em> </em><em>be their king</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> also appointed prophets to </em><em>make a declaration in Jerusalem about </em><em>you, ‘</em><em>There’s a king </em><em>in Judah!’</em><em> Those reports</em><em> will be </em><em>passed on</em><em> to the king.</em><em> Come</em><em>; let’s </em><em>talk about it</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong>	     </strong><strong>	    </strong><strong>Neh</strong><strong> 6:1-7</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I sent him a message, <em>“</em><em>We haven’t done</em><em> </em><em>things </em><em>like what</em><em> </em><em>you’re saying. You’ve made</em><em> them</em><em> up</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They were trying to scare us so we’d<em> </em>get discouraged and quit<em>.</em><em> </em>But now, God, give me courage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, <em>“Let’s meet in </em><em>God’s Temple</em><em> </em><em>and</em><em> close the doors</em><em>; they’re going to come during the</em><em> night to kill you.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>I said, <em>“Should a man like me </em><em>run to</em><em> the </em><em>Temple</em><em> to save </em><em>my</em><em> life? I</em><em> won’t do that</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I sensed that God hadn’t sent him. He gave me that warning because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>to scare me so I’d act accordingly and sin. They’d have a bad report to accuse me of. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they’ve done, as well as Noadiah the prophetess, and the other prophets that were trying to scare me.      		        <strong>Neh</strong><strong> 6:8-14</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The wall was completed on the <strong>twenty-fifth of the month Elul</strong> (in 52 days). <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When our enemies heard it and the nations around us saw it, they lost their confidence. They recognized that our God had helped accomplish the work. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>During that time lots of letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the nobles in Judah. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Many in Judah were bound to him under oath because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>In addition, they kept telling me about the good things he’s done and reporting to him how I responded. Tobiah kept sending letters to intimidate me.    <strong> </strong><strong>Neh</strong><strong> 6:15-19</strong> <strong>The Wall</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Are</strong><strong> Finished</strong></span>
