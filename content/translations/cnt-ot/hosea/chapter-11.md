## Hosea Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Israel was young, I loved him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The more I called him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But I was the One that taught Ephraim to walk,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I led him with the leashes of mercy and bonds of love;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The sword will rage against their towns;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So my people are intent on turning away from me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I won't act on my fierce anger</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They'll follow me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They'll come fluttering like birds from Egypt,</span>
