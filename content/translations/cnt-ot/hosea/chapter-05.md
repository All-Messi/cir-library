<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hear this, priests!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You rebels have gone deep in slaughter,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I know what you're doing, Ephraim;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your deeds keep you from coming back to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They'll go with their flocks and herds</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They've dealt deviously with the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Ephraim will become a pile of rubble when he's rebuked;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Judah's officials are like people that remove landmarks;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed in condemnation,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So I'll be like a moth in Ephraim,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll be like a lion to Ephraim,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll go back to my place</span>
