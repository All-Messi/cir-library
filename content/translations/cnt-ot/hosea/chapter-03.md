## Hosea Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the LORD told me, "Go love your wife again even though she's an adulteress—like I love Israel though it turns to other gods and loves raisin cakes." 2So I bought her for 6 oz 15 shekels of silver and 5 bushels a lethek of barley. 3I told her, "You'll have to stay with me a long time. You won't carry on prostitution or belong to another man. I'll be that way with you too." 4That's because the people in Israel will go a long time without king or prince, sacrifice or sacred pillar, ephod or household idols. 5Then they'll come back and rely on the LORD their God and David their king. They'll come cringing to the LORD and to his goodness in the end.</span>
