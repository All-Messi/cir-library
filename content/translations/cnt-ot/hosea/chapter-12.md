## Hosea Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ephraim feeds on wind, and constantly chases after the east wind; he piles up lies and violence; he even makes an alliance with Assyria while he’s carrying olive oil to Egypt to buy help. 	<strong>The </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong>’s</strong><strong> Indictment Against Israel and Judah</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh has a dispute with Judah too; he’ll punish Jacob in proportion to his “deceit.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> In the womb he grabbed his brother’s heel; when he grew up, he even wrestled with God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He wrestled with an angel and prevailed; he cried and begged his blessing. He found him at Bethel and spoke to him there—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh God of Hosts, Yahveh is his name.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Hos 12:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So come back to your God, observe kindness and justice; depend on him always.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But he’s become a shrewd businessman with false balances, who loves to oppress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Ephraim has said, <em>“I</em><em> got </em><em>rich;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>I made myself wealthy.</em> <em>	Nobody caught me being </em><em>dishonest</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>that would </em><em>have made it</em><em> </em><em>illegal!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“</em><strong><em>I’ve</em></strong><strong><em> been </em></strong><strong><em>Yahveh</em></strong><strong><em> your God since </em></strong><strong><em>Egypt</em></strong><em>;</em> <em>	I’ll make you </em><em>live</em><em> in tents again</em> <em>	</em><em>	as at the Festival of Booths.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>I’ve</em><em> spoken to the prophets</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>and given them lots of </em><em>visions;</em> <em>	I’ve delivered parables through them.</em><em>”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Hos 12:6-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But there’s sinfulness in Gilead, worthless <em>people</em>. They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal too; their altars are like rock piles along a plowed field.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jacob fled to the land of Aram and kept sheep to get a wife.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then Yahveh brought his descendants out of Egypt by a prophet and protected them by him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But they’ve made <em>Yahveh</em> bitterly angry; so he’s sentenced them to death in payment for their disgrace.</span>
