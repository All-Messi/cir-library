## Hosea Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In that day, you will call your brothers 'Ammi' [my people]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> But for now, bring charges against your mother Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Otherwise, I'll strip her naked</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I won't have mercy on her children;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Their mother was a prostitute;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So I'll plant thornbushes along the sides of her road</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> She'll chase after her lovers, but not catch them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> She doesn't know I was the one</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So I'll take back my grain at harvest time</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'll uncover her lewdness</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'll put an end to her gaiety,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll destroy her grapevines and fig trees</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll punish her for the times when she was</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll give her vineyards there</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> She'll call me 'Ishi' [my husband], not 'Baali' [my lord].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll take the many names of Baal out of her mouth;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll make a treaty for her with the animals in the field,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I'll engage her to me permanently</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> At that time, I'll answer the sky</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I'll 'sow' her for myself in the land</span>
