## Hosea Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Ephraim spoke, people cringed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Now his people sin more and more</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So they'll be like morning mist,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I took care of you in the desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But when you got to pasture,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So I'll be like a lion to you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll attack you like a bear robbed of her cubs</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Where's your king</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I gave you a king in my anger</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The pains of childbirth have come on him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Though he's flourishing like a reed,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Samaria will bear the consequences of his guilt</span>
