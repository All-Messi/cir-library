<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Where’s your former enduring love</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Remember the scorn your servants endure,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup class="verse-num">52</sup> Bless the LORD forever!</span>
