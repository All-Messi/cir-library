<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Even a sparrow finds a home for herself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How blessed they are who live in your Temple</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> How blessed people are whose strength comes from you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> As they pass through the Valley of Weeping,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They grow from strength to more strength</span>
