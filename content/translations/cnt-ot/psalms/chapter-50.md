## Psalms Chapter 50

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God, the Mighty One, the LORD, has spoken and calls to earth from sunrise to sunset.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He shines forth out of Zion in perfect beauty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Our God comes; he doesn’t stay quiet; a fire consumes in front of him; a storm rages around him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He calls on the sky above and the earth beneath to witness the judgment of his people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Gather my people to me that I’ve made a covenant with by sacrifice.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The heavens declare his justice because God himself is judge.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 50:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Listen, my people, and I’ll speak; Israel, I’ll bring my charges against you. I’m God, your God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I don’t have any complaint about your sacrifices or burnt offerings that are always in front of me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But I don’t need any bulls from your barns or male goats from your pens;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> every animal in the forest already belongs to me, the livestock on a thousand hills.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I know every bird in the mountains; everything that moves in the field is mine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If I was hungry, I wouldn’t say anything to you about it, because the whole world belongs to me and everything in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Will I eat the meat of bulls or drink the blood of male goats?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Offer to me a sacrifice of thanksgiving; keep your vows to the Most High.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Call on me when there’s trouble; then I’ll rescue you, and you’ll honor me.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 50:7-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But God says to the sinful, “What reason do you have to recite my statutes or discuss my covenant?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You hate discipline and disregard what I tell you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Thieves are your friends; you associate with adulterers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You give your mouth free reign; your tongue tells lies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You sit around and gossip about your brother; you slander your mother’s son.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I didn’t speak up when you did those things, so you thought it didn’t matter to me; but now I’ll charge you and lay out my case against you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 50:16-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Consider this, you that forget about me, or I’ll tear you to pieces, and there won’t be anyone to save you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Giving thanks is the sacrifice that honors me; I’ll show you my deliverance if you keep to my path.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 50:22-23</p>
