## Psalms Chapter 107

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Be grateful to the LORD because he’s good;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Let his redeemed say it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Some wandered in trackless desert</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Hungry and thirsty,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He satisfies the thirsty</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Some sat in darkness and death’s shadow,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So he humbled them with labor;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and death’s shadow</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Some were fools</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The very sight of food was repulsive to them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He sent his message to heal them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Some went down to ships by the sea</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He spoke and a storm arose</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They reeled and staggered like drunks;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He stilled the storm and calmed the waves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then they were happy because they had quiet;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Let them extol him in front of the community</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He transforms rivers into desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> But he transforms a desert into a sea,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> He enables hungry people to live there</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He blesses them and they multiply;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When they’re decreased and brought low</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> But he sets the needy safely on high away from adversity</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The godly see it and are happy,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Who is wise? Pay attention to these things</span>
