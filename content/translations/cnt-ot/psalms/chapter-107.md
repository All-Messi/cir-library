<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>Be grateful to</strong><strong> the </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> because he’s good;</strong> <strong>	his love endures forever.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Let his redeemed say it, the ones he rescued from their adversaries</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>and gathered from other countries east and west, north and south.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Some wandered in trackless desert and couldn’t find their way to any inhabited city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted inside them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><strong>Then they </strong><strong>appealed</strong><strong> to the </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> in their trouble</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>	and he delivered them from </strong><strong>it;</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>he led them straight to a city they could live in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup><strong>They need to thank him for his enduring love</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	and his </strong><strong>awesome</strong><strong> acts for </strong><strong>his people</strong><strong>!</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.<strong>	Ps </strong><strong>107:4-9</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Some sat in darkness and death’s shadow, prisoners suffering in iron shackles,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>because they’d rebelled against what God said and spurned the advice of the Most High.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>So he humbled them with labor; they stumbled and nobody was there to help.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><strong>Then they </strong><strong>appealed</strong><strong> to the </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> in their trouble,</strong> <strong>	and he </strong><strong>delivered them from it.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He brought them out of darkness and death’s shadow <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and broke their chains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup><strong>They need to thank him for his enduring love</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	and his </strong><strong>awesome</strong><strong> acts for </strong><strong>his people</strong><strong>!</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>because he shattered bronze gates and cut iron bars in two.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:10-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><strong>Some </strong>were fools and suffered because they rebelled and sinned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The very sight of food was repulsive to them; they came close to dying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><strong>Then they </strong><strong>appealed</strong><strong> to the </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> in their trouble,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	and he delivered them from distress.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He sent his message to heal them and delivered them from destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup><strong>They need to thank him for his enduring love</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	and his wonderful acts for </strong><strong>his people</strong><strong>!</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and tell about his deeds with joyful singing.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:17-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><strong>Some </strong>went down to ships by the sea and did business on the ocean;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>they, too, have seen what the LORD can do, his powerful acts on the great deep.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>He spoke and a storm arose that whipped up the waves,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><em>waves</em> that swelled up toward the sky and crashed down to the depths; sailors’ courage melted away in their terror.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>They reeled and staggered like drunks; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>they were at their wits’ end<strong>.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><strong>Then they </strong><strong>appealed</strong><strong> to the </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> in their trouble,</strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong>and he </strong><strong>delivered</strong><strong> them </strong><strong>from</strong><strong> distress.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>He stilled the storm and calmed the waves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Then they were happy because they had quiet; so he guided them to the port they desired.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup><strong>They need to thank him for his enduring love</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	and his wonderful acts for </strong><strong>his people</strong><strong>!</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>Let them extol him in front of the community and praise him at the elders’ seats.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:23-32</p>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>He transforms rivers into desert, springs into thirsty ground,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>productive land into a salt waste because sinful people live there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>But he transforms a desert into a sea, dry land into springs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>He enables hungry people to live there and build a city,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>sow fields, plant vineyards, and gather a big harvest.<strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:33-37</p>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>He blesses them and they multiply; he keeps the <em>number of</em> their livestock from decreasing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>When they’re decreased and brought low through oppression, misery, and sorrow,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>he pours contempt on their rulers and makes them wander in trackless wasteland.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>But he sets the needy safely on high away from adversity and makes their families like a flock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>The godly see it and are happy, but bad people don’t have anything they can say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>Who is wise? Pay attention to these things and think about the LORD’s enduring love.<strong>	</strong></span>
