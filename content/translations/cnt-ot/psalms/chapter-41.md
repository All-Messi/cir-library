<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I said, “Be gracious to me, LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My enemies say rude things about me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When they come to visit me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Everybody that hates me whispers behind my back</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He has some deadly disease;</span>
