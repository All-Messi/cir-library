## Psalms Chapter 125

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Like mountains surround Jerusalem,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Sinners won’t rule</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The LORD does good to those who do good,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But those who turn aside to their crooked ways,</span>
