<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Listen to me, rescue me quickly; be a rock for me, a strong fortress to save me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You’re my rock and fortress; for your honor, lead me and guide me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Free me out of the trap people secretly laid for me because you’re my protection.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I’m entrusting my spirit to you; rescue me, LORD, true God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 31:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I detest those who respect worthless idols; I trust in you, LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I’ll be happy in your enduring love, because you see my difficulties and know the trouble I’m in,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> because you haven’t handed me over to my enemies; you’ve set me on a spacious place.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 31:6-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Be gracious to me in my distress, LORD; my eyes are melting away with grief, my soul and body are getting weak as well</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> because I live in constant sorrow; I spend my years in sighing. My strength is failing because of sin; my body is wasting away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Because I have so many enemies, my neighbors despise me, my acquaintances abhor me, and people shun me in the streets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I’m forgotten like someone long dead, out of mind like a broken pot.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I hear people’s slander; there’s terror on every side; my enemies conspire against me and lay plots to kill me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 31:9-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But I trust you, LORD; I swear, “You’re my God.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> My future’s in your hands; rescue me from my enemies, from those who persecute me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Smile at me; save me with your enduring love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don’t let my enemies disgrace me, LORD, because I’m calling on you. Put sinners to disgrace; let them be silent in Sheol.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Make lying lips be mute that insult the good with pride and contempt.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 31:14-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> How great your goodness is that you’ve stored up for those who respect you, that you’ve shown to people that take refuge in you so others can see.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You secretly hide them with you away from people’s plots, and shelter them from the conflict that tongues can cause.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Bless the LORD because he showed me his enduring love when I was surrounded like a city under siege.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I despaired in my alarm, “I can’t see you!” but you heard my appeal.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 31:19-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Love the LORD, all you holy people! He preserves the faithful and repays those who act arrogantly.</span>
