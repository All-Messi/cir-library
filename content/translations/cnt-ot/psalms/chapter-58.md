## Psalms Chapter 58

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Leaders, do you decree what’s right?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> No, you plot injustice in your hearts</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The sinful go astray from the womb;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They have venom like vipers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pull out their fangs, God;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Make them disappear like water that drains away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Make sinners be like snails that dissolve as they go along,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of burning briers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Good people will celebrate when they see God pay them back;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> People will say, “There’s surely a reward for good people;</span>
