<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Say to him, “What you do is so awesome! Your enemies feign obedience to you out of fear for your power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> All the earth worships you and praises you; they sing praises to you.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He turned the Red Sea into dry ground; the people crossed through the Jordan on foot; they celebrated over him there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He rules by his power forever; he keeps watch over the nations; the rebellious don’t make an uprising.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You put a ruler over us and passed us through fire and water; yet you brought us out into a large place.</span>
