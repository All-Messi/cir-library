## Psalms Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>Why are you so far from helping me, so far from my groaning?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>I call out in the daytime, but you don’t answer; I don’t get any relief at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Yet you’re holy, enthroned on Israel’s praises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Our ancestors trusted in you, and you delivered them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>They called out to you, and you saved them; they relied on you, and you didn’t disappoint them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>But I’m a worm, not a man; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>people scorn me and despise me.<strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Everybody that sees me makes fun of me; they make faces at me and shake their heads at me <em>and say</em><em>,</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Entrust yourself to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>; let him deliver you;</em> <em>	</em><em>	let him rescue </em><em>you because he delights in you!</em><em>”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Yet you’re the One that delivered me from the womb and made me trust when I was on my mother’s breasts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>I’ve depended on you from birth; you’ve been my God from my mother’s womb.<strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:6-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Don’t be distant because trouble’s near; there’s nobody else to help me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Many bulls have surrounded me; fierce bulls from Bashan have gathered around me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>They bellow at me like ravening, roaring lions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>I’m being poured out like water; all my bones are out of joint; my heart’s melting like wax.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>My strength has dried up like a potsherd, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>my tongue is sticking to my jaws, and you’ve laid me down dead in the dust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Dogs have surrounded me; an crowd has ganged up on me; they’ve pierced my hands and feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>I can count all my bones; <em>people</em> are staring at me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>they’re dividing up my clothes and gambling for my garments.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:11-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Don’t be distant, LORD; you’re my only help; hurry and help me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Deliver me from the sword; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>rescue me from the dog’s paws;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>save me from the lion’s mouth and the wild ox’s horns.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:19-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>I’ll tell my brothers about you and praise you when your people gather.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>You that respect the LORD, praise him; stand in awe of him, descendants of Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>because he hasn’t looked down on the oppressed or ignored them; when they’ve appealed to him for help, he’s listened. <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:22-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>The theme of my praise in the great assembly comes from you; I’ll fulfill my vows in front of people that respect you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>The poverty-stricken will eat and be satisfied; those who rely on the LORD will praise him. May their hearts live forever!<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:25-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>The most distant places will remember and turn to the LORD; all the families in the nations will worship him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>because the kingdom belongs to him; he rules the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Prosperous people will eat and worship; everyone that goes down to dust will bow to him, all those who can’t keep themselves alive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Posterity will serve him; one generation will tell the next one about him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>To people not yet born, they’ll come to declare his goodness, that he’s the One that’s done all of this.</span>
