<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He put a new song in me, a song about praising God; other people will hear it, see what he’s done, and trust in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How blessed people are that trust in the LORD instead of turning to proud or deceitful people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> LORD my God, you’ve done so many amazing things; your good intentions for us are too many to tell. Nobody compares with you; if I tried to tell about your wonderful acts, I couldn’t recount them all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In the great assembly I’ve proclaimed the good news about goodness I didn’t hold back</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> or keep to myself the truth about your goodness; I spoke openly about your saving power, about your enduring love and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> LORD, please hurry and help me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Embarrass and humiliate those who keep trying to destroy me; disgrace the ones that delight in hurting me.</span>
