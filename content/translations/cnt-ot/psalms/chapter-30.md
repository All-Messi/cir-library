## Psalms Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I’ll praise you, LORD, because you’ve rescued me; you haven’t let my enemies celebrate victory over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I appealed to you for help, my God, and you restored my health;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> you brought me up from Sheol; you kept me from going down to the Pit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Sing praise to the LORD, his holy people; thank him, 5because his anger is only for a little while, but his blessing lasts a lifetime. Weeping may go on all night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 30:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In my good fortune, I said, “I’ll never be shaken.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your blessing, LORD, made me feel as stable as a mountain; but then you hid from me, and I was shattered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I called out to you in a petition:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What does my death accomplish if you let me go down to the Pit? Will dust praise you and tell about your faithfulness?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Hear me, LORD; be gracious and help me.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You turned my mourning into dancing; you removed my burlap of mourning and dressed me in happiness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Now I can sing praise to you unrestrained; I can be eternally grateful to you.</span>
