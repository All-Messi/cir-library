<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> LORD, oppose the ones that oppose me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Put on buckler and shield,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Draw spear and javelin against my pursuers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Dishonor the ones that want to kill me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Make them like chaff in the wind,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Make their path dark and slippery,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Bring destruction on them unawares;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I’ll be happy in the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> My very bones say, “LORD, who is like you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Malicious witnesses testify against me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They repay me bad for good; I’m heartbroken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But when they were sick, I wore burlap;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I went about as if it was my friend or brother;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But when I stumbled, they celebrated and ganged up on me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Like godless jesters at a feast,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Lord, how long will you just watch?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Don’t let my enemies celebrate over me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They don’t talk about peace;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They open their mouth wide against me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You can see what they’re doing, LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Stir yourself up, awake for my justice,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Judge me, LORD, according to your goodness;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don’t let them say to themselves, “Just what we’d hoped!”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Humiliate them who celebrate over my distress;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Shout for joy you that are in favor of my vindication;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I’ll declare your goodness and praise all day long.	Ps 35:27-28</span>
