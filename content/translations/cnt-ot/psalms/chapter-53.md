## Psalms Chapter 53

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Fools tell themselves there’s no God. They’re corrupt and commit disgusting sins; none of them does what’s good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> God looks down from heaven to see if anybody understands, if anybody looks to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Every one of them has turned aside and become corrupt; not a one does what’s good, not a one.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 53:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Won’t sinners ever learn? They eat up my people like bread and don’t pray to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They’ll be in a panic like never before, because I’ll scatter the bones of your attackers; you’ll put them to shame because I’ve rejected them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Oh that deliverance would come out of Zion! When I restore the fortunes of my people, Jacob will celebrate, Israel will be happy.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 53:4-6</p>
