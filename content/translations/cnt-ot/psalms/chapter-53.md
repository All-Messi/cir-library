## Psalms Chapter 53

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Fools tell themselves there’s no God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> God looks down from heaven</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Every one of them has turned aside and become corrupt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Won’t sinners ever learn?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They’ll be in a panic like never before,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Oh that deliverance would come out of Zion!</span>
