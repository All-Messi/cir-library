## Psalms Chapter **74**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Why have you thrown us away forever, God? Why does your anger smoke at the sheep in your pasture?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Remember your community that you bought so long ago, that you redeemed as a tribe for your heritage, Mount Zion, where you’ve lived.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Direct your attention to its continuing ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Your adversaries have roared in your sanctuary <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and set up their own standards for signs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>It’s like someone that used an axe in a forest;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>they broke down its carved work with hatchets and hammers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>They burned the sanctuary to the ground and defiled your home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>They said to themselves, <em>“</em><em>We’ll </em><em>completely subdue them”</em>; they set fire to your meeting places in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>We don’t see miraculous signs anymore; there aren’t any prophets; nobody knows how long this will last.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>How long will your adversaries scoff, God, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and mock you? Forever?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Why hold back from doing something? Why keep your right hand against your chest?</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 74:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Yet you’re my king from ancient times, who provided deliverance on the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>You divided the sea by your power and bashed the heads of sea monsters in the water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>You crushed Leviathan’s heads and made it into food for animals in the open country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>You opened springs and torrents, and dried up flowing rivers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Day and night belong to you; you put the sun and stars in place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>You established boundaries for the land and marked out summer and winter.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 74:12-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Remember, LORD, that your enemies are scorning you; foolish people are ridiculing you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Don’t deliver your turtledove to a wild animal; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>don’t forget forever the life of<strong><sup> </sup></strong>your hurting people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Have regard for your covenant because the land is filled with violent places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed; let the poor and needy praise you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Stand up for youirself, God; remember how foolish people scoff at you all day long.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Don’t forget the clamor of your adversaries, the constant uproar of those who rebel against you.</span>
