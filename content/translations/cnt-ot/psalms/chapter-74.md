## Psalms Chapter 74

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Why have you thrown us away forever, God? Why does your anger smoke at the sheep in your pasture?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Remember your community that you bought so long ago, that you redeemed as a tribe for your heritage, Mount Zion, where you’ve lived.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Direct your attention to its continuing ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your adversaries have roared in your sanctuary and set up their own standards for signs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It’s like someone that used an axe in a forest;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> they broke down its carved work with hatchets and hammers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They burned the sanctuary to the ground and defiled your home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They said to themselves, “We’ll completely subdue them”; they set fire to your meeting places in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> We don’t see miraculous signs anymore; there aren’t any prophets; nobody knows how long this will last.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> How long will your adversaries scoff, God, and mock you? Forever?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Why hold back from doing something? Why keep your right hand against your chest?</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 74:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yet you’re my king from ancient times, who provided deliverance on the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You divided the sea by your power and bashed the heads of sea monsters in the water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You crushed Leviathan’s heads and made it into food for animals in the open country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You opened springs and torrents, and dried up flowing rivers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Day and night belong to you; you put the sun and stars in place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You established boundaries for the land and marked out summer and winter.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 74:12-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Remember, LORD, that your enemies are scorning you; foolish people are ridiculing you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Don’t deliver your turtledove to a wild animal; don’t forget forever the life of your hurting people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Have regard for your covenant because the land is filled with violent places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed; let the poor and needy praise you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Stand up for youirself, God; remember how foolish people scoff at you all day long.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Don’t forget the clamor of your adversaries, the constant uproar of those who rebel against you.</span>
