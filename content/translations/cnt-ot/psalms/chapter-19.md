## Psalms Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The heavens show God’s glory; the sky displays his workmanship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Day in and day out they speak; night after night they display intelligence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> There’s no speech or words; there’s nothing to hear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Their testimony goes out to the whole world, their message to the ends of the earth; in them he’s pitched a tent for the sun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It’s like a groom coming out of his room, excited like a man in shape to run a race.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> It rises at one side of the sky and makes its circuit to the other; nothing escapes its warmth.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 19:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The Law of the LORD is perfect for reviving the soul; his Testimony is reliable for making simple people wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing happiness; his commandments are clear, enlightening the mind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Respect for the LORD is pure, lasting forever; his judgments are true and altogether just.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They’re worth more than lots of fine gold; they’re sweeter than honey that drips from the honeycomb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They warn me and reward me when I keep them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Who can see their own mistakes? So declare me innocent of my unseen faults.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Restrain me from presumptuous sins; don’t let them gain control of me. Then I’ll be blameless and relieved for not sinning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> May what I think and say be acceptable to you, LORD, my Rock, my Redeemer.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 19:7-14</p>
