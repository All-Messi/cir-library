## Psalms Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I love you, LORD, my strength,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> my fortress, my deliverer, my God, my Rock, my Refuge; my shield, the place that saves me, my stronghold.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I called on him who deserves praise, and he saved me from my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The waves of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction flooded over me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> the cords of Sheol tied me down; the snares of death had entrapped me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In my desperation, I cried out to the LORD, and he heard me in his Temple.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook because he was angry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Smoke poured out of his nostrils; consuming fire flared from his mouth; glowing coals erupted from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He lowered the sky too and came down with dense darkness under his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He rode on a cherub and came flying swiftly on the wings of the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He covered himself with darkness like a pavilion, with dark rain clouds veiling his advance</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> and hiding the brightness around him, while hailstones and lightning bolts broke through his clouds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD thundered from the sky; the Most High raised his voice; hailstones and lightning bolts resounded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He shot his arrows and scattered my enemies; lightning flashes routed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then the water in the ocean receded; the seabed was exposed at his rebuke, at the blast from his nostrils.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:7-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He reached down from on high and grabbed me and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He delivered me from enemies that hated me, that were too strong for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They attacked me at a time of distress, but the LORD was my buttress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He brought me out to a safe place and rescued me because he delighted in me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The LORD rewarded me for my goodness, for my innocence;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I’d kept his ways and hadn’t sinned by leaving him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> his ordinances all stayed with me; I hadn’t shoved any of his statutes away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I stood blameless in his presence because I’d kept myself from sinning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So the LORD rewarded me for my goodness, for my innocence.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:16-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> To the kind you’re kind; with the blameless you’re blameless;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> with the pure you’re pure; with the treacherous you’re shrewd.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You rescue the humble but bring down the haughty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You’re my lamp, LORD my God, and shine light into my darkness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> With your help, I can crush a whole battalion I can scale any wall.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:25-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> God’s way is perfect; the LORD’s promise proves true; he’s a shield for everyone that depends on his protection.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Who is God except the LORD? Who is a rock but our God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> who wraps me in strength and makes my way safe?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He makes my feet as surefooted a red deer’s hooves and stands me securely on high ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> He trains my hands for battle and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> He’s given me his deliverance as a shield; his help has made me great.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> He’s widened the path where I step so my feet don’t slip.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:30-36</p>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> I chased my enemies and overtook them; I didn’t turn back till I’d eliminated them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again; they fell under my feet</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> because you wrapped me in strength for battle and subdued my assailants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> You’ve made my enemies retreat; I destroyed the ones that hated me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any; they even cried out to the LORD, but he didn’t answer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> I pulverized them like dust in the wind, emptied them out like dirt on the street.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> You delivered me from conflict with the people and placed me at the head of nations; people I didn’t know now serve me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Foreigners submit as soon as they hear me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> they lose heart and come cringing out of their fortresses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> The LORD lives; praise be to my Rock; exalted be God that delivers me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> that avenges me, that subdues nations under me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> that rescues me from my enemies, lifts me above my attackers, and delivers me from violent people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> So I’ll thank you among the nations, LORD, and sing your praises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> You give victory for your king and show enduring love to your anointed one, to me [David] and my descendants forever.</span>
