## Psalms Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I love you, LORD, my strength,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I called on him who deserves praise,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The waves of death entangled me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In my desperation, I cried out to the LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Smoke poured out of his nostrils;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He lowered the sky too</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He rode on a cherub</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He covered himself with darkness like a pavilion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD thundered from the sky;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He shot his arrows and scattered my enemies;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then the water in the ocean receded;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He reached down from on high and grabbed me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He delivered me from enemies</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They attacked me at a time of distress,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He brought me out to a safe place</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The LORD rewarded me for my goodness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I’d kept his ways</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I stood blameless in his presence</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So the LORD rewarded me for my goodness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> To the kind you’re kind;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You rescue the humble</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You’re my lamp, LORD my God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> With your help, I can crush a whole battalion</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> God’s way is perfect;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Who is God except the LORD?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He makes my feet as surefooted a red deer’s hooves</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> He trains my hands for battle</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> He’s given me his deliverance as a shield;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> He’s widened the path where I step</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> I chased my enemies and overtook them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> You’ve made my enemies retreat;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> I pulverized them like dust in the wind,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> You delivered me from conflict with the people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Foreigners submit as soon as they hear me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> The LORD lives; praise be to my Rock;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> So I’ll thank you among the nations, LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> You give victory for your king</span>
