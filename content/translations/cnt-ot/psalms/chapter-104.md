<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bless the LORD, everything that I am! LORD my God, you’re so great; you’re dressed in splendor and majesty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You cover yourself with light as with a robe; you’ve stretched out the sky like a tent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You laid the beams for your rooms on the water; you make the clouds your chariot and walk on the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You make the winds your messengers and blazing fire your ministers.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You built the earth on foundations so it would never shift.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You covered it with the ocean like a robe deeper than the mountains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> At your rebuke it receded; at the sound of your thunder, it withdrew.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The mountains rose up; the valleys sank down to the level you determined for them to have.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You set a boundary the water couldn’t cross so it wouldn’t flow back over the earth again.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:5-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You make springs in the valleys so creeks flow between the mountains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They water the animals in the countryside and quench the thirst of wild donkeys.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Birds live beside them and chirp in the trees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You water the mountains from your home above; your work provides for the earth.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:10-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You make grass grow for the livestock and crops from people’s labor so they could produce food from the ground</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> and wine to cheer them up, so they could make their faces shine with oil and grow food to sustain them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The LORD’s trees drink their fill, Lebanon’s cedars that he planted,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> where birds build their nests and storks make roosts in fir trees.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:14-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> High mountains are for wild goats, and rocks provide cover for badgers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows where to set.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You send darkness, and it becomes night; wild animals prowl around in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When the sun comes up, they go back and lie down in their dens,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> and people go out to work till evening.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:18-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> LORD, how many things you’ve done! you’ve done them all with wisdom and filled the earth with your creations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yonder is the ocean, big and wide; it teems with schools of fish without number, marine life large and small.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Ships move along on it, Leviathan too, which you formed to play in it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:24-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They all depend on you to feed them when it’s time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You give them food, and they gather it; you open your hand and satisfy them with good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> If you hide, they’re scared; you take away their breath, and they die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> You send out your breath, and they’re created; you renew the surface of the ground.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:27-30</p>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Let the LORD’s honor endure forever; let him delight in things he’s made.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The world trembles at his look; the mountains smoke at his touch.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> I’ll sing to the LORD as long as I live; I’ll sing praise to my God as long as I’m here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> May my meditations please him; I’ll be happy in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Let sinners vanish from the earth; let the wicked cease to exist. Bless the LORD, everything that I am! Hallelujah!</span>
