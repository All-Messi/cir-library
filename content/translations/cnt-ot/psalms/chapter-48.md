## Psalms Chapter 48

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD is great and deserves great praise</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Mount Zion, the heights of Zaphon, is high and beautiful—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> In its towers God reveals himself as a strong defense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Kings joined forces</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But as soon as it came into view,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Panic seized them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The LORD destroyed them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> As we’ve heard, so we’ve seen</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In your Temple we think about your enduring love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Like your name, God, your praise is everywhere;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let Mount Zion be happy,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Walk around Zion and count its towers;</span>
