## Psalms Chapter 126

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the LORD brought us exiles back to Zion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Our mouths were laughing,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yes, the LORD has done great things for us;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Restore our fortunes, LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap with joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Those who go back and forth weeping with their bags of seed,</span>
