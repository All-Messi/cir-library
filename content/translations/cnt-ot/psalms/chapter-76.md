<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God is known in Judah; his name is great in Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> His home is in Salem; he lives on Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He has broken flaming arrows there, shields, swords, and weapons of war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You’re glorious, more majestic than mountains full of beasts of prey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Our stouthearted enemies have been stripped of their spoil; they’ve sunk into deep sleep; none of the soldiers could raise a hand against us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob, horse and rider were thrown down into dead sleep.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You’re to be respected; who can withstand you when you’re angry?</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 76:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> People’s wrath only heightens your honor; you dress yourself with the ashes of their anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Make your vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let everyone bring gifts to the One they need to respect.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He breaks the pride of princes; kings on earth respect him.</span>
