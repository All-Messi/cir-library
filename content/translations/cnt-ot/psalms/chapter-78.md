## Psalms Chapter **78**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Listen to my instruction, my people; pay attention to what I’m saying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>I’ll tell a parable and offer hidden truths from our history,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>things we’ve heard and known from our ancestors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>We won’t keep them from our children; we’ll tell the next generation what we praise the LORD for: his strength, the amazing things he’s done.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>He established a Testimony in Jacob and appointed a Law in Israel, one that he commanded our ancestors to teach their children;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>so the coming generation would know— children not yet born— so they’d grow up and tell <u>their</u> children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>to put their confidence in God, not forget what he’s done, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and keep his commands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>They weren’t to be like their ancestors, stubborn and rebellious, who didn’t prepare their heart, whose spirit wasn’t faithful to God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The Ephraimites were archers equipped with bows; yet they retreated in battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>They didn’t keep God’s covenant or follow his Law.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:5-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>They forgot what he’d done, the miracles he’d shown them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>He performed wonders for their ancestors to see in Egypt and in the plain of Zoan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>He divided the sea so they could pass through it and made the water stand in a pile.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He led them with a cloud in the daytime and the light of fire at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>He split rocks open in the desert to give them drinking water in abundance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>He brought streams out of rock and made water run like a river.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Yet they continued to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>In their heart they put him to trial by asking for food they’d like better.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>They spoke against him <em>“Can God prepare a table in the </em><em>desert</em><em>?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>He struck the rock, </em><em>and</em><em> water gushed out</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>and streams </em><em>overflowed.</em> <em>	C</em><em>an he give us bread too?</em> <em>	</em><em>Can he feed us</em><em> mea</em><em>t</em><em>?”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:11-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>When the LORD heard it, he was furious; his wrath burned like fire against Jacob; his anger flared at Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>because they didn’t believe in him or trust in him to deliver them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Yet he commanded the clouds above and opened the doors in the sky,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>and rained down manna on them and gave them bread from the sky to eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>People ate the bread of angels; God sent them food in abundance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>He made the east wind blow and directed the south wind by his power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>When he rained meat on them as plentiful as dust— winged fowl as abundant as sand by the sea—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>he let them fall in the camp around the tents.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:21-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>So they ate their fill of what they craved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Before they’d satisfied their desire, while their food was in their mouths,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>God’s anger swelled up against them; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>he killed their strongest and cut down Israel’s picked men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>In spite of that, they still sinned <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and didn’t believe in his wonderful deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>So he brought their days to an end in futility, their years in terror.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:29-33</p>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>When he started taking their lives, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>they finally repented and turned to  him diligently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>They remembered that he was their rock, that the Most High God <em>was </em>their redeemer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>But they tried to flatter him and lie to him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>because they weren’t being honest with him <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>or faithful to his covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>But in his mercy, he forgave their sin and didn’t destroy them; he often restrained his anger and didn’t express all his wrath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>He remembered that they were mortal, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>wind that blows and doesn’t return.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him there!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Again and again they tested him and pained the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:34-41</p>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>They didn’t keep in mind his power <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>or his rescuing them from their foe</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>as when he performed his signs in Egypt and his miracles in the plain of Zoan:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>he turned their streams to blood so they couldn’t drink from them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>he sent swarms of flies that devoured them and frogs to devour them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>he gave their crops to caterpillars and the product from their labor to locusts;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup>he destroyed their grapevines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>he exposed their cattle to hailstones and their flocks to lightning bolts;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup>he let loose his hot anger on them: fury, indignation, and distress— a band of destroying messengers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>he directed his anger against them, not sparing them from plague and death;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><sup><strong>51</strong></sup>he struck Egypt’s firstborn, the oldest sons in the tents of Ham.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup>Then he led his own people out like sheep and guided them in the desert like a flock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><sup><strong>53</strong></sup>He led them safely so they weren’t afraid, but the sea drowned their enemies.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:42-53</p>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><sup><strong>54</strong></sup>He brought them to his holy land, to this hill country that he’d won.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><sup><strong>55</strong></sup>He drove out the nations in front of them, divided up the land for an inheritance, and enabled the tribes of Israel to live in their tents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v56"><sup><strong>56</strong></sup>Yet they tested him and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t observe his testimonies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup>They were as unreliable as a crooked bow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v58"><sup><strong>58</strong></sup>They provoked him with their high places and aroused his jealousy with their carved images.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:54-58</p>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><sup><strong>59</strong></sup>When God heard it, he was angry and came to abhor Israel.<strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup>So he abandoned his house in Shiloh, the Tabernacle he’d pitched among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v61"><sup><strong>61</strong></sup>He let his powerful <em>Ark </em>be captured and surrendered his honor to the adversary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><sup><strong>62</strong></sup>He allowed the sword to destroy his people<strong>	</strong> and vented his anger on his inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><sup><strong>63</strong></sup>Fire consumed his young men; virgins had no wedding songs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v64"><sup><strong>64</strong></sup>His priests fell by the sword, and widows couldn’t weep.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:59-64</p>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup><strong>65</strong></sup>Then the LORD woke up as from sleeping, like a soldier aroused from drunkenness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><sup><strong>66</strong></sup>He routed his adversaries and put them to eternal shame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v67"><sup><strong>67</strong></sup>He rejected Joseph’s descendants and chose not to keep <em>the tribe of </em>Ephraim,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v68"><sup><strong>68</strong></sup>but chose Judah, Mount Zion that he loved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v69"><sup><strong>69</strong></sup>He built his sanctuary as high as the sky, as enduring as the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><sup><strong>70</strong></sup>He chose David his servant, took him from the sheepfolds,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v71"><sup><strong>71</strong></sup>from tending ewes that had young <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>to shepherding Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v72"><sup><strong>72</strong></sup>He shepherded them with a godly heart and led them with skillful hands.</span>
