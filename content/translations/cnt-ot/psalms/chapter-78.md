## Psalms Chapter 78

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to my instruction, my people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I’ll tell a parable and offer hidden truths from our history,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> We won’t keep them from our children;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He established a Testimony in Jacob</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They weren’t to be like their ancestors,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The Ephraimites were archers equipped with bows;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They didn’t keep God’s covenant</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They forgot what he’d done,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He performed wonders for their ancestors to see</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He divided the sea so they could pass through it</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He led them with a cloud in the daytime</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He split rocks open in the desert</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He brought streams out of rock</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yet they continued to sin against him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> In their heart they put him to trial</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They spoke against him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He struck the rock, and water gushed out</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When the LORD heard it, he was furious;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yet he commanded the clouds above</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> People ate the bread of angels;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He made the east wind blow</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When he rained meat on them as plentiful as dust—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> So they ate their fill of what they craved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Before they’d satisfied their desire,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> God’s anger swelled up against them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> In spite of that, they still sinned</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> So he brought their days to an end in futility,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> When he started taking their lives,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> They remembered that he was their rock,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> But they tried to flatter him and lie to him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> But in his mercy, he forgave their sin</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He remembered that they were mortal,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the desert</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Again and again they tested him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> They didn’t keep in mind his power</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup class="verse-num">52</sup> Then he led his own people out like sheep</span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><sup class="verse-num">53</sup> He led them safely so they weren’t afraid,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><sup class="verse-num">54</sup> He brought them to his holy land,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><sup class="verse-num">55</sup> He drove out the nations in front of them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v56"><sup class="verse-num">56</sup> Yet they tested him and rebelled against the Most High God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup class="verse-num">57</sup> They were as unreliable as a crooked bow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v58"><sup class="verse-num">58</sup> They provoked him with their high places</span>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><sup class="verse-num">59</sup> When God heard it, he was angry</span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><sup class="verse-num">60</sup> So he abandoned his house in Shiloh,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v61"><sup class="verse-num">61</sup> He let his powerful Ark be captured</span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><sup class="verse-num">62</sup> He allowed the sword to destroy his people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><sup class="verse-num">63</sup> Fire consumed his young men;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v64"><sup class="verse-num">64</sup> His priests fell by the sword,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup class="verse-num">65</sup> Then the LORD woke up as from sleeping,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><sup class="verse-num">66</sup> He routed his adversaries</span>

<span class="verse" id="v67"><sup class="verse-num">67</sup> He rejected Joseph’s descendants</span>

<span class="verse" id="v69"><sup class="verse-num">69</sup> He built his sanctuary as high as the sky,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><sup class="verse-num">70</sup> He chose David his servant,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v72"><sup class="verse-num">72</sup> He shepherded them with a godly heart</span>
