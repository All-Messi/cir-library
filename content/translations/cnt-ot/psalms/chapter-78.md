## Psalms Chapter 78

### Maskil of Asaph

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to my instruction, my people; pay attention to what I’m saying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I’ll tell a parable and offer hidden truths from our history,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> things we’ve heard and known from our ancestors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> We won’t keep them from our children; we’ll tell the next generation what we praise the LORD for: his strength, the amazing things he’s done.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He established a Testimony in Jacob and appointed a Law in Israel, one that he commanded our ancestors to teach their children;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> so the coming generation would know— children not yet born— so they’d grow up and tell their children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> to put their confidence in God, not forget what he’s done, and keep his commands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They weren’t to be like their ancestors, stubborn and rebellious, who didn’t prepare their heart, whose spirit wasn’t faithful to God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The Ephraimites were archers equipped with bows; yet they retreated in battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They didn’t keep God’s covenant or follow his Law.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:5-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They forgot what he’d done, the miracles he’d shown them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He performed wonders for their ancestors to see in Egypt and in the plain of Zoan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He divided the sea so they could pass through it and made the water stand in a pile.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He led them with a cloud in the daytime and the light of fire at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He split rocks open in the desert to give them drinking water in abundance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He brought streams out of rock and made water run like a river.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yet they continued to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> In their heart they put him to trial by asking for food they’d like better.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They spoke against him “Can God prepare a table in the desert?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He struck the rock, and water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he give us bread too? Can he feed us meat?”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:11-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When the LORD heard it, he was furious; his wrath burned like fire against Jacob; his anger flared at Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> because they didn’t believe in him or trust in him to deliver them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yet he commanded the clouds above and opened the doors in the sky,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> and rained down manna on them and gave them bread from the sky to eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> People ate the bread of angels; God sent them food in abundance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He made the east wind blow and directed the south wind by his power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When he rained meat on them as plentiful as dust— winged fowl as abundant as sand by the sea—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> he let them fall in the camp around the tents.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:21-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> So they ate their fill of what they craved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Before they’d satisfied their desire, while their food was in their mouths,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> God’s anger swelled up against them; he killed their strongest and cut down Israel’s picked men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> In spite of that, they still sinned and didn’t believe in his wonderful deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> So he brought their days to an end in futility, their years in terror.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:29-33</p>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> When he started taking their lives, they finally repented and turned to  him diligently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> They remembered that he was their rock, that the Most High God was their redeemer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> But they tried to flatter him and lie to him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> because they weren’t being honest with him or faithful to his covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> But in his mercy, he forgave their sin and didn’t destroy them; he often restrained his anger and didn’t express all his wrath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He remembered that they were mortal, wind that blows and doesn’t return.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him there!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Again and again they tested him and pained the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:34-41</p>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> They didn’t keep in mind his power or his rescuing them from their foe</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> as when he performed his signs in Egypt and his miracles in the plain of Zoan:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> he turned their streams to blood so they couldn’t drink from them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> he sent swarms of flies that devoured them and frogs to devour them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> he gave their crops to caterpillars and the product from their labor to locusts;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> he destroyed their grapevines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> he exposed their cattle to hailstones and their flocks to lightning bolts;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> he let loose his hot anger on them: fury, indignation, and distress— a band of destroying messengers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> he directed his anger against them, not sparing them from plague and death;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><sup class="verse-num">51</sup> he struck Egypt’s firstborn, the oldest sons in the tents of Ham.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup class="verse-num">52</sup> Then he led his own people out like sheep and guided them in the desert like a flock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><sup class="verse-num">53</sup> He led them safely so they weren’t afraid, but the sea drowned their enemies.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:42-53</p>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><sup class="verse-num">54</sup> He brought them to his holy land, to this hill country that he’d won.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><sup class="verse-num">55</sup> He drove out the nations in front of them, divided up the land for an inheritance, and enabled the tribes of Israel to live in their tents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v56"><sup class="verse-num">56</sup> Yet they tested him and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t observe his testimonies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup class="verse-num">57</sup> They were as unreliable as a crooked bow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v58"><sup class="verse-num">58</sup> They provoked him with their high places and aroused his jealousy with their carved images.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:54-58</p>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><sup class="verse-num">59</sup> When God heard it, he was angry and came to abhor Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><sup class="verse-num">60</sup> So he abandoned his house in Shiloh, the Tabernacle he’d pitched among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v61"><sup class="verse-num">61</sup> He let his powerful Ark be captured and surrendered his honor to the adversary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><sup class="verse-num">62</sup> He allowed the sword to destroy his people and vented his anger on his inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><sup class="verse-num">63</sup> Fire consumed his young men; virgins had no wedding songs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v64"><sup class="verse-num">64</sup> His priests fell by the sword, and widows couldn’t weep.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 78:59-64</p>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup class="verse-num">65</sup> Then the LORD woke up as from sleeping, like a soldier aroused from drunkenness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><sup class="verse-num">66</sup> He routed his adversaries and put them to eternal shame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v67"><sup class="verse-num">67</sup> He rejected Joseph’s descendants and chose not to keep the tribe of Ephraim,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v68"><sup class="verse-num">68</sup> but chose Judah, Mount Zion that he loved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v69"><sup class="verse-num">69</sup> He built his sanctuary as high as the sky, as enduring as the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><sup class="verse-num">70</sup> He chose David his servant, took him from the sheepfolds,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v71"><sup class="verse-num">71</sup> from tending ewes that had young to shepherding Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v72"><sup class="verse-num">72</sup> He shepherded them with a godly heart and led them with skillful hands.</span>
