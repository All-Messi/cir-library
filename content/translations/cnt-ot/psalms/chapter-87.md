## Psalms Chapter 87

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The city that the LORD founded stands on his holy mountain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> he loves Zion more than the other places in Jacob.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Glorious things are said about you, city of God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I’ll count Rahab [Egypt] and Babylon among those who know me, Philistia, Tyre, and Nubia too: ‘They’ve become citizens there,’” people will say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But they will say about Zion, “This one and that one were born here”; the Most High himself has made it so.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When the LORD registers the nations, he’ll say, “They’ve all become citizens here.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then those who sing and those who play flutes will say, “The springs of all our joy are in you.”</span>
