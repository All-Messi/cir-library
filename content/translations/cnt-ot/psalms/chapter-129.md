## Psalms Chapter 129

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let Israel say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They’ve persecuted me often since I was young,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My back looks like a farmer plowed it</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The LORD is good;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> May everyone that hates Zion</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Let them be like grass on a rooftop</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The reaper doesn’t fill his hand with it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> People that go past don’t say,</span>
