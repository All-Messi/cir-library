## Psalms Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Fools keep telling themselves there’s no God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD looks down from heaven</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But they’ve all veered off course and become corrupted;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Don’t sinners realize what they’re doing</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Terror will overwhelm them later</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Oppressors try to frustrate the endeavors of the oppressed,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Oh that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion!</span>
