## Psalms Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Fools keep telling themselves there’s no God, corrupt people that do corrupt things; none of them does what’s right.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD looks down from heaven to see if there’s anybody that lives wisely, if anybody seeks him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But they’ve all veered off course and become corrupted; not a one of them does what’s right, not a one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Don’t sinners realize what they’re doing when they eat up my people like bread and refuse to call on me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Terror will overwhelm them later because I’m taking the good people’s side.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Oppressors try to frustrate the endeavors of the oppressed, but I’m their refuge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Oh that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores his captive people, Jacob will celebrate; Israel will be happy.</span>
