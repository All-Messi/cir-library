## Psalms Chapter 73

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God is good to Israel, to those whose hearts are pure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I’d almost stumbled; my steps almost slipped;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> because I envied the prosperity of the arrogant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They don’t seem to suffer when they die; their bodies are healthy and well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They don’t have trouble like other people; they aren’t stricken like everyone else.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So pride is the gold chain around their neck; violence is their clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Their eyes are puffy with fatness; they have everything they could want.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They mock, and talk about oppressing, and talk down to the oppressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They brag against the sky itself; their words strut across the world.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 73:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So his people turn to them and drink in all their claims.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They say, “How does God know any of this? Does the Most High even know what’s happening?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They’re the sinful, always at ease as their wealth grows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> It seems like I’ve kept my heart pure for nothing and washed my hands in innocence for no reason,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> because I’m stricken all day and endure grief every morning.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 73:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> If I’d talked the way I felt, I’d have betrayed your people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When I tried to understand why sinners prosper, I was troubled by it</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> till I went to God’s sanctuary; then I understood their destiny.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You put them on slippery places and make them slide into ruin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They’re quickly destroyed, completely swept away by sudden desolation!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They’re like dreamers when they wake up, LORD; their phantoms disappear.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 73:15-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When I was bitter and in turmoil inside,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I was senseless and ignorant like an animal in your presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Nevertheless, I’m continually with you; you’ve taken me by the hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You’ll guide me with your advice and afterward receive me into glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Who do I have in heaven but you? I want you more than anything on earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> My own flesh and heart may grow weak, but you’re my strength and portion forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Those who are far from you perish; you destroy those who are not faithful to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Your nearness to me is good for me; I’ve made you my refuge so I can tell everybody how you operate.</span>
