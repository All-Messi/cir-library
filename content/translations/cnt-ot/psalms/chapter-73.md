## Psalms Chapter 73

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God is good to Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I’d almost stumbled; my steps almost slipped;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They don’t seem to suffer when they die;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They don’t have trouble like other people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So pride is the gold chain around their neck;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Their eyes are puffy with fatness;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They mock, and talk about oppressing,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They brag against the sky itself;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So his people turn to them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They say, “How does God know any of this?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They’re the sinful,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> It seems like I’ve kept my heart pure for nothing</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> If I’d talked the way I felt,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When I tried to understand why sinners prosper,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You put them on slippery places</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They’re quickly destroyed,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They’re like dreamers when they wake up, LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When I was bitter and in turmoil inside,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I was senseless and ignorant</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Nevertheless, I’m continually with you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You’ll guide me with your advice</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Who do I have in heaven but you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> My own flesh and heart may grow weak,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Those who are far from you perish;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Your nearness to me is good for me;</span>
