## Psalms Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to me, LORD; Pay attention to my groaning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Hear my call for help, my God and King, because I pray only to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You hear me in the mornings, when I offer my prayers and wait.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You’re not amused by sinfulness because there’s nothing bad about you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Braggards can’t stand in your presence because you send away everyone that sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You destroy liars and abhor bloodthirsty people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But I’ll go into your house under your enduring love and bow in reverence in your holy Temple.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 5:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Because I have enemies, LORD, lead me in your goodness; make your way clear to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You can’t believe a word they say; they set their heart on destruction; their throat’s an open grave; they flatter with their tongues.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Hold them guilty, God; make their own schemes trip them up! Cast them out because of their many sins because they’re rebelling against you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let everybody be happy that takes refuge in you; let them always sing for joy. Defend them so those who love you can be happy in you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You bless good people and cover them with your favor like a shield.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 5:8-12</p>
