## Psalms Chapter **49**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Hear this, every nation; listen, everyone on earth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>low and high, rich and poor alike.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>My words are wise; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>my thoughts are full of insight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>I listen to proverbs and expound my riddles on a harp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Why should I be afraid when there’s adversity, when my enemies’ sins are all around me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>people who trust in their wealth and brag about how rich they are?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Nobody can <em>use wealth </em>to redeem a brother <em>from death</em> or pay God a ransom for him—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>redeeming a life is too expensive; you may as well forget about</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>living on forever and not seeing the Pit.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 49:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Even the wise die— just like the ignorant and senseless— and leave their wealth to others.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>They act like their houses will last forever, like where they live will be there for all generations; so they name their lands after themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>But in all their pomp, they won’t endure; they’ll perish like animals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>This is the fate of the foolish and those who agree with them:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>like sheep they’re appointed to Sheol; death will be their shepherd. The godly will rule them in the morning; Sheol will consume their form far from their stately homes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>But God will redeem me from its power and take me to himself.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 49:10-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Don’t be afraid when people get rich, when their houses appreciate in value;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>because when they die, they won’t take anything with them; what they gloried in won’t go down with them <em>to the grave</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Though they congratulate themselves while they’re alive, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>though other people praise them for being successful,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>they’ll go to their ancestors and never see the light of day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>People in all their pomp who don’t have intelligence amount to being like animals when they die.</span>
