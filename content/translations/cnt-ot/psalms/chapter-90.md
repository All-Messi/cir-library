## Psalms Chapter 90

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> LORD, through all generations you’ve been our dwelling place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Before the mountains were born or you gave birth to the world, from one end of time to the other, you’ve been God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 90:1-2</p>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You turn people back to dust and say, “Return to dust, mortals.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A thousand years to you are like yesterday, like a watch in the night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You sweep us away like the dreams in our sleep. In the morning we sprout like grass 6and flourish; then toward evening we fade like blossoms and wither away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your anger consumes us; your wrath scares us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You place our iniquities in front of you; our secret sins are open to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> All our days pass away in your fury; we finish our years with a sigh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> We live for 70 years or by good health for 80 years; yet whatever their length, they’re full of labor and pain because they’re gone so soon, and we fly away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Who understands the power of your anger and fury in comparison to the respect you deserve?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So teach us to count our days so we can grow in wisdom toward you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 90:3-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Come back to us, LORD; how long will it be? Have pity on your servants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with your enduring love so we can sing and be happy our whole life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Make us happy for as long as you’ve punished us, for the years we’ve had misfortune.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Let us see your work and our children witness your majesty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Bless us, LORD our God; make our efforts successful; yes, make them succeed!</span>
