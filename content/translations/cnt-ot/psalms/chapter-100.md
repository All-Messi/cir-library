## Psalms Chapter **100**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Make a joyful sound to the LORD, all the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Serve him gladly; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>come to him with singing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Acknowledge that the LORD is God; he made us; we didn’t make ourselves. We’re his people, sheep in his pasture.</span>
