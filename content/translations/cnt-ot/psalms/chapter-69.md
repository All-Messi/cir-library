## Psalms Chapter **69**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Save me, God; I’m in water up to my neck!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>I’ve sunk in deep mud, where there’s no foothold; a flood is sweeping over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>I’m worn out from crying; my throat’s dry; my eyes are red from crying, waiting for my God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The people that hate me for no reason outnumber the hairs on my head; those who want to destroy me are powerful; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>they’re trying to make me repay what I didn’t steal.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>God, you know about my foolish choices; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>I can’t hide the things I’ve done wrong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>May those who put their hope in you <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>not be disgraced because of me; may the ones who look to you not be dishonored by what I’ve done;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>because I’ve endured humiliation for your sake; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>I have<strong><sup> </sup></strong>shame written all over my face.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>I’m alienated from my brothers; my mother’s sons treat me like a foreigner.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>I’m consumed with zeal for your Temple; the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>When I humble myself with fasting, they mock me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>when I wear burlap, they make my name a byword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Those who sit in the city gate talk about me; drunks make up songs about me.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:5-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>But, I pray to you, LORD; at an acceptable time, in your great enduring love, answer me with your sure salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Save me from sinking in the mud; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>deliver me from my enemies and from deep water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>May the flood not overwhelm me or the deep drown me or the Pit close over me.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:13-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Answer me, LORD, because your enduring love is good; turn to me according to your great mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Don’t abandon me, because I’m in distress; answer me quickly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Come close to my soul and redeem it; ransom me from my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>You know my disgrace, shame, and dishonor; all my adversaries stand in your presence.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:16-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Insults have broken my heart; I’m heartsick. I looked for sympathy, but there wasn’t any, and for comforters, but I couldn’t find any.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Instead, they gave me gall to eat and vinegar to drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>May their table become a snare <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and their peace a trap.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>May their eyes go blind and their loins tremble feebly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Pour out indignation on them; overwhelm them with furious anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Make their camp desolate and their tents deserted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>They persecute the one you yourself have struck; they strike even more the ones you’ve <em>already</em> wounded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Pile their sins high; don’t let them experience your goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Erase them from the Book of Life; don’t enroll them with the godly.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:20-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>I’m miserable with pain; save me, God; set me safely up high.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>I’ll praise God with song and magnify him with thanksgiving.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>That will please the LORD more than a young bull with horns and hoofs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>The humble will see it and be happy; you that look to God for help will revive your hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>The LORD listens to the needy; he doesn’t look down on his imprisoned people.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:29-33</p>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>Let earth and sky praise him, the seas and everything that’s in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>God will save Zion and rebuild the towns in Judah <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>so the people can settle there and own it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>The descendants of his servants will inherit it; those who love him will live there.<strong>	</strong></span>
