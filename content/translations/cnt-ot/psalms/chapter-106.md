## Psalms Chapter 106

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hallelujah! Be grateful to the LORD because he’s good; his enduring love lasts forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Who can recount all his mighty deeds? Who can ever praise him enough?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> How blessed they are who maintain justice, who practice goodness all the time!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Remember me, LORD, when you’re gracious to your people; come and rescue me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> so I can share in your holy people’s prosperity, celebrate in your nation’s happiness, and glory in your heritage.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We and our ancestors have sinned, committed iniquity, and behaved badly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Our ancestors in Egypt didn’t get the point of the LORD’s amazing acts or remember his abundant kindness; instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Nevertheless, he saved them to defend his honor and demonstrate his power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He commanded the Red Sea to dry up, and led them through its depths as through a desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He saved them from those who hated them; he rescued them from their enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The water drowned their adversaries; not a one survived.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then they believed in him and praised him in song.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:6-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But they soon forgot what he’d done and didn’t wait for his direction,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> but made loud demands and put him on trial in the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:13-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When men in the camp got jealous of Moses and of Aaron, the LORD’s holy priest,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> the ground opened up and swallowed Dathan and Abiram’s rebels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Fire broke out among their companions and consumed the sinful.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:16-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They made a calf at Horeb/Sinai and worshiped a molten image;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> they exchanged their Glorious One for an image of a bull that eats grass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They forgot God, who’d saved them and done such great things in Egypt,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> amazing things in Ham, awesome things at the Red Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So he said he’d destroy them. If Moses, his chosen one, hadn’t stood in the gap to turn away his wrath, he would’ve done it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They refused to enter the pleasant land and didn’t believe what he promised;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> they grumbled in their tents and didn’t listen to the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> So he swore he’d let them die in the desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> disperse their descendants among the nations, and scatter them in other lands.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:19-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They joined in the worship of Baal-peor and ate sacrifices to the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> What they did provoked him to send a plague out among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then Phinehas got up and intervened; so the plague stopped.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He’s been considered a good man ever since.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:28-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They’d already provoked God at Meribah and got Moses in serious trouble 33for speaking rashly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Later, they failed to eradicate the nations like the LORD told them to,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> but mixed in with them, learned their practices,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> and served their idols, which led to their downfall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> They even sacrificed sons and daughters to the demons</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> and thereby shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters that they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; they polluted the land with blood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> So they defiled themselves with their practices and played the prostitute in their deeds.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:32-39</p>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The LORD’s anger so sparked against his people that he abhorred his special possession.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> So he gave them over to the surrounding nations; people that hated them ruled them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> their enemies subdued them and oppressed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Many times he delivered them, but they kept rebelling with their own intentions and sank into sin.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:40-43</p>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Nevertheless, he felt compassion for them when he heard them cry out in distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He remembered his covenant and relented because of his enduring love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> He even made their captors be kind to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Save us, LORD our God; retrieve us from the nations so we can thank you and glory in praising you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Bless the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Everybody say, “Amen.” Hallelujah!</span>
