## Psalms Chapter 106

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hallelujah!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Who can recount all his mighty deeds?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> How blessed they are who maintain justice,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Remember me, LORD, when you’re gracious to your people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We and our ancestors have sinned,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Our ancestors in Egypt didn’t get the point of the LORD’s amazing acts</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Nevertheless, he saved them to defend his honor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He commanded the Red Sea to dry up,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He saved them from those who hated them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The water drowned their adversaries;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then they believed in him and praised him in song.	Ps 106:6-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But they soon forgot what he’d done</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So he gave them what they asked for,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When men in the camp got jealous of Moses</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Fire broke out among their companions</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They made a calf at Horeb/Sinai</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They forgot God, who’d saved them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So he said he’d destroy them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They refused to enter the pleasant land</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> So he swore he’d let them die in the desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They joined in the worship of Baal-peor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> What they did provoked him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then Phinehas got up and intervened;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He’s been considered a good man ever since.	Ps 106:28-31</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They’d already provoked God at Meribah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Later, they failed to eradicate the nations like the LORD told them to,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> They even sacrificed sons and daughters to the demons</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> So they defiled themselves with their practices</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The LORD’s anger so sparked against his people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> So he gave them over to the surrounding nations;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Many times he delivered them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Nevertheless, he felt compassion for them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He remembered his covenant</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> He even made their captors be kind to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Save us, LORD our God;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Bless the LORD God of Israel</span>
