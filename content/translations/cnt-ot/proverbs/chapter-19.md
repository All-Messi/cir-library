## Proverbs Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The honest poor are better off than dishonest fools.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It’s not good to not know; enthusiasm doesn’t compensate for ignorance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When people’s foolishness brings them to ruin, they blame the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Wealth draws lots of friends that desert you if poverty comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> False witnesses will get their just due; perjurers won’t get off free.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Many ask for generous people’s blessing; everybody makes friends with bighearted people.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Relatives of the poor despise them, and their friends leave! Appealing to them won’t bring them back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> People that gain wisdom care about themselves; they prosper who cherish understanding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> False witnesses won’t go unpunished; liars perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Living in luxury isn’t fitting for a fool, much less for a slave to rule over princes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Discretion gives you control over anger; you learn to delight in overlooking sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A king’s anger is like a lion’s roar; his blessing falls like dew on grass.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A foolish child destroys a father; a nagging wife is like constant dripping.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Houses and wealth people inherit from parents, but a prudent wife comes from the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Laziness lulls people to sleep; shiftless people go hungry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Those who keep the commandments keep their life; people that are careless about their way will lose it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Those gracious to the poor lend to the LORD; he’ll reward them for the good they do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Discipline your children while there’s hope so you won’t ruin their lives.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:13-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Let angry people suffer the consequences; bail them out, and you’ll have it to do again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Listen to advice and respond to discipline so you can gain wisdom for later on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> People make their plans, but the LORD’s counsel is what prevails.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Loyalty makes everyone better; poor people are better <em>at it </em>than liars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Respecting the LORD leads to life; you can sleep in peace without worrying about misfortune.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate, but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:19-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Punish scoffers so the simpleminded can learn prudence; reprove the wise and they’ll be wiser still.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Children that mistreat their parents are an embarrassment and a public disgrace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> If you stop paying attention to discipline, child, you’ll never learn what you need to know.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> A worthless witness makes mockery of justice; a sinful mouth eats sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Penalties are designed for scoffers, and scourging for the backs of fools.</span>
