<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> She's sent her maids</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Abandon your foolish ways and start having a life;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> If you correct a scoffer, you'll be abused;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> So don't bother reproving scoffers; they'll hate you;</span>
