## Proverbs Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge; whoever hates to be corrected stays ignorant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The LORD gives grace to the good, but condemns those who concoct evil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Sinfulness brings instability, but godliness grows deep roots.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A good wife is her husband’s crown, but one that embarrasses him is like cancer in his bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You can trust the thinking of the righteous, but the advice of sinners is treacherous.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The words of sinners are like a murderous ambush, but the words of the godly rescue people.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 12:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The sinful are overthrown and disappear, but the godly stand firm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>People are commended for using good sense; people with perverted minds are despised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The humble who work as servants are better off than those who honor themselves and go hungry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Good people care about their animals’ life; sinful people are cruel to everything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Plow your ground and you’ll have plenty to eat; chasing after fantasies shows poor judgment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Sinners are jealous of each other’s plunder, but the goodly produce <em>their own things</em>.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 12:7-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Their own words trap sinful people; good people avoid trouble like that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Good people gain satisfaction from the effects of their words; their actions also<em> </em>return to reward them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Fools think their way is the right way; but the wise are willing to listen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Fools fly off the handle when insulted, but the prudent stay calm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Honest witnesses tell the truth; false ones just make up something.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Cutting remarks spoken rashly thrust like daggers, but wise words heal wounds.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 12:13-18</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> A truthful tongue lasts a lifetime, but lying lips don’t endure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Deceit lies in hearts that lay plots, but advisors of peace have joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Harm tends not to fall on good people; sinners are always in trouble.</span>
