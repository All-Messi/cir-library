## Proverbs Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When you’re dining with a ruler, be careful with what he sets in front of you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Put a knife to your throat if you have a big appetite.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Don’t crave very many of his delicacies; they may be there to test you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Don’t wear yourself out trying to get wealthy; quit concerning yourself with riches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When you stare at wealth, it disappears; it grows wings like an eagle and flies to the sky.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 23:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Don’t eat with stingy people or crave their delicacies;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>what they think to themselves is what they really are: they may tell you to eat up and drink, but they don’t mean it!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>You’ll vomit the morsel you’ve eaten and waste your compliments.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don’t speak where fools can hear you; they’ll despise the wisdom of what you say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Don’t move an ancient boundary marker or trespass in the fields of the fatherless,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>because their Rescuer is powerful; he’ll sue you in court.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to knowledge.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 23:6-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Don’t withhold discipline from your children; punishment won’t kill them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Use a switch on them and deliver their souls from Sheol.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Son, if your heart’s wise, mine will be glad;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I’ll be happy when you become an honest man.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don’t envy sinners; always live in reverence for the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>There most certainly is a future; your hopes won’t be disappointed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Listen and be wise; direct your heart on the right course.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 23:13-19</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Don’t pal around with heavy drinkers or big eaters;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>drunks and gluttons end up poor, and laziness will dress them in rags.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Listen to your father; don’t look down on your mother when she’s old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Buy truth and don’t sell it; get wisdom, instruction, and insight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Parents delight in well-behaved children; mature offspring make them happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Make father happy; let her enjoy life who gave you birth.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 23:20-25</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Give me your heart, son; observe my ways.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A prostitute is a deep pit; an immoral woman is a narrow well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>She lurks around like a robber and makes men unfaithful.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 23:26-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Who has misfortune? Who is sad? Who has to cope with conflict? Who complains? Who is wounded for no reason? Whose eyes are bloodshot?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Those who linger long over wine, who look around for mixed wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Don’t gaze at wine when it’s red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Afterward it strikes like a serpent; it bites like a viper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You’ll have hallucinations and say crazy stuff.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>You’re like somebody asleep, bobbing on the ocean or swaying on the rigging of a ship.</span>
