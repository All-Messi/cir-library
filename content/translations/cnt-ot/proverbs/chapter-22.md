## Proverbs Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A good name means more than great wealth; being blessed is better than having silver and gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The rich and the poor have this in common: the LORD made them both.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Prudent people see evil and avoid it; but the simpleminded rush on ahead and suffer for it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Wealth, honor, and life are rewards for humility and reverence for the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Briers and snares lie along the path of perverse people; those who watch what they’re doing avoid such things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Train up children in the way they should go; and when they’re older, they won’t stray from it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 22:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The rich rule the poor; borrowers become servants to lenders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Those who sow sin reap disaster, and their fury won’t subdue the opposition.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Generous people will be blessed because they give some of their food to the poor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Get rid of scoffers, and contention leaves too; conflict and dishonor stop.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The one that loves a pure heart and has gracious speech becomes a king’s friend.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The LORD preserves knowledge and overthrows what unreliable people say.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 22:7-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Lazy people claim, <em>“There’s a lion </em><em>outside;</em> <em>I’ll </em><em>surely </em><em>get killed in the streets!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>An immoral woman’s mouth is a deep pit; the one the LORD curses falls into it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a kid, but discipline drives it out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Those who oppress the poor to get ahead— or regale the rich—come to poverty themselves. <strong>Prov 22:13-16</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Listen to the wise and apply your mind to my instruction;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>it will be pleasant if you retain it so you’re ready to pass it on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I’m teaching you today so you’ll trust in the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Haven’t I written helpful things about advice and knowledge,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>to make you sure of the truth so you can report correctly to the one that sent you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Don’t rob the poor, who can’t resist, or <em>try to </em>crush them in court;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>the LORD will argue their case and sentence to death those who’ve robbed them.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 22:17-23</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Don’t associate with people prone to anger or go around with hotheaded types;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>you’ll pick up their habits and entangle yourself in a net.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Don’t give pledges or sign for debts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>If you can’t pay, why let someone take your bed from under you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Don’t remove the ancient boundary markers that your ancestors have set.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Do you see people skilled at their work? They’ll serve kings, not just ordinary people.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 22:24-29</strong></span>
