## Proverbs Chapter **14**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A wise woman builds up her home; a foolish one tears it down with her own hands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>We show respect for the LORD by pursuing godliness; being crooked in our ways means we don’t respect him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>The tongues of fools become a rod for their back; the lips of the wise save them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A manger stays clean where there are no oxen, but abundant crops come in by their strength.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>A truthful witness tells no lies; a false one lies with every breath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Scoffers look for wisdom but don’t find it; knowledge comes easy for insightful people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>There is a way that seems right, but it leads to death.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 14:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Laughter can hide a heavy heart; joy can give way to grief.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Perverse people get a fill of their own ways; good people get satisfaction from theirs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Simpleminded people believe anything, the prudent watch where they step.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The wise take caution and get away from sin, but fools are arrogant and reckless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Short-tempered people do foolish things; people despise people that scheme.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The naïve inherit foolishness, but the prudent wear knowledge like a crown.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Even neighbors dislike the poor, but lots of people like the rich.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Whoever despises another commits sin, but those gracious to the poor find happiness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Won’t they take a loss that devise evil? Those who devise good receive kindness and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>There’s profit in work; mere talk produces poverty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The wise wear their wealth like a crown; the foolish dress in their own foolishness.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Respecting the LORD provides a fountain of life so people can avoid the snares of death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>A growing population speaks well for a king; what’s the point of a prince without subjects?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Wise people control their temper; short-tempered people show their lack of good sense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>30</sup></strong>A peaceful heart makes a healthy body, but jealousy is like cancer of the bone.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>A king favors a servant that acts wisely, but he lashes out at one that disgraces him.<strong>	</strong></span>
