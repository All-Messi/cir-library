<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When good people rule, people are happy; when corrupt leaders take over, the citizens groan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>A son that loves wisdom makes his father happy, but one that visits prostitutes squanders his wealth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A good king creates a stable country, but one that accepts bribes ruins it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Bad people’s sins become their downfall, but the righteous can sing and celebrate.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 29:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The godly care about the rights of the poor; sinful people don’t care about such things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Scoffers can set a city in an uproar, but the wise defuse anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>When the wise argue with the foolish, the foolish get mad or mock; there’s no quiet response.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Bloodthirsty people hate anybody that’s blameless, but the godly are concerned about other people’s lives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Fools lose their temper; the wise keep it in check.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>If a ruler is willing to listen to lies, his advisors become corrupt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The poor and the oppressor have this in common: the LORD makes both of them able to see.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If a king judges the poor fairly, his throne will be permanently secure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Discipline gives children wisdom, but kids that get their way are an embarrassment to their mother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When corrupt leaders get control, sin multiplies; but the godly will see them fall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Correct your children, and they’ll bring you comfort and delight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Where there’s no revelation, people cast off restraint; but those who keep the Law stay happy.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 29:13-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Words alone won’t correct a slave; though he understands, he won’t respond.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>There’s more hope for a fool than for someone that’s rash with words</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>A slave pampered from childhood will turn out to be a rebel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Angry people stir up conflict; hotheads commit a lot of sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Pride brings humiliation; humility lifts up to places of honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Helping a thief puts you in jeopardy: you’ve taken an oath against perjury, but you can’t tell the truth in court.<strong>	</strong></span>
