## Proverbs Chapter **30**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The Words of Agur Son of Jakeh, an Oracle <em>Agur</em> says to Ithiel and Ucal:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Please listen, son, son of my womb, son of my vows;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>don’t waste your strength on the kind of women that destroy kings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Lemuel, it’s not for kings to guzzle wine or for rulers to get addicted to alcohol;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>the fear is that they’ll forget the Law and not give justice to the oppressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Give alcohol to the dying and wine to those in pain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>let them drink and forget their condition, and not remember their suffering anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Speak up for those who can’t speak for themselves;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>judge justly and defend the poor and needy.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 31:1-9</p>

### Tribute to a Worthy Woman


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Who can find a capable wife of noble character? She’s worth more than jewels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Her husband can rely on her, and he’ll not lack anything of value.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>She’ll do him good her whole life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>She looks for wool and linen, and enjoys working with her hands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Like a merchant ship, she brings her food from a distance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>She gets up before daylight to feed her family and assign the day’s jobs to her maids.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>She inspects a field and buys it, and plants a vineyard from her earnings.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 31:10-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>She wraps her waist with strength and makes her arms strong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>She makes sure her efforts are profitable, and her lamp doesn’t go out at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>She reaches for the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>She reaches out to the poor and needy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>She’s not worried when it snows because she has dressed her family in scarlet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>She wears purple and fine linen and makes her own bedclothes.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 31:17-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>The community knows her husband in the city gates, where he sits among the leaders of the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>She makes sashes and linen garments to sell to the merchants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>She dresses in strength and dignity and smiles at the future.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>She speaks wisely and teaches kindly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>She takes care of her household and doesn’t idle away her time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Her children grow up and bless her; her husband, too, and praises her: <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Lots</em><em> of</em><em> </em><em>women</em><em> </em><em>do</em><em> nobly,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>but you excel them all.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Three things are stately in their stride, <em>no</em><em>,</em> four that walk with majestic bearing:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but praise a woman that respects the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Reward her for what she does, and let her work speak for her in the community.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 31:23-31</p>

### Version by Virgil Warren: christir.org


<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>If you’ve been foolish by acting proud or putting other people down, cover your mouth in shame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>As churning cream makes butter and punching a nose makes it bleed, so stirring up anger causes quarrels.</span>
