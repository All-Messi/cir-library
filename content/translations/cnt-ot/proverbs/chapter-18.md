<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Unfriendly people pursue selfish ends; and don’t use common sense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Fools don’t delight in learning, only in telling what they think.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When sinners come, contempt comes with them; and with dishonor comes disgrace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Wise thoughts are deep water; wisdom is the spring for a babbling brook.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Don’t cater to bad people or deprive the good of justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Fools’ lips instigate conflict; their mouths are asking for a slap.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 18:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The mouths of fools bring about their ruin; their lips serve as snares to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Rumors are like delicious morsels; they just work their way down inside you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> People that aren’t productive are relatives of those who destroy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The LORD’s name is a strong tower; escape to it for safety.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; in their imagination it’s like a high wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Pride goes before destruction; humility precedes honor.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 18:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Popping off an answer before listening to the question is foolish and shameful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The human spirit can survive a sick body, but who can endure a broken spirit?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The wise search for knowledge; the prudent acquire it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Generosity opens doors and connects you with important people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The first to argue a case in court sounds convincing till someone cross-examines.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Casting lots ends contentions; it settles disputes between powerful contenders.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 18:13-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Winning back an offended brother is harder than conquering a fortified city; arguments become like the barred gates of a fortress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> What the mouth says satisfies the inner self; what the lips express brings satisfaction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The tongue wields the power of life and death; those who love it will reap its consequences.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> A man that finds a wife finds something good and obtains the LORD’s blessing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The poor ask for help; the rich answer roughly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Someone with lots of “friends” may come to ruin, but there’s a friend that sticks closer than a brother.</span>
