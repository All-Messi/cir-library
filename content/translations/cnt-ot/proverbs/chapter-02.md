## Proverbs Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Son, if you accept what I say and value my commandments,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>if you’re attentive to wisdom and inclined to understanding,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>if you cry out for insight and call out for comprehension,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>if you look for it like silver and search for it like treasure—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> then you’ll understand <em>the importance of </em>reverence for the LORD and find out what it means to know God.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 2:1-5</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD gives wisdom; knowledge and insight come from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He stores up wisdom for godly people and shields those who maintain integrity</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and guard justice. He preserves his saints.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then you’ll understand goodness and justice, equity and every proper course of action.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 2:6-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Discretion will come to you; knowledge will watch over you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to deliver you from the evil way, from people that say perverse things,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>who leave the paths of godliness to walk in the dark,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>who enjoy sinning and revel in its perversity,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>whose paths are crooked, whose ways are treacherous;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>to deliver you from immoral women, from the seductive woman</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>that leaves the husband of her youth and forgets her covenant with God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>whose house lies on the road to death, whose footprints lead to the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>No man that enters her house ever comes back; they don’t reach the paths that lead to life.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 2:11-19</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Follow the road good people take; keep to the paths they follow,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>because the godly will live in the land; the blameless will stay here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But sinners will be removed from the land; the treacherous will be uprooted from their country.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 2:20-22</strong></span>
