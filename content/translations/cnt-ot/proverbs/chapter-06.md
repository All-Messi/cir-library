## Proverbs Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Son, if you sign for your neighbor or give a pledge for a stranger,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>if you get snared by a promise you’ve made or caught by what you’ve said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>do this to deliver yourself: since you’re at his disposal, humble yourself and plead with him <em>to take away your obligation</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Don’t sleep or slumber;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>deliver yourself like a gazelle <em>from</em> <em>a hunter</em>, like a bird from a fowler.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 6:1-5</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Go observe ants, lazy guy; watch what they do and wise up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Though they don’t have a chief, an officer, or ruler,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>they prepare their food in the summer; at harvest time they gather provisions <em>for winter</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> How long will you lie around? When will you get up from napping?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>your poverty will come on you like a bandit; your need <em>will attack you </em>like an armed man.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 6:6-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A worthless, wicked man is one that goes around lying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>that winks with his eye, signals with his feet, gestures with his fingers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>that plots in his mind and constantly stirs up conflict.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Tragedy will come crashing down on him; all at once he’ll be crushed beyond recovery.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 6:11-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Six things the LORD despises; <em>no</em><em>, make that </em>seven that disgust him:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>arrogant eyes, lying tongues, blood-shedding hands,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>plotting hearts, feet in a hurry to do harm,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>witnesses who perjure themselves and people that stir up conflict between friends.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 6:16-19</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Son, keep your father’s commands; don’t leave your mother’s teachings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Bind them next to your heart; hang them around your neck.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They’ll guide you when you walk, watch over you while you sleep, and advise you when you wake up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A commandment is a lamp; teaching is a light; corrections that discipline lead to life.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 6:20-23</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They keep your eyes off an immoral woman, a loose woman with smooth talk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Don’t desire her beauty or let her catch your attention with her eyes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A prostitute leaves a man with little to eat; an immoral woman stalks his very life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Can a man carry fire in his arms and not singe his clothes?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Can he walk on hot coals and not burn his feet?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Can a man go to his neighbor’s wife and not suffer for it?<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 6:24-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> People don’t despise a thief that steals because he’s hungry;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>but when he’s caught, he still needs to repay it seven times over even if he has to sell everything in his house to make it right.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> A man that commits adultery lacks good judgment; he’s looking to destroy himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He’ll find wounds and disgrace and shame he can’t erase.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jealousy makes a husband furious; he won’t restrain his revenge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>35</sup></strong>He won’t accept ransom or be content with your gifts.<strong></span>
