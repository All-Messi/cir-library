## Proverbs Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Take my advice, son;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Keep my commands so you can have a life;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Tie them on your fingers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Call wisdom your sister and insight your friend,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> At the window of my house</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He was going down the street near her corner</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> She's loud and rebellious, not content to stay home—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> She grabs him and kisses him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So I've come out to meet you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I've decorated my couch with covers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Come on, let's drink our fill of love till morning;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My husband's gone on a long trip;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> She entices him with persuasion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Finally he follows her like a bull to slaughter,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> An arrow pierces his liver;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So pay attention to what I'm saying, sons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don't let your heart turn to its own ways</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Her house lies on the road to Sheol,</span>
