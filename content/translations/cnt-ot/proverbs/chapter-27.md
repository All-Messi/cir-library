## Proverbs Chapter **27**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Don’t brag about tomorrow; you don’t know what’s going to happen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Let somebody else praise you, not your own mouth; a stranger, not your own lips.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>A rock is heavy and sand weighs a lot, but a fool’s resentment outweighs either one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Anger and wrath are bad enough, but jealousy is even worse.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Open rebuke is better than secret love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A friend’s wounds may be sincere, but an enemy’s kisses deceive.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 27:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>A person that’s full hates honey; one that’s famished thinks bitter tastes sweet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If you wander away from home, you’re like a bird that wanders off from its nest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Oil and perfume make you feel good, and a friend’s advice is sweet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Don’t abandon a friend, yours or your father’s; that way, if misfortune comes, you won’t have to impose on your brother’s house; a near neighbor is better than a distant brother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Be wise and make me happy, child, so I can answer critics that try to disgrace me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The prudent foresee danger and take precautions; the simpleminded plunge ahead and pay the price.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 27:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Get security from someone that guarantees a foreigner’s debt; get a deposit for a promiscuous woman.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Loudly blessing a friend in the morning will be taken as an enemy’s curse.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>A contentious wife is like a steady rain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>whoever tries to restrain her may as well try to restrain the wind or hold onto something with an oily hand.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 27:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Like iron sharpens iron, one person sharpens another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>If you tend a fig tree, you'll eat its fruit; if you aid your master’s interests, you’ll be rewarded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>As water reflects a face, the heart reflects the real person.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; neither are people’s wants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>A crucible is for silver, and a furnace is for gold; a person is put to the test by flattery.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Though you grind fools in a mortar with a pestle like crushed grain, you won’t separate them from their foolishness.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 27:17-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Keep tabs on the condition of your flocks; pay close attention to your herds,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>because wealth doesn’t last forever, and a crown isn’t permanent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>When the hay’s all in and new growth starts to appear and the grass on the hillsides is in the barn,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>lambs will provide wool for your clothes, and your goats will be worth enough to buy a field;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>you’ll have enough goats’ milk for yourself, your family, and your servant girls.<strong>	</strong></span>
