## Leviticus Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron, his sons, and all Israel, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has commanded </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>that no one in Israel is to slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat inside or outside the camp </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>instead of taking it to the Tent of Meeting to present it to Yahveh. </em>God <em>will hold him guilty of shedding blood. Exclude him from the community. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Instead, people<em> need to take their animals to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and sacrifice them as peace offerings. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The priest will sprinkle the blood on the altar at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and offer up the fat in smoke as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>They’ll no longer sacrifice to the goat-idols they commit prostitution with. That’s a permanent statute. </em><em>	</em><strong>Lev 17:1-7</strong></span>
