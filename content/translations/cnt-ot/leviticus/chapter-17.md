## Leviticus Chapter 17

### Prohibition Against Eating Blood

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron, his sons, and all Israel, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has commanded </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>that no one in Israel is to slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat inside or outside the camp </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>instead of taking it to the Tent of Meeting to present it to Yahveh. </em>God <em>will hold him guilty of shedding blood. Exclude him from the community. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Instead, people<em> need to take their animals to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and sacrifice them as peace offerings. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The priest will sprinkle the blood on the altar at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and offer up the fat in smoke as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>They’ll no longer sacrifice to the goat-idols they commit prostitution with. That’s a permanent statute.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 17:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“Anyone in Israel or a foreigner living there who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>without taking it to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, will be excluded from the community.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“I’ll oppose and exclude from the community anyone in Israel or a foreigner living there who eats blood. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>The life is in the blood, and I’ve given it to you on the altar to atone for you. It’s the lifeblood that atones.” </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I told Israel,<em> “Nobody among you or foreigner among you can eat blood. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>When you hunt an animal or bird that can be eaten, drain out its blood and cover it with dirt.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 17:8-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“In all </em><em>kinds of </em><em>flesh, b</em><em>lood is identified with its life; so I told the Israelites not to eat blood. If any of you eat it, you’ll be excluded </em>from the community<em>. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Whether native or foreign, if you eat an animal that has died or wild animals have torn to pieces, wash your clothes, take a bath, and remain ceremonially unclean till evening. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>If you don’t do that, you’re considered guilty.”</span>
