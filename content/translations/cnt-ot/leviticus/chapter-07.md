## Leviticus Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“This is the law for the </em><em><u>guilt offering</u></em><em>; it’s most holy</em><strong><em>. </em></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>They’re to kill the guilt offering where they kill the burnt offering. </em>The priest <em>will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Then he’ll offer its fat: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>the two kidneys in the loins with the fat that’s on them, and the lobe on the liver. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The priest will offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Any male among the priests can eat it in a holy place. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>The same law applies to the guilt offering and sin offering. The priest that makes atonement with </em><em>it will have it. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The priest that presents anybody’s burnt offering also gets its skin. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Every grain offering that’s baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle is for the priest that presents it. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Every grain offering, dry or mixed with olive oil, will be for any of Aaron’s descendants.   </em><em>	</em><strong>Lev 7:1-10</strong> <strong>Fellowship Offering</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> That’s the law for the burnt offering, grain offering, sin offering, guilt offering, ordination offering, and peace offering. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>It’s what the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai when he told the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong>Lev 7:35-38</strong> <strong>The Ordination of Aaron and His Sons</strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>
