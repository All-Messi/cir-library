## Leviticus Chapter 7

### Guilt Offering

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“This is the law for the </em><em><u>guilt offering</u></em><em>; it’s most holy</em><strong><em>. </em></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>They’re to kill the guilt offering where they kill the burnt offering. </em>The priest <em>will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Then he’ll offer its fat: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>the two kidneys in the loins with the fat that’s on them, and the lobe on the liver. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The priest will offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Any male among the priests can eat it in a holy place. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>The same law applies to the guilt offering and sin offering. The priest that makes atonement with </em><em>it will have it. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The priest that presents anybody’s burnt offering also gets its skin. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Every grain offering that’s baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle is for the priest that presents it. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Every grain offering, dry or mixed with olive oil, will be for any of Aaron’s descendants.</span>

### Fellowship Offering


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>“</em><em>This is the law</em><em> for a </em><em><u>peace offering</u></em><em>. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>If </em><em>you</em><em> offer it as a thanksgiving, then along with it, offer cakes without yeast mixed with olive oil, wafers without yeast anointed with olive oil, and cakes of stirred fine flour mixed with olive oil. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Present your offering with cakes of bread without yeast. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Present one of each offering as a contribution to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. It belongs to the priest that sprinkles the blood from the peace offerings.</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 7:11-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>“Eat the meat from a thanksgiving peace offering the day it’s offered. Don’t leave any of it till morning. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>If it’s an offering for fulfilling a vow or a freewill offering, eat it that day or the next. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Burn any meat that’s left over till the third day. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>If you eat meat from it on the third day, you will not be accepted. It’s an offense that makes you guilty.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 7:15-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>“Don’t eat meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean; burn it. Otherwise, anybody that </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> clean can eat </em>it<em>. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>But an unclean person that eats the meat from a peace offering will be excluded from the community. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Anybody that touches something unclean—human, animal, or something detestable—and then eats the meat from a peace offering, will be excluded from the community.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 7:19-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> <em>“That’s what God has</em><em> consecrated to Aaron and his </em><em>sons from the offerings by fire to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> when he presents them to serve as priests. </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> commanded the Israelites to give them from the day he anointed them. It’s their permanent due.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> That’s the law for the burnt offering, grain offering, sin offering, guilt offering, ordination offering, and peace offering. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>It’s what the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai when he told the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.</span>
