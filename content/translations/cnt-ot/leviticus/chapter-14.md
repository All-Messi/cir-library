## Leviticus Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses, 2"This is the law about lepers that are ceremonially cleansed. Take them to the priest 3outside the camp to see if the leprosy has healed. 4He'll give orders to take two live clean birds, cedar wood, a scarlet string, and hyssop. 5He'll have one bird killed in a clay basin over running water. 6He'll take the live bird, the cedar wood, scarlet string, and hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird killed over running water. 7Then he'll sprinkle seven times the one to be cleansed, pronounce the person ceremonially clean, and let the live bird go free in an open field. 8The ones cleansed will wash their clothes, shave off their hair, take a bath, and be clean. Afterwards they can go into the camp, but they'll stay outside the tent for a week. 9On the seventh day, they'll shave off their hair, beard, and eyebrows; wash their clothes, take a bath, and be ceremonially clean. 10"On the eighth day, the one cleansed will take 2 male lambs without defect, a yearling ewe without defect, .33 bushel .3 ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, and 1 pint 1 log of oil. 11The priest will present them and the person to the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 12The priest will bring 1 male lamb for a guilt offering with the pint 1 log of olive oil and present them as a wave offering. 13He'll slaughter the male lamb where they slaughter the sin offering and burnt offering, because the guilt offering (like the sin offering) is for the priest; it's most holy. 14He's to take some blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed. 15He'll pour some of the pint log of olive oil into his left palm, 16dip his right-hand finger in it, and sprinkle it seven times in front of the LORD. 17Some of the oil still in his palm he'll put on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed—on top of the blood from the guilt offering. 18The rest of the oil in his palm goes on the head of the one to be cleansed. 19Next, he'll offer the sin offering to atone for the person. Last, he'll slaughter the burnt offering 20and offer it up with the grain offering on the altar. Then the person will be ceremonially clean. 21"But someone that's poor can take 1 male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering for atonement, .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a pint log of oil, 22and two turtledoves or young pigeons. One will be a sin offering, the other a burnt offering. 23On the eighth day the person will take them to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 24The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the pint log of olive oil and offer them for a wave offering to the LORD. 25He'll slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and put some of its blood on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed. 26He'll pour some of the olive oil into his left palm 27and with his right-hand finger sprinkle it seven times to the LORD. 28He's to put some of it on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed—on top of the blood from the guilt offering. 29The rest of the oil that's in his palm goes on the head of the one to be cleansed. 30Then he'll offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, 31one for a sin offering, the other for a burnt offering—together with the grain offering. The priest will purify the one to be cleansed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The LORD said further to Moses and Aaron, 34"When you go to Canaan and I put mildew on a house, 35the owner will tell the priest, 'Something like mildew has become visible in my house.' 36The priest will have them empty the house before he goes in to look at the spot so everything in the house won't become unclean. 37He'll go in and look at it. If the mark on the walls has greenish or reddish depressions, and appears deeper than the surface, 38he'll come to the door and quarantine the house for a week. 39On the seventh day, he'll inspect the house again. If the spot has spread on the walls, 40he'll have them tear out the stones with the spot on them and dump them at an unclean place outside the city. 41He'll have them scrape off all the plaster in the house and dump it at an unclean place outside the city. 42Then they'll replace the first stones and re-plaster the house. 43"If the spot shows up again 44and the priest sees it has spread, it's toxic and unclean. 45He'll have them tear the house down—its stones, timbers, and plaster—and dump them outside the city in an unclean place. 46Whoever goes into the house during the quarantine, becomes unclean till evening. 47Likewise, whoever eats or lies down in the house will wash their clothes. 48"But, if the priest inspects the house and the spot hasn't reappeared after being re-plastered, he'll pronounce it ceremonially clean. 49To cleanse the house, he'll take two birds, some cedar wood, a scarlet string, and hyssop, 50and kill one bird in a clay basin over running water. 51He'll take the cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet string, and live bird and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water and sprinkle the house seven times. 52He'll cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and running water, along with the live bird, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet string. 53However, he'll let the live bird loose outside the city in an open field. That way he'll purify the house, and it'll be ceremonially clean." 54That's the law for any skin disease, scabby sores, 55mildew on clothes or a house, 56a swelling, rash, or discolored skin—57to determine when they're ceremonially clean or unclean.</span>
