### Tests for Serious Skin Diseases

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses and Aaron,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“W</em><em>hen </em><em>any of you has</em><em> a swelling, </em><em>rash</em><em>, or </em><em>skin discoloration</em><em> that </em><em>could </em><em>become leprous, </em><em>go</em><em> to Aaron the priest or one of his sons as priests.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>He’ll examine the spot. If the hair in the spot has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin, it’s leprosy. The priest will pronounce you unclean. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But if the discoloration doesn’t appear to go that deep and the hair on it hasn’t turned white, the priest will quarantine you for a week </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>and examine it on the seventh day. If the spot has changed or spread, he’ll quarantine you for another week </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>and examine it again. If the spot has faded and not spread, he’ll pronounce you ceremonially clean; it’s just a rash. Wash your clothes and be clean.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 13:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>“But if the rash spreads, go to the priest again, </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>and he’ll pronounce you unclean. It’s leprosy.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“If you get leprosy, you need to go to the priest </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>to be examined. If there’s a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and there are open sores </em><em>in the swelling, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>it’s chronic leprosy. The priest will pronounce you unclean. He won’t quarantine because you’re </em>definitely<em> unclean. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>If the leprosy spreads from head to toe, </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>he’ll pronounce you clean if it has all turned to normal skin color. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>But if open sores appear, </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>it’s leprosy. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>If the open sores turn to normal skin color again, </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>the priest will pronounce you clean.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 13:7-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“</em><em>When a boil heals </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>and a discoloration or reddish-white swelling comes up in its place, show it to the priest. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>If it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair on it has turned white, he’ll pronounce you unclean. It’s leprosy that has broken out in the boil. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>But if there aren’t any white hairs in it, it’s not deeper than the skin, and it’s faded, you’ll quarantine for a week. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>If it spreads, the priest will pronounce you unclean; it’s an infection. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>But if the discoloration doesn’t spread, it’s just a scar from the boil. You’re clean.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 13:18-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> <em>“If your body gets a burn on the skin and an open sore becomes a bright white or reddish-white spot, </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>the priest needs to examine it. If the hair in the bright spot has turned white and appears to be deeper than the skin, it’s leprosy that broke out of the burn. He’ll pronounce you unclean. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If there’s no white hair in the bright spot and it’s no deeper than the skin, but has faded, you’ll quarantine for a week. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>The priest will examine you on the seventh day. If it spreads on the skin, he’ll declare you unclean; it’s leprosy. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>But if the bright spot doesn’t spread, but has faded, it’s the swelling from the burn. The priest will declare you clean; it’s just a scar from the burn.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 13:24-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“If any of you, man or woman, has an infection on the head—or in the beard, </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>the priest needs to examine it. If it appears to be deeper than the skin and there’s thin yellowish hair in it, he’ll pronounce you unclean. It’s a sore, leprosy of the head or beard. </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>But if it appears to be no deeper than the skin and there’s no black hair in it, quarantine for a week. </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>On the seventh day, the priest will examine it. If the sore hasn’t spread, no yellowish hair has grown in it, and the scale appears to be no deeper than the skin, </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>then shave except for the spot and quarantine</em><em> for another week. </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>On the seventh day, the priest will examine it. If the spot hasn’t spread and doesn’t appear to be deeper than the skin, he’ll pronounce you clean. </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>If the spot spreads after that cleansing, </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>the priest need not look for yellowish hair; you’re </em>definitely<em> unclean. </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>If the priest thinks the spot hasn’t spread and black hairs have grown in it, the sore has healed. He’ll pronounce you ceremonially clean.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> <em>“If any of you, man or woman, has a white bright spot on the skin, </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>the priest needs to examine it. If it’s faint white, it’s eczema breaking out on the skin. You’re ceremonially clean.</span>
