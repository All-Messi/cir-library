## Leviticus Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The LORD told Moses and Aaron to say to Israel, <em>“When a man has a discharge from his body, it’s ceremonially unclean </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>whether it keeps flowing or stops on its own. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Anything he lies on or sits on is </em><em>unclean. </em><strong><sup>5-6</sup></strong><em>If any of you touch his bed or anything he sits on, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Any of you that touch a person with a discharge will do the same and be unclean till evening. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>If someone with a discharge spits on any of you that are clean, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Any saddle a person with a discharge rides on is unclean. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>If any of you touch anything what was under him, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Likewise, if the one with the discharge touches any of you without rinsing his hands, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Break any clay container he touches and rinse any wooden container in water.  </em><em>	</em><strong>Lev 15:1-12</strong><em>	</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That law deals with anyone that has a discharge: a man that has an emission of semen, <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>a woman during her period, a man that lies with an unclean woman.</span>
