## Leviticus Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If you receive a summons to testify about something you've seen or otherwise known and you don't do it, you're considered guilty. 2If you touch anything ceremonially unclean, even unintentionally—swarming things or the carcass of an unclean animal—you're considered defiled. 3If you unintentionally touch such human uncleanness and then realize it, you're considered defiled. 4If you swear rashly to do good or bad and come to realize it, you're considered guilty. 5When you become guilty, report what you've done 6and bring a female lamb or goat as a guilt offering. The priest will atone for you. 7"If you can't afford a lamb, bring two turtledoves or young pigeons. 8The priest will offer one as a sin offering. He'll wring its neck, but not pull it off. 9He'll sprinkle some of its blood on the side of the altar and pour out the rest at the base of the altar—a sin offering. 10He'll prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. The priest will atone for you, and you'll be forgiven. 11"If you can't afford two turtledoves or young pigeons, take .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. Don't put olive oil or incense on it; it's a sin offering. 12Take a handful of it to the priest as God's portion to offer up in smoke on the altar as a sin offering. 13The priest will atone for you in one of those ways and you'll be forgiven. The rest is for the priest—like a grain offering.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD told Moses, 15"If you sin unintentionally against the LORD's holy property, take a guilt offering to the LORD: a ram without defect according to your evaluation in silver shekels of the sanctuary. 16Pay compensation for your sin, add a fifth, and give it to the priests. The priest will atone for you with the ram, and you'll be forgiven. 17"If you sin unintentionally by doing anything the LORD forbids, you're still considered guilty and will take your punishment. 18Take the priest a ram without defect according to your valuation for a guilt offering. The priest will atone for your unintentional sin, and you'll be forgiven. 19It's a guilt offering; the LORD has certainly considered you guilty."</span>
