## Leviticus Chapter 20

### Punishments for Sin

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The LORD told Moses to say to Israel, <em>“</em><em>Stone to death </em><em>people that sacrifice</em><em> </em><em>their </em><em>offspring to Molech.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I’ll </em><em>oppose</em><em> </em><em>the</em><em>m and </em><em>exclude</em><em> </em><em>them from the community; they’ve</em><em> defiled my sanctuary and my holy name.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If you don’t execute them, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I’ll oppose them and their families, and exclude both them and the ones that carried on prostitution with them.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“</em><em>I’ll </em><em>oppose people that turn to mediums or spiritualists and carry on prostitution with them. </em><em>I’ll </em><em>exclude</em><em> </em><em>them </em><em>from </em><em>the community</em><em>.</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><sup>-8</sup></strong><em>So c</em><em>onsecrate</em><em> yourselves and be holy. Practice my statutes because </em><em><u>I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em><u> that sanctifies you</u></em><em>. </em><em>	 </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“Exclude from the community anyone that cusses at father or mother. That’s a crime punishable by death.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 20:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“If a man commits adultery with </em><em><u>another man’s wife</u></em><em>, execute them both. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>A man that lies with his </em><em><u>father’s wife</u></em><em>, has uncovered his father’s nakedness. Execute them both. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>If a man lies with his </em><em><u>daughter-in-law</u></em><em>, execute them both; they’ve committed incest. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>A man that lies with </em><em><u>a male like the ones that lie with a woman</u></em><em>—both of them have committed a disgusting act. Execute them. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>It’s immoral for a man to marry </em><em><u>a woman and her mother</u></em><em>. Burn them both so there won’t be immorality among you. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Execute a man that lies with an </em><em><u>animal</u></em><em> and kill the animal. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Execute any woman that approaches an animal to mate with it; kill the animal. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“It’s a disgrace for a man to take </em><em><u>his sister</u></em><em>—his father’s or mother’s daughter—so he sees her nakedness and she sees his. Exclude them from the </em><em>community. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness. He bears his guilt. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>A man that lies with </em><em><u>a menstruating woman</u></em><em> has laid bare her flow, and she has exposed the flow of her blood. Cut both of them off from the community. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Don’t have sexual relations with </em><em><u>your aunt</u></em><em>; you’ve made naked a blood relative. You’ll be guilty. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>A man that lies with his uncle’s wife has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They’ll bear their sin and die childless. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>A man that takes </em><em><u>his brother’s wife</u></em><em> is repulsive; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. Both will die childless.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 20:17-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <em>“Keep my statutes and ordinances so the land where I’m taking you won’t spew you out. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Don’t follow the customs of nations I drive out ahead of you. It’s because they did those things that they’re repulsive to me. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Take their land; I’ll give it to you, a land flowing with milk and honey. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>So distinguish between ceremonially clean and unclean animals or birds. Don’t make yourselves disgusting by animals, birds, or what crawls on the ground that I’ve separated from you as unclean. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Be holy to me because I, the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, am holy. I’ve set you apart from the nations to be mine. </em></span>
