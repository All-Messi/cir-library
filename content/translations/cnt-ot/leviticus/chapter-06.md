<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD told Moses, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“If</em><em> </em><em>you</em><em> act unfaithfully against the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> and deceive your companion—about a deposit,</em><em> a security entrust</em><em>ed to you, something you stole</em><em> or extorted from </em><em>someone</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>ha</em><em>ve</em><em> found </em><em>t</em><em>hat was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, </em><em>or</em><em> sin </em><em>in </em><em>any</em><em> way like that—</em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>th</em><em>en</em><em> </em><em>you need to return what you stole, what you got by extortion, w</em><em>hat was entrusted to </em><em>you</em><em>, </em><em>what </em><em>lost thing </em><em>you</em><em> found, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>or </em><em>anything you swore about falsely. Add a fifth and</em><em> give it to the one it belongs to </em><em>when you</em><em> present </em><em>your</em><em> guilt offering.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Then </em><em>take</em><em> to the priest </em><em>your</em><em> o</em><em>ffering to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, a ram </em><em>without defect, </em><em>as you evaluate for a guilt offering. </em><strong><em><sup>7</sup></em></strong><em>The priest will atone for you to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, and you’ll be forgiven.”    </em><em>	</em></span>

### Burnt Offering


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron and his sons, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“This is the law for the </em><em><u>burnt offering</u></em><em>. The burnt offering will remain on the hearth on the altar all night till morning. The altar fire will always be burning. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The priest will put on his linen robe and underclothes, </em><em>take</em><em> up the ashes of the burnt offering, and place them beside the altar. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Then he’ll change clothes and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>He’ll burn wood on the altar every morning, lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings. </em><em>[</em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>]</em><strong>   </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 6:8-13</p>

### Guilt Offering 14“This is the law for the grain offering. The descendants of Aaron will present it at the altar. 15One of them will take a handful of the fine flour from the grain offering with its olive oil and incense, and offer it up in smoke on the altar, a pleasing aroma, as God’s portion. 16Aaron and his sons will eat the rest. They’ll eat it as cakes without yeast in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 17It will not be baked with yeast. I’ve given it as their share of my offerings by fire. It’s most holy—like the sin offering and guilt offering. 18Any male descendant of Aaron can eat it. It’s a permanent ordinance among the offerings by fire to the LORD. Whoever touches them becomes holy.”  	Lev 6:14-18


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The LORD told Moses, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to present to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> the day he’s anointed: .11 bushel </em><em><sup>.1</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em> of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half in the morning and half in the evening. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Prepare it with olive oil on a griddle. Take it when it’s well stirred, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>and the anointed priest will offer it. By permanent ordinance it will all be offered up in smoke to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Likewise, completely burn every grain offering. Don’t eat any of it.” </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 6:19-23</p>

### Sin Offering 24-25The LORD told Moses to say to Aaron and his sons, 25“This is the law for the sin offering. Where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering will be slaughtered in front of the LORD. 26The priest that offers it will eat it in a holy place in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 27Anybody that touches it will become consecrated. If any of the blood splashes on a vestment, wash it off in a holy place 28and smash the clay pot it was boiled in. If it was boiled in a bronze container, scour it and rinse it in water. 29Any male priest can eat it; it’s most holy. 30Do not eat a sin offering that has any blood brought to the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; burn it. 	Lev 6:24-30	 Guilt Offering
