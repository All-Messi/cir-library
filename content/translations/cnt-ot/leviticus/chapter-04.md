### Sin Offerings

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The LORD told Moses to tell Israel, <em>“</em><em>If </em><em>an </em><em><u>anointed priest</u></em><em> </em><em>sins </em><em>unintentionally </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>and brings guilt on the p</em><em>eople, he needs</em><em> to offer to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> a bull without defect as a </em><strong><em>sin offering</em></strong><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> is to</em><em> </em><em>take</em><em> </em><em>it</em><em> to the </em><em>entrance to</em><em> the </em><em>Tent of Meeting</em><em>, pu</em><em>t his hand on its head, and slaughter</em><em> it</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The anointed priest will take some of its blood to the Tent of Meeting, </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>dip his finger in it, and sprinkle it seven times in front of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> in front of the sanctuary curtain. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He’ll put some of it on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense, and pour the rest at the base of the altar that’s at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“He’ll remove from </em>the bull<em> the fat of the sin offering: the fat around and on the entrails, </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>the two kidneys in the loins with their fat, and the lobe of the liver, which he’ll remove with the kidneys </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>(</em><em>like it’s removed from the herd animal in the sacrifice for</em><em> peace offerings</em><em>), and the priest will offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>But everything else—the bull’s hide, meat, head, legs, entrails, and refuse—</em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>he’ll take to a ceremonially clean place outside the camp where they pour ashes and burn it on wood.</span>
