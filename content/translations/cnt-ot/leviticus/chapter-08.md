### The Ordination of Aaron and His Sons

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“Take Aaron and his sons, their vestments and anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the 2 rams, and the basket of bread containing no yeast, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>and gather the community at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When they came, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Moses told them, <em>“</em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has commanded this</em><em>.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 8:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and bathed them. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He put the tunic and sash on <em>Aaron</em>, dressed him in the robe, put the ephod on him, and tied it on with the artistic band of the ephod. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He placed the pouch on him and put the Urim and the Thummin in it. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He placed the turban on his head, and on the front of the turban he put the golden plate, the holy crown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and everything in it. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He sprinkled it on the altar seven times and anointed its utensils, the basin, and its stand to consecrate them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He poured some anointing oil on Aaron’s head to consecrate him. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Next, he had Aaron’s sons approach, dressed them with tunics, wrapped them with sashes, and tied caps on them.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 8:6-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He brought the <u>bull</u> for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He slaughtered <em>it</em>, and with his finger put some of its blood on the horns of the altar to purify it. He poured <em>the rest </em>at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to atone for it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He took the two kidneys with the fat on the kidneys, entrails, and lobe of the liver and offered them up in smoke on the altar. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He burned the bull, its hide, meat, and refuse in the fire outside the camp.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 8:14-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then he presented the <u>ram</u> for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He slaughtered it and sprinkled its blood on the altar. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When he’d cut the ram into pieces, he offered up the head, the pieces, and the suet in smoke. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>After he’d washed its entrails and legs, he offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 8:18-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He presented the <u>second ram</u>, the ram of ordination. Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Moses slaughtered <em>it</em> and put some of its blood on Aaron’s right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He had Aaron’s sons approach. He put some of the blood on their right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes. He sprinkled <em>the rest </em>around on the altar. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He took the fat, the fat tail, the fat on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>From the basket of bread without yeast in front of the LORD, he took a cake containing no yeast, a cake of bread mixed with olive oil, and a wafer, and placed them on the portion of fat and on the right thigh. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He put them on the hands of Aaron and his sons, and presented them as a wave offering to the LORD. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering to the LORD by fire for a pleasing aroma. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>He presented the breast as a wave offering. It was Moses’ portion of the ordination ram.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Moses took some anointing oil and blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes to consecrate them and their clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Moses told Aaron and his sons, <em>“Boil the meat at the </em><em>entrance to</em><em> the </em><em>Tent of Meeting</em><em> and </em><em>eat </em><em>it there </em><em>with the bread that’</em><em>s in the basket of the </em><em>ordination offering like I commanded.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>Burn the rest of the meat and bread.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>Don’t go outside the </em><em>Tent of Meeting</em><em> for </em><em>a week</em><em>, </em><em>till you fulfill</em><em> </em><em>your period of ordination; </em><em>he’ll ordain you over the </em><em>seven-day period</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> commanded to do as </em><em>we’ve done today</em><em> to atone for you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Stay at the </em><em>entrance to</em><em> the </em><em>Tent of Meeting</em><em> </em><em>for a week</em><em> and keep the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s </em><em>charge </em><em>so you won’t</em><em> die</em><em>;</em><em> that’s what I’ve commanded.”</em><em> </em></span>
