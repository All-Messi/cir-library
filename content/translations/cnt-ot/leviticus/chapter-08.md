## Leviticus Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses, 2"Take Aaron and his sons, their vestments and anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the 2 rams, and the basket of bread containing no yeast, 3and gather the community at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When they came, 5Moses told them, "The LORD has commanded this."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and bathed them. 7He put the tunic and sash on Aaron, dressed him in the robe, put the ephod on him, and tied it on with the artistic band of the ephod. 8He placed the pouch on him and put the Urim and the Thummin in it. 9He placed the turban on his head, and on the front of the turban he put the golden plate, the holy crown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and everything in it. 11He sprinkled it on the altar seven times and anointed its utensils, the basin, and its stand to consecrate them. 12He poured some anointing oil on Aaron's head to consecrate him. 13Next, he had Aaron's sons approach, dressed them with tunics, wrapped them with sashes, and tied caps on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 15He slaughtered it, and with his finger put some of its blood on the horns of the altar to purify it. He poured the rest at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to atone for it. 16He took the two kidneys with the fat on the kidneys, entrails, and lobe of the liver and offered them up in smoke on the altar. 17He burned the bull, its hide, meat, and refuse in the fire outside the camp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then he presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 19He slaughtered it and sprinkled its blood on the altar. 20When he'd cut the ram into pieces, he offered up the head, the pieces, and the suet in smoke. 21After he'd washed its entrails and legs, he offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He presented the second ram, the ram of ordination. Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 23Moses slaughtered it and put some of its blood on Aaron's right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe. 24He had Aaron's sons approach. He put some of the blood on their right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes. He sprinkled the rest around on the altar. 25He took the fat, the fat tail, the fat on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh. 26From the basket of bread without yeast in front of the LORD, he took a cake containing no yeast, a cake of bread mixed with olive oil, and a wafer, and placed them on the portion of fat and on the right thigh. 27He put them on the hands of Aaron and his sons, and presented them as a wave offering to the LORD. 28Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering to the LORD by fire for a pleasing aroma. 29He presented the breast as a wave offering. It was Moses' portion of the ordination ram.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Moses took some anointing oil and blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes to consecrate them and their clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Moses told Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread that's in the basket of the ordination offering like I commanded. 32Burn the rest of the meat and bread. 33Don't go outside the Tent of Meeting for a week, till you fulfill your period of ordination; he'll ordain you over the seven-day period. 34The LORD commanded to do as we've done today to atone for you. 35Stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for a week and keep the LORD's charge so you won't die; that's what I've commanded."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD commanded by Moses.</span>
