## Leviticus Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders in Israel. 2He told Aaron, "Take a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering—both without defect—and offer them to the LORD. 3Then tell the Israelites,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They took what Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting. The whole community came and stood in front of the LORD. 6Moses said, "The LORD has told you to do that so his glory can appear to you." 7He told Aaron, "Come to the altar and offer your sin offering and burnt offering so you can atone for yourself. Then make the offerings to atone for the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf for the sin offering for himself. 9His sons handed him the blood. He dipped his finger in it, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the rest at the base of the altar. 10Then he offered up in smoke the fat, kidneys, and lobe of the liver; 11but he burned the meat and skin outside the camp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 13They handed him the burnt offering in pieces with the head, and he offered them up in smoke. 14He washed the entrails and legs and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He presented the people's offering. He slaughtered the goat for the sin offering and offered it like the first. 16He also presented the burnt offering as required by the Law. 17Next, he offered up in smoke a handful of the grain offering on the altar—in addition to the morning's burnt offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, peace offerings for the people. Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 19-20On the breasts they placed the fat from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, fat covering, kidneys, and lobe of the liver. He offered them up in smoke. 21But Aaron presented the breasts and right thigh as a wave offering to the LORD—like Moses had commanded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. After he made the sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offerings, he stepped down. 23He and Moses went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to them. 24Fire came out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar. When the people saw it, they cried out and fell on their faces.</span>
