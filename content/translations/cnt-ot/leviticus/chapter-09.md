## Leviticus Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>:</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders in Israel. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He told Aaron, <em>“</em><em>Take a bull calf for a sin offering </em><em>and a ram for a burnt offering—</em><em>bo</em><em>th without defect—</em><em>and offer them </em><em>to</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Then </em><em>tell</em><em> the Israel</em><em>ites</em><em>, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>‘Take</em><em> a male goat for a sin offering, </em> <em>a year-old calf and lamb </em><em>witho</em><em>ut defect for a burnt offering,</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>an</em><em> ox and ram for peace offerings</em><em>, and</em> <em>a grain offering mixed with</em><em> olive</em><em> oil </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>because the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>is going to</em><em> appear to you</em><em> today</em><em>.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They took what Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting. The whole community came and stood in front of the LORD. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Moses said, <em>“T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has </em><em>told</em><em> you to do that </em><em>so his</em><em> glory </em><em>can</em><em> appear to you.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He told Aaron, <em>“Come to the altar and offer your sin offering and burnt offering so you can atone for yourself.</em><em> </em><em>Then m</em><em>ake the offerings to atone for the people</em><em>.”</em><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf for the <u>sin offerin</u><u>g for himself</u>. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>His sons handed him the blood. He dipped his finger in it, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured <em>the rest </em>at the base of the altar. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Then he offered up in smoke the fat, kidneys, and lobe of the liver; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>but he burned the meat and skin outside the camp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He slaughtered the <u>burnt offering</u>. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They handed him the burnt offering in pieces with the head, and he offered <em>them</em> up in smoke. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He washed the entrails and legs and offered <em>them</em> up in smoke with the burnt offering.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 9:8-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He presented the <u>people’s offering</u>. He slaughtered the goat for the sin offering and offered it like the first. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He also presented the burnt offering as required by the Law. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Next, he offered up in smoke a handful of the <u>grain offering</u> on the altar—in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, <u>peace offerings</u> for the people. Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. <strong><sup>19-20</sup></strong>On the breasts they placed the fat from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, fat covering, kidneys, and lobe of the liver. He offered them up in smoke. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>But Aaron presented the breasts and right thigh as a <u>wave offering</u> to the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em>—like Moses had commanded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. After he made the sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offerings, he stepped down. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He and Moses went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to them. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Fire came out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar. When the people saw <em>it, </em>they cried out and fell on their faces.</span>
