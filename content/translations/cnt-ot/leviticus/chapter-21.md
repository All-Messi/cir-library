### Instructions for Priests

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses to tell the sons of Aaron the priests, <em>“None of you are to defile yourselves for a </em>dead<em> person </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>except for a close relative: mother, father, son, daughter, brother—</em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>or virgin sister, since she doesn’t have a husband. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Don’t profane yourselves as a relative by marriage. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Don’t shave your heads, trim your beards, or make cuts on your bodies. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Be holy to your God and not profane him, because you present the offerings by fire to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, the food of your God. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Priests can’t marry a prostitute or divorced woman. They’re holy to God” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“Consecrate them because they offer the food of your God. They’ll be holy to you because I, the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, that sanctifies you am holy. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>If a priest’s daughter profanes herself by prostitution, she profanes her father. Burn her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“A high priest—the one that’s anointed and consecrated to wear the vestments—will not uncover his head or tear his clothes, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>approach any dead person or defile himself even for his father or mother. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>He’s not to leave the sanctuary or profane it, because he has on him God’s consecrating oil. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>He has to marry a virgin from his own people. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>He can’t marry a widow, divorced woman, </em><em>or prostitute; </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>he would profane his offspring among his people. </em><em><u>I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em><u> that sanctifies him</u></em><em>.”</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	    </em><em>eHe  </em></span>
