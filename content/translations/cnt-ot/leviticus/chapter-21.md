## Leviticus Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD told Moses to tell the sons of Aaron the priests, <em>“None of you are to defile yourselves for a </em>dead<em> person </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>except for a close relative: mother, father, son, daughter, brother—</em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>or virgin sister, since she doesn’t have a husband. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Don’t profane yourselves as a relative by marriage. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Don’t shave your heads, trim your beards, or make cuts on your bodies. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Be holy to your God and not profane him, because you present the offerings by fire to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, the food of your God. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Priests can’t marry a prostitute or divorced woman. They’re holy to God” </em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Consecrate them because they offer the food of your God. They’ll be holy to you because I, the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, that sanctifies you am holy. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>If a priest’s daughter profanes herself by prostitution, she profanes her father. Burn her.</em><em>	       </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>

### 10“A high priest—the one that’s anointed and consecrated to wear the vestments—will not uncover his head or tear his clothes, 11approach any dead person or defile himself even for his father or mother. 12He’s not to leave the sanctuary or profane it, because he has on him God’s consecrating oil. 13He has to marry a virgin from his own people. 14He can’t marry a widow, divorced woman, or prostitute; 15he would profane his offspring among his people. I’m the LORD that sanctifies him.”					    eHe    	      	      Lev 21:10-15  16-17The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron, “None of your offspring with a defect can offer the bread of his God: 18a blind or lame man, one with a disfigured face or deformed limb, 19a man with a broken foot or hand, 20a hunchback or dwarf, one with a defect in his eye, one with eczema, scabs, or crushed testicles. 21None of your descendants that has a defect can offer the LORD’s offerings by fire. 22He can eat the bread of his God, holy and most holy, 23but he can’t go in to the curtain or approach the altar. He’s not to profane my sanctuary. I’m the LORD that sanctifies him.”
