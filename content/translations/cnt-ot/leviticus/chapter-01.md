## Leviticus Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD called to Moses from the Tent of Meeting and told him, 2"When you take an offering to the LORD, take it from the herd or flock. 3For a burnt offering from the herd, offer a male without defect. Offer it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 4and put your hand on its head to make it acceptable to atone for you. 5Slaughter the young bull, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, will offer up its blood and sprinkle it around on the altar at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.  6Skin the burnt offering and butcher it. 7The sons of Aaron will put fire on the altar, arrange wood on the fire, 8and arrange the pieces, head, and fat on the wood. 9But you'll wash its entrails and legs, and the priest will offer it up in smoke for a burnt offering, 10"If your burnt offering is a sheep or goat from the flock, it'll be without defect. 11Slaughter it on the north side of the altar in front of the LORD, and the sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 12Then butcher it with its head and fat, and the priests will arrange the pieces on the wood on the altar. 13You'll wash the entrails and legs, and the priest will offer it up in smoke for a burnt offering on the altar, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 14"If it's a burnt offering of birds, bring an offering of a turtledove or young pigeon. 15The priest will take it to the altar, wring it neck, and offer it up in smoke. He'll drain out its blood on the side of the altar, 16take away its crop and feathers, and cast it on the east side of the altar toward the place for the ashes. 17Then he'll tear it by its wings—but not cut it in two—and offer it up in smoke on the altar. It's a burnt offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.</span>
