## Leviticus Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses to say to Israel, "I'm the LORD your God. 3Don't do what they do in Egypt where you lived or in Canaan where I'm taking you. Don't follow their statutes. 4If you obey my regulations and keep my statutes, 5you'll have life. 6"Don't have sexual relations with any blood relative; I'm the LORD. 7Don't uncover the nakedness of your father by uncovering the nakedness of your mother 8or your father's wife. 9Don't have sexual relations with your sister or half-sister, born in your home or elsewhere. 10Don't uncover the nakedness of your granddaughter; her nakedness is your nakedness. [11] 12-14Don't uncover the nakedness of your aunt; she's your parent's blood relative. You uncover your uncle's nakedness by approaching his wife. 15Don't have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law; she's your son's wife. 16Don't have sexual relations with your sister-in-law; it's your brother's nakedness. 17Don't uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter or granddaughter; they're blood relatives. It's sinful. 18Don't marry a woman and her sister and they become rivals. 19"Don't have sexual relations with a woman during her period. 20Don't have sexual relations with your neighbor's wife and be defiled with her. 21Don't offer any of your offspring to Molech or profane your God; I'm the LORD. 22Don't lie with a male as one lies with a female; it's detestable. 23Don't have sexual relations with any animal; you defile yourself. No woman is to stand in front of an animal to mate with it; it's perverse. 24"Don't defile yourselves with such things. The nations I'm chasing out ahead of you defiled themselves that way. 25They've defiled the land; so I've brought punishment on it; it has spewed out its people. 26You are to keep my statutes and judgments; no native or foreigner among you is to do any of those disgusting things. [27] 28That's so the land won't spew you out for defiling it. 29Exclude from the community whoever does any of those disgusting things. 30"You're to keep my charge so you won't defile yourselves. I'm the LORD your God."</span>
