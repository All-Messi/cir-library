## Leviticus Chapter 25

### The Sabbath Year

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The LORD told Moses at Mount Sinai to tell Israel, <em>“When you go into the land I’m giving you, the ground will have a rest to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Plant your fields, prune your vineyards, harvest your crops for six years. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But the seventh year, the ground will rest to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. Don’t plant your fields or prune your vineyards. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Don’t store up volunteer growth or gather grapes from untrimmed vines. Let the ground lie feral for a year. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>You’ll have for food what the ground grows on its own during its sabbath year—yourselves, your male and female slaves, hired hands, and foreigners living with you. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Your livestock and the wild animals on your land will have its produce to eat </em>directly<em>.</span>

### The Year of Jubilee


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“</em><em>Count off 7 weeks of years (49 years). </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Then blow the ram’s horn all over the country on the tenth day, seventh month, the Day of Atonement. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Consecrate the fiftieth year as a nation-wide release for its people, a jubilee. You’ll go back to your own property and family. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Don’t plant, store up volunteer growth, or pick clean the untrimmed vines. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>It’s a Year of Jubilee, set aside for you. Eat its produce directly out of the field.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 25:8-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <em>“In the Year of Jubilee, each of you may go back to your own property. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>If you sell or buy </em>something <em>from one another, </em><em>don’t wrong one another. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Corresponding to the number of years since the last Year of Jubilee, </em><em>you’ll buy </em><em>and sell it based on the number of crops. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Calculate its price by the number of crops you’re buying or selling. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Don’t cheat one another; respect God. </em><em><u>I’m the </u></em><em><u>L</u></em><em><u>ORD</u></em><em><u> your God</u></em><em>.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 25:13-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“In that way, observe my statutes and obey my regulations so you can live securely on the land. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Then the ground will yield its produce so you can eat your fill. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>But if you wonder what you’re going to eat in the seventh year if you don’t plant or harvest crops, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I’ll order my blessing for you in the sixth year so the ground will produce a crop sufficient for three years. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>When you’re planting the eighth year, you’ll still be eating from the old crops till the ninth year’s crop comes in.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 25:18-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> <em>“You can’t sell land permanently because it’s mine. You’re foreigners that live temporarily with me. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>So provide for the redemption of every piece of property. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>If you become so poor you have to sell some of your property, your nearest relative can buy it back. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If you don’t have any relatives but accumulate enough, you have the right to buy it back yourself. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>To reclaim it, calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>If you don’t accumulate enough to buy it back, it remains with the buyer till the Year of Jubilee and then reverts </em>to you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 25:23-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“If you sell a house in a walled city, you have a right to buy it back for a full year. </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>If you don’t buy it back within a year, it passes permanently to the buyer; it doesn’t go back to you in the Year of Jubilee. </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>Houses in villages without walls, however, are like property in the open country; you can buy them back, and they revert to you in the Year of Jubilee. </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>In Levitical towns, Levites have an ongoing right to buy back </em>their<em> houses, </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>and their houses revert to them in the Year of Jubilee. Their houses are their possessions among the Israelites, </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>but they can’t sell pastures attached to their towns; they’re permanent possessions.</em><strong></span>
