## Leviticus Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses to tell the whole community of Israel, "Be holy because I'm holy. 3Respect your parents and keep my Sabbaths. 4Don't turn to idols or make molten gods. I'm the LORD your God. 5"When you offer a peace offering to the LORD, offer it so he'll accept it. 6Eat it the day you offer it and the next day. Burn what's left over till the third day. 7If you eat it on the third day, the LORD won't accept it. 8You'll be guilty of profaning what's holy to him and be excluded from the community. 9"When you harvest, don't harvest the corners of your field or pick up the gleanings of your harvest. 10Don't glean your vineyard or pick up its fallen fruit. Leave it for the needy and foreigners. I'm the LORD your God. 11"Don't steal, lie, or deal falsely with one another. 12Don't swear falsely by me and profane my name. 13"Don't oppress or rob anyone or keep a hired hand's wages overnight. 14Don't curse the deaf or trip the blind. Respect your God. I'm the LORD. 15"Be just when you judge. Don't be partial to the poor or defer to someone with status. Judge fairly. 16Don't slander or act against anyone's life. 17"You can reprove but not sin against or hate a fellow citizen. 18Don't take revenge or bear a grudge. Love your neighbor as yourself. 19"Keep my statutes. Don't crossbreed two kinds of cattle, sow your field with two kinds of seed, or wear a piece of clothes that blends two kinds of material. 20If a man lies carnally with a slave woman that's engaged to another man but not yet redeemed or given her freedom, punish them. Don't put them to death; she wasn't free. 21He'll take a ram to the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 22The priest will atone for him with the ram, and he will be forgiven. 23"When you go into the land and plant fruit trees, consider their fruit forbidden for three years. 24In the fourth year, their fruit will be holy, a praise offering to the LORD. 25The fifth year, you can eat it so it'll increase for you. I'm the LORD your God. 26"Don't eat anything with blood in it or practice fortunetelling or soothsaying. 29"Don't profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, so your country won't fall into prostitution and fill up with lewdness. 33"Don't mistreat foreigners living in your country. 34Treat them like the natives among you. Love them like yourself. You were foreigners in Egypt. I'm the LORD your God. 35"Don't cheat in judgment in measuring weight or volume. 36Have accurate balances, weights, ephahs, and hins. 37Observe my statutes and ordinances. I'm the LORD that brought you out of Egypt."</span>
