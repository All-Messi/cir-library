## Leviticus Chapter 12

### Purification After Childbirth

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-2</sup></strong>The LORD told Moses to tell Israel, <em>“</em><em>When a woman </em><em>has</em><em> a </em><em>boy</em><em>, she’</em><em>s ceremonially </em><em>unclean for </em><em>a week like</em><em> during </em><em>her </em><em>menstruation.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>On the eighth day, circumcise his foreskin. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>For 33 </em>more<em> days, she’ll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth. She’s not to touch anything consecrated or enter the sanctuary until after her purification time. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If she has a girl, she’s ceremonially unclean for two weeks like during menstruation. For 66 </em>more <em>days, she’ll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 12:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“When her purification days are over for a son or daughter, she’ll take to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He’ll offer it to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> for her purification, and she’ll be ceremonially cleansed from her bleeding at childbirth. That’s the law for a woman that has a male or female child. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>If she can’t afford a lamb, she can take two turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a burnt offering, the other for a sin offering. The priest will offer them for her, and she’ll be ceremonially clean.”</span>
