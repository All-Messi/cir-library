### more days, she’ll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth. She’s not to touch anything consecrated or enter the sanctuary until after her purification time. 5If she has a girl, she’s ceremonially unclean for two weeks like during menstruation. For 66 more days, she’ll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth.	 Lev 12:1-5 6“When her purification days are over for a son or daughter, she’ll take to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering. 7He’ll offer it to the LORD for her purification, and she’ll be ceremonially cleansed from her bleeding at childbirth. That’s the law for a woman that has a male or female child. 8If she can’t afford a lamb, she can take two turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a burnt offering, the other for a sin offering. The priest will offer them for her, and she’ll be ceremonially clean.” 	Lev 12:6-8	           Tests for Serious Skin Diseases
