## Leviticus Chapter 10

### The Death of Nadab and Abihu

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s sons, put fire in their firepans. They put incense on it and offered before the LORD fire different from what he’d commanded them. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Fire came out from the LORD and consumed them, and they died. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Moses told Aaron, <em>“</em><em>That</em><em>’</em><em>s what the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> meant when he said</em><em>, </em> <em>‘Those who come near me will treat me as holy</em> <em>in front of the people.’”</em> So Aaron kept quiet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, <em>“</em><em>Carry</em><em> your relatives </em><em>outside</em><em> the camp from </em><em>in</em><em> front of the sanctuary</em>.” <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They carried them outside the camp still in their tunics. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then Moses told Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, <em>“Don’t uncover your heads or tear your clothes so you won’t die and make him angry with the whole community. But your kin, the whole House of Israel, will </em><em>wail over the burning the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> brought about. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Don’t even go out of the Tent of Meeting; you’ll die because the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s anointing oil is on you.”  </em> They did what Moses said.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 10:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The LORD told Aaron,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“D</em><em>on’t drink wine or </em><em>alcohol </em><em>when you </em><em>or your sons </em><em>come into the </em><em>Tent of Meeting so you won’t die—an ongoing </em><em>permanent statute</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That’s</em><em> to distinguish the holy from the prof</em><em>ane, the ceremonially clean from unclean.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>It’s</em><em> to teach the Israel</em><em>ites</em><em> the statutes the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has </em><em>given</em><em> them through Moses.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Moses told Aaron and his surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, <em>“Take the grain offering that’s left over from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> offerings by fire and eat it without yeast</em><em> beside the altar</em><em>; </em><em>it’s most holy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Eat it in a holy place; it’s for you and your sons from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s offerings by fire. That’s what God commanded me. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>The breast and thigh of the wave offering, however, you and your sons and daughters can eat in a clean place; </em>those parts<em> are for you and your offspring. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving, they’ll take with the burnt offerings of the fat portions to present in a wave offering before the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>. It’s for you and your sons permanently.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 10:8-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Moses looked all over for the goat from the sin offering, but it had been burned up. He was mad at Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering at the holy place? It’s most holy, and the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> gave it to you to carry away the guilt of the community, to atone for them. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Since its blood hadn’t been brought into the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary like I commanded.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But Aaron told Moses, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>“This very day they presented their sin offering and burnt offering </em><em>to</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>.</em><em> But this tragedy</em><em> </em><em>has happened to me. I</em><em>f I’d eate</em><em>n a sin offering today, would the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> have </em><em>considered it</em><em> good?</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> That made sense to Moses.</span>
