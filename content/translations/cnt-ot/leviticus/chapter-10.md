## Leviticus Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, put fire in their firepans. They put incense on it and offered before the LORD fire different from what he'd commanded them. 2Fire came out from the LORD and consumed them, and they died. 3Moses told Aaron, "That's what the LORD meant when he said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, "Carry your relatives outside the camp from in front of the sanctuary." 5They carried them outside the camp still in their tunics. 6Then Moses told Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Don't uncover your heads or tear your clothes so you won't die and make him angry with the whole community. But your kin, the whole House of Israel, will wail over the burning the LORD brought about. 7Don't even go out of the Tent of Meeting; you'll die because the LORD's anointing oil is on you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The LORD told Aaron, 9"Don't drink wine or alcohol when you or your sons come into the Tent of Meeting so you won't die—an ongoing permanent statute. 10That's to distinguish the holy from the profane, the ceremonially clean from unclean. 11It's to teach the Israelites the statutes the LORD has given them through Moses."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Moses told Aaron and his surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering that's left over from the LORD's offerings by fire and eat it without yeast beside the altar; it's most holy. 13Eat it in a holy place; it's for you and your sons from the LORD's offerings by fire. That's what God commanded me. 14The breast and thigh of the wave offering, however, you and your sons and daughters can eat in a clean place; those parts are for you and your offspring. 15The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving, they'll take with the burnt offerings of the fat portions to present in a wave offering before the LORD. It's for you and your sons permanently."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Moses looked all over for the goat from the sin offering, but it had been burned up. He was mad at Aaron's surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, 17"Why didn't you eat the sin offering at the holy place? It's most holy, and the LORD gave it to you to carry away the guilt of the community, to atone for them. 18Since its blood hadn't been brought into the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary like I commanded."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But Aaron told Moses, "This very day they presented their sin offering and burnt offering to the LORD. But this tragedy has happened to me. If I'd eaten a sin offering today, would the LORD have considered it good?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> That made sense to Moses.</span>
