## Ruth Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Naomi’s husband Elimelech had a wealthy relative named Boaz. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ruth said to Naomi, <em>“Let me go </em><em>glean among the heads of grain after one that might take an interest in me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Go</em><em> ahead</em><em>, my daughter.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>She went and gleaned behind the harvest crew. She happened to come to the part of the field that belonged to Boaz. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He came from Bethlehem and said to the crew, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> be with you.”</em><em> </em> They said, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> bless you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>He asked the crew chief, <em>“Whose young woman is this?”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>She’</em><em>s the Moabite that came back with Naomi.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>She </em><em>asked to</em><em> glean behind the </em><em>harvest crew</em><em> among the </em><em>bundles</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em> She came and stayed </em><em>since</em><em> morning</em><em>. S</em><em>he’s been sitting in the house for a little while.” </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ruth 2:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Boaz told Ruth, <em>“Listen carefully, my daughter.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t </em><em>glean anywhere else. S</em><em>tay here with my maids.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Watch which</em><em> field </em><em>they harvest and follow them. </em><em>I’ve </em><em>warned the young men</em><em> not to </em><em>bother</em><em> you.</em><em> </em><em>When you’</em><em>re thirsty, go to the water</em><em> jars and drink what the servants </em><em>draw.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>She fell on her face, bowing to the ground, <em>“Why have I </em><em>been pleasing enough to </em><em>you that you</em><em>’ve paid attention to </em><em>me</em><em>? I’m a foreigner.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Boaz said, <em>“</em><em>I’ve heard what you’</em><em>ve done for your mother-in-law after </em><em>her</em><em> husband </em><em>died: </em><em>you left your </em><em>parents</em><em> and the land where you were born and c</em><em>ame to </em><em>people you didn’t know.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>May the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> God of Israel reward your work and pay your wages in full under whose wings you’ve taken refuge. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>She said, <em>“You’ve been gracious to me, my lord. You’ve comforted me and talked nice to me, though I’m not one of your workers.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>At mealtime Boaz told her, <em>“Come and eat some bread and dip your piece in the wine.” </em>She sat beside the harvest crew, and he served her roasted grain. She ate till she was satisfied and had some left over. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When she got up to glean, Boaz told his men, <em>“Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t get after her for it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Pull </em><em>some</em><em> out</em><em> from the bundles and leave it for her</em><em>. D</em><em>on’t fuss at her.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>She gleaned in the field till evening. When she beat out what she’d gleaned, it was</span>

### .1 bushels 1 ephah of barley. 18She picked it up and went into town, and her mother-in-law saw it. She gave Naomi what she had left after she’d had enough. 	Ruth 2:14-18


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Her mother-in-law said, <em>“Where’d you glean today?</em><em> </em><em>Where’d you work?</em><em> </em><em>May he who </em><em>noticed </em><em>you be </em><em>fortunate</em><em>.”</em> <em>“</em><em>I worked with </em><em>a man</em><em> named </em><em>Boaz</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>bless him. He</em><em> hasn’t withdrawn his kindness to the living and the dead.</em><em> He’</em><em>s </em><em>one of our closest relatives</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Ruth said, <em>“Besides, he </em><em>told me to s</em><em>tay close to </em><em>his</em><em> </em><em>workmen</em><em> till they’</em><em>ve finished his</em><em> harvest.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Naomi said <em>“It’s good </em><em>for</em><em> you </em><em>to </em><em>go out with his maids so others won’t </em><em>harm</em><em> you in another field.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>She gleaned close by Boaz’s maids till the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest. She was living with her mother-in-law.<strong>	</strong></span>
