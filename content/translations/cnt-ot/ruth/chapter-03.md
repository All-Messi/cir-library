## Ruth Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then Naomi told her, <em>“L</em><em>e</em><em>t me find a permanent home for you so things</em><em> will </em><em>go</em><em> well </em><em>for</em><em> you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Isn’t Boaz our relative the one whose maids you were with?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Take a bath,</em><em> anoint yourself</em><em>, put on your best clothes, and g</em><em>o down to the threshing floor.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t make yourself known to </em><em>him till he’</em><em>s finished eating.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>N</em><em>otice where he lies</em><em> down</em><em> and </em><em>go</em><em> uncover hi</em><em>s feet and </em><em>lie</em><em> down. He’</em><em>ll tell you what to do.”</em><em> [</em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>]</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>She went down to the threshing floor and did that. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When Boaz had eaten and drunk and was enjoying himself, he went to lie down at the end of the pile of grain. She came secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>In the middle of the night, he was startled and bent forward, and a woman was lying at his feet.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Who </em><em><u>are</u></em><em> you?”</em> <em>“I’m Ruth. Spread your covering over me. You’re a close relative.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> bless you, my daughter</em><em>.</em><em> You’ve shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after younger men, rich or poor. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Don’t worry. I’ll do what you ask, because my people in town know you’re an excellent woman. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>I </em><em><u>am</u></em><em> a close relative, but there’s </em><em>one</em><em> closer. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Stay tonight; in the morning, if he’ll redeem you, all right. If he doesn’t want to, I will, as sure as the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> lives. Lie down till morning.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>She lay at his feet till morning and got up before people could recognize one another. He said, <em>“</em><em>No one must know</em><em> that </em><em>a</em><em> woman came to the threshing floor.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Hold out </em><em>the cloak </em><em>you’re wearing</em><em>.”</em> She held it out, and he laid six measures of barley on her, and she went into town.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When she got to her mother-in-law, she asked her what happened. <em> </em>She told her what he’d done, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“He gave me these six measures of barley and said </em><em>not to</em><em> go to </em><em>my</em><em> mother-in-law empty-handed.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“Wait</em><em> </em><em>till yo</em><em>u find out how the matter goes</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>He</em><em> won’</em><em>t rest till he’</em><em>s settled it today.”</em><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong></span>
