## Ruth Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Boaz went up to the gate and sat down, and the close relative went past. He said, "Come over here, my friend, and have a seat." He went over and sat down. 2He had ten elders of the town sit down there. 3He told the closest relative, "Naomi is back from Moab and has to sell the ground that belonged to our relative Elimelech. 4I thought to inform you to buy it with my people sitting here as witnesses. If you'll redeem it, redeem it. If not, tell me so I'll know. There's nobody but you to redeem it. I'm after you.'" 5"When you buy the field from Naomi, you also need to acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, to maintain title to his inheritance."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The close relative said, "I can't do that. I'd jeopardize my own inheritance. You redeem it. Take my right of redemption."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> This was the former custom in Israel when they redeemed and exchanged land. To confirm the transaction, a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other one. 8The closest relative told Boaz, "Buy it." The other close relative took off his sandal. 9Then Boaz told the elders and the people, "You're witnesses today that I've bought from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon. 10I've acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife to maintain title to his inheritance, so his name won't disappear from his relatives or the court in his birthplace."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The elders and people in court said, "We're witnesses. May the LORD make the woman that's coming to your home like Rachel and Leah, who built the House of Israel. May you gain wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem. 12May your house be like the House of Perez that Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring the LORD gives by this young woman."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Boaz married Ruth, and the LORD enabled her to have a son. 14The women said to Naomi, "Blessed is the LORD who has given you a redeemer today. May he become famous in Israel. 15May he restore your life and sustain you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse. 17The neighbor women said, "Naomi has a son!" They named him Obed, who became father of Jesse father of David.</span>
