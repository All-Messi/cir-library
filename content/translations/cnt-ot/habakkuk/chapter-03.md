## Habakkuk Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Prayer of Habakkuk Set to <em>Shigionoth</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong> LORD, I’ve heard about you and stand in awe. Revive your work in our time and show what you can do; in your anger remember mercy.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Hab 3:1-2</p>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> LORD, I've heard about you and stand in awe. Revive your work in our time and show what you can do; in your anger remember mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> God is coming from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. His brilliance covers the sky; his praise fills the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> His brightness shines like sunshine; lightning bolts flash from his hand where his power lies hidden.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Disease goes ahead of him; plague follows him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He stops and looks the world over; the nations see him and tremble. He beats down the everlasting mountains and levels the ancient hills. His ways of working have existed from eternity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I can see the tents in Nubia in distress; the tent curtains in Midian are shaking <em>in fear</em>.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Hab 3:3-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Did you rage against the rivers? Was your anger against the streams? Was it against the sea that you drove your steeds and victory chariots?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>No. </em>You took the cover off your bow and put your arrows to the string. You washed out canyons in the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The mountains watched you and shook as the torrent flooded past; The roaring deep cried out in surrender and lifted its hands in submission.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The sun and moon stood still; they retreated at the flash of your arrows and the radiance of your spear.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Hab 3:8-1</strong><strong>1</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> In your fury you marched across the world; in your anger you trampled nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You headed out to save your people, to rescue your anointed ones. You crushed the heads of the wicked and laid them open from neck to thigh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You thrust through the leaders of their troops with their own spears. They’d stormed in to scatter us, celebrating as if running over the poor unchecked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>But </em>with your horses you tramped down the sea of soldiers, that surging mighty flood.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Hab 3:12-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I heard <em>it </em>and my body trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. My knees buckled; I froze, unable to move; I’ll wait in silence for distress to descend on our invaders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Though the fir tree hasn’t budded, and there’re no grapes on the vine, and the fields aren’t growing any food, though the flock has scattered from the fold, and there are no cattle in the stalls,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I’ll still rejoice in the LORD and delight in the salvation he’ll bring me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The Lord GOD is my strength; he’s made my feet like deer’s feet and enables me to walk surefooted on high places. (For the choir director accompanied by my stringed instruments)<strong></span>
