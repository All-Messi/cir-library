## Song of Solomon Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Where has your beloved gone,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'm my beloved's, and my beloved's mine,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Turn your eyes away from me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your cheeks are like the halves of a pomegranate</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> There are 60 queens and 80 concubines,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But my dove, my perfect one, is unique;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I went down to the orchard of nut trees</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Before I knew it, my fancy put me</span>
