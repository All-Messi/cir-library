## Song of Solomon Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>“Oh</em><em> that you were my brother,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	who nursed at my mother’s breasts.</em> <em>	</em><em>	If I found you outdoors, I’d kiss you;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and nobody would despise me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>I’d</em><em> take you into my mother’s house,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	who used to instruct me;</em> <em>	</em><em>	I’d give you wine spiced from my pomegranates.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Let</em><em> his left hand be under my head,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and his right hand embrace me.”</em> Groom <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> want you to swear, young women of Jerusalem;</em> <em>	</em><em>	that you won’t wake up my beloved till she’s ready.”</em> Friends <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“Who’s</em><em> that coming up from the countryside,</em> <em>	</em><em>	leaning on her beloved?”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>S of S 8:1-</strong><strong>5a</strong> Groom <em>“Under the apple tree I woke you up;</em> <em>	</em><em>	that’s where your mother was in labor with you,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and gave birth.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Put</em><em> me like a seal over your heart,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	like a seal on your arm.</em> <em>	</em><em>	Love is as strong as death;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	jealousy is as cruel as Sheol;</em> <em>	</em><em>	It flashes fire,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	a very vehement flame.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Flood</em><em> water can’t quench love;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	a river won’t drown it;</em> <em>	</em><em>	If a man would offer all the wealth in his house for love,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	it would be utterly scorned.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>S of S </strong><strong>8:5b-7</strong> Friends <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“We</em><em> have a little sister,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and she doesn’t have breasts;</em> <em>	</em><em>	what will we do for her</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	when she’s spoken for?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> she’s a wall,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	we’ll build a silver battlement on her;</em> <em>	</em><em>	but if she’s a door,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	we’ll barricade her in with cedar boards.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>S of S 8:8-9</strong> Bride <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> was a wall, and my breasts became like towers;</em> <em>	</em><em>	then I was in his eyes like a person that brings peace.</em></span>
