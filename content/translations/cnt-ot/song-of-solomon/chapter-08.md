<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oh that you were my brother,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'd take you into my mother's house,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let his left hand be under my head,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Put me like a seal over your heart,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Flood water can't quench love;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If she's a wall,</span>
