## Song of Solomon Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've come to my garden, my sister, my bride;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I've taken off my dress;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> My beloved extended his hand through the opening,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I got up to open the door for him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I opened for my beloved,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The watchmen that make their rounds in the city met me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I adjure you, young women of Jerusalem,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> His head is like gold—pure gold;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> His eyes are like doves beside streams of water,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> His hands are rods of gold,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> His legs are alabaster pillars</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> His mouth is full of sweetness;</span>
