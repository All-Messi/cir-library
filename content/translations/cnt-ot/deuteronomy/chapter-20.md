### 10“When you approach a city beyond your promised territory, offer it terms of peace. 11If it makes peace, its people will serve you as forced laborers. 12But, if it doesn’t make peace with you, besiege it. 13When the LORD gives it to you, strike the men with the sword. 14Only the women, children, animals, and everything in the city take as spoil and use. 15Do that to all distant towns. 16In towns the LORD’s giving you as an inheritance, don’t leave anything that breathes. 17Destroy the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 18That way they won’t teach you the disgusting things they do for their gods, so you won’t sin against the LORD your God. 19“When you besiege a city, don’t cut down its fruit trees. You can eat from them later. Is a tree a person, that you should besiege it? 20You can only cut down what are not fruit trees to build siege works.
