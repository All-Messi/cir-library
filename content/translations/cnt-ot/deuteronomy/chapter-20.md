### Going to War

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you go to battle and see horses, chariots, and people more numerous than you, don’t be afraid. Yahveh your God, who brought you out of Egypt,</em><em> </em><em>is with you. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> you’re getting ready for battle, the priests will come to remind you,</em><sup> </sup><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>‘Don’t</em><em> be fainthearted, Israel. Don’t panic or tremble. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Yahveh</em><em> is with you to fight for you and save you.’ </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> officers will also say, </em> <em>‘Who has built a house and not dedicated it? He can go home so he won’t die in battle and somebody else dedicate it. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>Who</em><em> has planted a vineyard and not used its fruit? He can go home so he won’t die in battle and somebody else use it. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>Who</em><em> is engaged to a woman and not married her? He can go home so he won’t die in battle and somebody else marry her. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>Who’s</em><em> afraid? He can go home so he won’t make his companions’ hearts melt like his.’ </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>When</em><em> the officers have finished speaking, they’ll appoint commanders to lead the people.</em><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you approach a city beyond your promised territory, offer it terms of peace. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> it makes peace, its people will serve you as forced laborers. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>But</em><em>, if it doesn’t make peace with you, besiege it. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> Yahveh gives it to you, strike the men with the sword. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Only</em><em> the women, children, animals, and everything in the city take as spoil and use. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Do</em><em> that to all distant towns. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> towns Yahveh’s giving you as an inheritance, don’t leave anything that breathes. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Destroy</em><em> the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> way they won’t teach you the disgusting things they do for their gods, so you won’t sin against Yahveh your God.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you besiege a city, don’t cut down </em>its fruit <em>trees. You can eat from them </em>later<em>. Is a tree a person, that you should besiege it? </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Only</em><em> what aren’t fruit trees can you cut down to build siege works.</em><strong></span>
