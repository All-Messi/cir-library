## Deuteronomy Chapter 7

### Driving Out the Nations

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“Yahveh</em><em> will take you to the land and clear out the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites—seven nations bigger and stronger than you. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> deliver them to you, defeat them, and destroy them. Don’t make treaties with them or show them mercy </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>or</em><em> intermarry with them. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> turn your children away from following him to serving other gods. His anger will flare and soon destroy you. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Tear</em><em> down their altars, smash their </em>sacred<em> pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, burn their carved images.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“You’ve</em><em> been set aside to Yahveh your God. Out of all the earth’s nations, he chose you as his own. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> didn’t set his love on you because you were bigger than other nations; you were few compared to them. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>B</em><em>ecause</em><em> he loved you and wanted to keep his oath to your ancestors, he brought you out with power and redeemed you from slavery under Pharaoh. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Know</em><em> then that Yahveh is faithful and keeps covenant and kindness to a thousand generations that love him and obey him. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> he repays directly people that hate him. He won’t delay repaying them with destruction. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Keep</em><em> the commandments, statutes, and case laws I’m commanding you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Deut 7:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“If</em><em> you keep these case laws, he’ll keep you with his covenant and kindness. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> love you, bless you, and multiply you. He’ll bless your offspring and what your ground produces—grain, new wine, olive oil</em>. <em>He’ll increase your herd and the </em><em>young in</em><em> your flock.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> be </em><em>more </em><em>blessed </em><em>than any </em>other <em>nation</em><em>.</em><em> No male or female will be sterile among you or your livestock. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> keep you from getting sick and not put on you any of the diseases you knew in Egypt. He’ll </em><em>lay them on people that hate you. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> consume the nations he delivers to you. Don’t show them any mercy or serve their gods. That would be a snare to you. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“If</em><em> you say to yourselves, ‘These nations are </em><em>bigger</em><em> than we are.</em><em> </em><em>How can we overtake them?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> don’t have to be afraid</em><em> of them.</em><em> </em><em>Remember what </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> did to Pharaoh and </em><em>to</em><em> Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Remember</em><em> the great </em><em>t</em><em>rials you saw, the signs and wonders</em><em>, the strong hand and outstretched arm he delivered you with. That’s what he’ll do to the nations you’re afraid of. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> send hornets after them till they perish who hide from you. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> great, awesome God is among you. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> clear them away little by little. You won’t be able to put an end to them right away. Wild animals would take over. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> deliver them by throwing them into confusion till you destroy them. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> deliver their kings to you to wipe out. Nobody will be able to resist you. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Burn</em><em> the carved images of their gods. Don’t covet the silver or gold that’s on them or take it for yourselves. It would be a snare to you, and it’s detestable to Yahveh. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> bring anything detestable into your house to serve as a devoted thing. Detest it completely; abhor it utterly.</span>
