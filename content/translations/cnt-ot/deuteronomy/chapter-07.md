## Deuteronomy Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will take you to the land and clear out the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites—seven nations bigger and stronger than you. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>He’ll deliver them to you, defeat them, and destroy them. Don’t make treaties with them or show them mercy </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>or intermarry with them. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>They’ll turn your children away from following him to serving other gods. His anger will flare and soon destroy you. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Tear down their altars, smash their </em>sacred<em> pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, burn their carved images.</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“You’ve been set aside to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God. Out of all the earth’s nations, he chose you as his own. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He didn’t set his love on you because you were bigger than other nations; you were few compared to them. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>B</em><em>ecause he loved you and wanted to keep his oath to your ancestors, he brought you out with power and redeemed you from slavery under Pharaoh. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Know then that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is faithful and keeps covenant and kindness to a thousand generations that love him and obey him. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>But he repays directly people that hate him. He won’t delay repaying them with destruction. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Keep the commandments, statutes, and case laws I’m commanding you.    </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Deut 7:1-11</p>

### 12“If you keep these case laws, he’ll keep you with his covenant and kindness. 13He’ll love you, bless you, and multiply you. He’ll bless your offspring and what your ground produces—grain, new wine, olive oil. He’ll increase your herd and the young in your flock. 14You’ll be more blessed than any other nation. No male or female will be sterile among you or your livestock. 15He’ll keep you from getting sick and not put on you any of the diseases you knew in Egypt. He’ll lay them on people that hate you. 16You’ll consume the nations he delivers to you. Don’t show them any mercy or serve their gods. That would be a snare to you.  17“If you say to yourselves, ‘These nations are bigger than we are. How can we overtake them?’ 18You don’t have to be afraid of them. Remember what the LORD did to Pharaoh and to Egypt. 19Remember the great trials you saw, the signs and wonders, the strong hand and outstretched arm he delivered you with. That’s what he’ll do to the nations you’re afraid of. 20He’ll send hornets after them till they perish who hide from you. 21A great, awesome God is among you. 22He’ll clear them away little by little. You won’t be able to put an end to them right away. Wild animals would take over. 23He’ll deliver them by throwing them into confusion till you destroy them. 24He’ll deliver their kings to you to wipe out. Nobody will be able to resist you. 25Burn the carved images of their gods. Don’t covet the silver or gold that’s on them or take it for yourselves. It would be a snare to you, and it’s detestable to the LORD. 26Don’t bring anything detestable into your house to serve as a devoted thing. Detest it completely; abhor it utterly. 	Deut 7:12-26 Call Not to Forget the LORD
