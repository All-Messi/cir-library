## Deuteronomy Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“Israel</em><em>, y</em><em>ou’re crossing the Jordan </em><em>now</em><em> to take over nations bigger and stronger than</em><em> you</em><em>, </em>to take over<em> big cities </em><em>fortified to the sky, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to take over <em>people big and tall, the Anakim you’ve heard people say about, ‘Who can stand up to the descendants of Anak?’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>Don’t</em><em> forget how you’ve provoked Yahveh in the desert. From the time you left Egypt, you’ve been rebellious toward him. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Even</em><em> at Horeb/</em>Sinai<em> you provoked him. He was so angry with you he was ready to destroy you. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I went up on the mountain to receive the stone tablets of his covenant with you, I stayed there 40 days and nights without eating or drinking. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> gave me the tablets he wrote that contained everything he’d told you out of the fire at your assembly. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>At</em><em> the end of the 40 days, he gave them to me, </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>‘Quick</em><em>, go down. Your people have acted corruptly. They’ve turned aside so soon from what I commanded and made themselves a molten image. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> seen how stubborn they are. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Stand</em><em> aside so I can destroy them and erase their name. I’ll make a nation out of you that’s bigger and stronger than they are.’ </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>I</em><em> came down from the burning mountain with the two tablets in my hands. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> saw you’d really sinned against him and made a molten calf. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> threw the tablets down and shattered them in front of you. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>I fell down to Yahveh as at the first for 40 days and nights. I didn’t eat or drink anything because your sin stirred him up. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> was afraid his anger was going to destroy you, but he listened </em><em>to me that time too. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I prayed for him at the same time. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> burned the sinful calf you’d made, pulverized it, ground it up, and threw the dust into the creek that was running down from the mountain.</em><strong>	 </strong><strong>Deut</strong><strong> 9:6-21</strong></span>
