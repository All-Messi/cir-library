## Deuteronomy Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“Do every commandment I’m giving you</em><em> today,</em><em> so you’ll live and multiply, and </em><em>take over</em><em> the land.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Remember the way the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> led you in the </em><em>desert</em><em> th</em><em>o</em><em>se </em><em>40</em><em> years to humble you.</em><em> </em><em>He was testing you to see </em><em>if</em><em> </em><em>you were committed to obeying him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>He let you get hungry</em><em>,</em><em> then fed you with manna</em><em>, </em><em>which you and your ancestors </em><em>had never seen. He mad</em><em>e you understand that a person doesn’t live by </em><em>bread alone</em><em>, but by everything </em>the LORD<em> says.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>All that time y</em><em>our clothes</em><em> didn’t wear out;</em><em> your feet didn’t swell.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> was disciplining you like a </em><em>father</em><em> disciplines his </em><em>children</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>So </em><em>follow</em><em> his commandments and </em><em>respect</em><em> him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He’</em><em>s </em><em>tak</em><em>ing</em><em> you </em><em>to a good land</em><em> with streams and fountains, springs</em><em> flowing in the </em><em>hills and </em><em>valleys</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>It’s <em>a land of wheat and barley; grape</em><em>vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; olive oil and honey; </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>a land where there’s plenty of food, </em><em>whose stones </em><em>contain iron, </em><em>whose hills have copper you can mine.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>When you eat</em><em> </em><em>till you’re full</em><em>, bless the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> for the good land he’s given you.</em></span>

### 11“Make sure you don’t forget him or neglect his commandments, ordinances, and statutes. 12That way you’ll eat till you’re full, build nice houses and live in them, 13have herds and flocks that multiply, and increase your silver and gold along with everything else you have. 14Then you won’t get proud and forget about him. 15He led you through the big, terrible desert, its poisonous snakes and scorpions, its thirsty ground with no water. He brought water out of flint rock. 16He fed you manna to test you and humble you, to do you good in the end. 17Otherwise, you might say to yourselves that your own power and strength have created this wealth. 18Remember that he’s giving you the opportunity to create wealth in confirmation of his covenant. 19If you ever forget him and go after other gods, I’m telling you today, you’ll certainly perish 20like the nations he’ll make perish in front of you.
