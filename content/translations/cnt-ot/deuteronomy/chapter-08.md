## Deuteronomy Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Do every commandment I'm giving you today, so you'll live and multiply, and take over the land. 2Remember the way the LORD led you in the desert those 40 years to humble you. He was testing you to see if you were committed to obeying him. 3He let you get hungry, then fed you with manna, which you and your ancestors had never seen. He made you understand that a person doesn't live by bread alone, but by everything the LORD says. 4All that time your clothes didn't wear out; your feet didn't swell. 5He was disciplining you like a father disciplines his children. 6So follow his commandments and respect him. 7He's taking you to a good land with streams and fountains, springs flowing in the hills and valleys. 8It's a land of wheat and barley; grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates; olive oil and honey; 9a land where there's plenty of food, whose stones contain iron, whose hills have copper you can mine. 10When you eat till you're full, bless the LORD for the good land he's given you. 11"Make sure you don't forget him or neglect his commandments, ordinances, and statutes. 12That way you'll eat till you're full, build nice houses and live in them, 13have herds and flocks that multiply, and increase your silver and gold along with everything else you have. 14Then you won't get proud and forget about him. 15He led you through the big, terrible desert, its poisonous snakes and scorpions, its thirsty ground with no water. He brought water out of flint rock. 16He fed you manna to test you and humble you, to do you good in the end. 17Otherwise, you might say to yourselves that your own power and strength have created this wealth. 18Remember that he's giving you the opportunity to create wealth in confirmation of his covenant. 19If you ever forget him and go after other gods, I'm telling you today, you'll certainly perish 20like the nations he'll make perish in front of you.</span>
