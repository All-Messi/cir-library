## Deuteronomy Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> watch your fellow citizen’s ox or sheep stray off and not take it to its owner. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> the owner doesn’t live close by or you don’t know who the owner is, take it home till the owner comes looking for it and then return it. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Do</em><em> the same thing with someone’s donkey, piece of clothing, or anything a person lost. You can’t confiscate it. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> watch your fellow citizen’s donkey or ox fall down on the road and not help it get it up.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <em>If</em><em> a man takes a wife and goes into her and then turns against her, </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>accuses</em><em> her of shameful acts, publicly defames her, and says, ‘I took this woman, but when I came near her, I found out she wasn’t a virgin,’ </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>then</em><em> her parents will bring the evidence for her virginity to the elders at the city gate. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Her</em><em> father will tell them, ‘I gave her to him as a wife, but he turned against her </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>He accused her Hjjjj</em><em>and</em><em> accused her of not being a virgin. But this is the </em>evidence<em> of her virginity.’ They’ll spread the article of clothing in front of the elders of the city. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> take the man and punish him. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> fine him </em><em>2½ lbs </em><em><sup>100 </sup></em><sup>shekels</sup> of silver <em>and give it to the girl’s father, because </em>the husband<em> publicly def</em><em>amed a virgin of Israel. She’</em><em>ll remain his wife, and he can’t divorce her.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> if the accusation is true, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>they’ll</em><em> take her out to the entrance to her father’s home. The men in her city will stone her to death because she committed a disgraceful act by serving as a prostitute in her father’s family. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you.</em><strong>	    </strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong>Deut 22:12-21</strong></span>
