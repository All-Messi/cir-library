<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong><em>“Don’t watch your fellow citizen’s ox or sheep stray off and not take it to its owner. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>If the owner doesn’t live close by or you don’t know who the owner is, take it home till the owner comes looking for it and then return it. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Do the same thing with someone’s donkey, piece of clothing, or anything a person lost. You can’t confiscate it. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Don’t watch your fellow citizen’s donkey or ox fall down on the road and not help it get it up.</em> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“A woman is</em><em> not </em><em>to </em><em>wear </em><em>a man’s clothes or vice versa.

### ½ lbs 100 shekels of silver and give it to the girl’s father, because the husband publicly defamed a virgin of Israel. She’ll remain his wife, and he can’t divorce her. 20But if the accusation is true, 21they’ll take her out to the entrance to her father’s home. The men in her city will stone her to death because she committed a disgraceful act by serving as a prostitute in her father’s family. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you. 	Deut 22:12-21 22“If a man is caught lying with a married woman, both will die. That’s how you’re to purge evil from Israel. 23“If a virgin is engaged and another man lies with her, 24take them both to the city gate and stone them to death—the girl, because she didn’t scream in the city, and the man because he violated another man’s fiancée. That’s how you’re to purge evil from Israel. 25But if the man finds an engaged girl in a field and rapes her, then only the man will die. 26Don’t do anything to her; there’s no sin in her that deserves death. This case is like a man that murders someone. 27When he found her in the field, she screamed, but there wasn’t anybody there to rescue her.  28“If a man finds a virgin that’s not engaged and has sex with her and they’re discovered, 29the man will give her father 20 oz 50 shekels of silver. She’ll become his wife because he violated her. He can’t divorce her.  30“A man can’t marry his father’s former wife and thereby uncover his father’s cloak.
