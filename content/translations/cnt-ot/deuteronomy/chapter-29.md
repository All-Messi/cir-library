## Deuteronomy Chapter 29

### Renewal of the Covenant

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses to make this covenant with Israel in Moab besides the covenant he made with them at Horeb/<em>Sinai</em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Moses called Israel together and said, <em>	“You’ve seen </em><em>what</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> did in Egypt to Pharaoh, his </em><em>official</em><em>s, and his land.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You saw <em>the great trials, signs, and wonders. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> he still hasn’t given you a heart to know, eyes to see, or ears to hear. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> been leading you for 40 years in the desert. Your clothes and sandals haven’t worn out. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> didn’t eat bread or drink wine or alcohol, but he provided for you so you would know </em><em><u>he’s</u></em><em><u> </u></em><em><u>Yahveh</u></em><em> your God. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When<em> you got here, Sihon and Og came out to meet us, but we defeated them. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> gave their land to Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh</em><em> </em><em>half-tribe</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> keep this covenant so you can prosper in everything you do.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“You’re</em><em> standing today in Yahveh’s presence: your chiefs, tribes, elders, officers, all the men in Israel, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>your</em><em> children and wives, foreigners in your camps from the ones that chop your wood to the ones that draw your water. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>You’re standing here <em>to enter the covenant with Yahveh and into the oath he’s taking with you today </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>to</em><em> establish you as his people and himself as your God—like he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Deut 29:1-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“It’s</em><em> not just with you that he’s making this covenant and </em>taking this<em> oath. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>It’s</em><em> with the ones that aren’t standing here </em>yet<em>. (</em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> know how we lived in Egypt, and how we passed through the nations.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>You’ve seen their </em><em>detestable things</em><em> and their idols </em>made<em> out of wood, stone, silver, and gold</em><em>.</em><em>) </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He’s making this covenant <em>so there won’t be any man or woman, family or tribe, whose heart turns away from him to serve those nations’ gods. </em>He’s doing it<em> so there won’t be among you a </em><em>root that bears bitter, poisonous fruit, </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>or</em><em> </em>anyone that <em>gloats with this curse, ‘I have peace though I’m living in stubbornness to destroy the watered </em>land<em> with the dry.’ </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Yahveh</em><em> will never forgive such people. His anger and jealousy will burn against them. Every curse in this scroll will lie on them, and he’ll erase their names from under the sky. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> single them out for adversity.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Deut 29:14-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <em>“Your</em><em> </em><em>future </em><em>generations</em><em> </em><em>and the foreigners</em><em> </em><em>from distant lands will see the plagues and diseases Yahveh inflicts on this land. They’ll say, </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>‘This</em><em> whole land is sulfur and salt, a burning wasteland, unsown, unproductive, and without vegetation. </em>It’s<em> like Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which he overthrew.’ </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> nations will ask, ‘Why’d Yahveh do that to it? Why’s he so angry?’ </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong>People<em> will answer, ‘Because they forsook his covenant with them and their ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> served other gods he hadn’t given them. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> his anger burned against </em>their<em> land, and he brought on it every curse in this scroll. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> uprooted them and threw them into other lands, like they are now.’ </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“</em><em>The</em><em> secret things belong to Yahveh, but th</em><em>e revealed things be</em><em>long to us and our descendants permanently so we can observe everything in this L</em><em>aw.</span>
