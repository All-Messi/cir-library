## Deuteronomy Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD your God told me to teach you those statutes 2so you and your descendants would respect him and keep them your whole life and live a long time. 3Do them, Israel, so things will go well for you, and you'll multiply in a land flowing with milk and honey. 4"Listen, Israel, the LORD is our God, the LORD only. 5Love him with all your heart, soul, and strength. 6Keep in mind the things I'm commanding you. 7Teach them diligently to your children. Talk about them when you're sitting at home, walking down the road, lying down, or getting up. 8Tie them like signs on your hand and make them like frontlets on your forehead. 9Write them on your gates and doorposts. 10"The land the LORD is taking you to has big, splendid cities you didn't build, 11houses full of good things you didn't put there, hewn cisterns you didn't dig, vineyards and olive trees you didn't plant. When you eat and are satisfied, 12make sure you don't forget him. 13Respect him only. Worship him and swear by him. 14Don't follow the gods of people around you. The LORD is an exclusive God. 15If you follow other gods, his anger will flare at you and wipe you off the earth. 16"Don't test the LORD like you did at Massah. 17Diligently keep his statutes. 18-19Do what he considers right and good so things will go well, so he'll drive out your enemies and you'll take over the good land. 20When your children ask you what his statutes mean, 21tell them, 'We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt, and he brought us out with a tremendous demonstration of power. 22He showed us great terrifying signs and wonders against Egypt, Pharaoh, and his household. 23He brought us out to give us this land. 24He told us to observe these statutes, to always respect him for our own good, for our survival, as is the case today. 25We'll be good if we observe everything he's commanded.'</span>
