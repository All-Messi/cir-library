## Deuteronomy Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the month Abib, celebrate Passover to the LORD your God. That's when he brought you out of Egypt at night. 2Sacrifice the Passover from the flock and the herd where he designates. 3For a week, only eat bread without yeast—the bread of suffering (you came out in a hurry)—so you'll remember all your life when you left Egypt. 4For a week no yeast will be anywhere in any of your houses. None of the meat you sacrifice the first evening is to remain till morning. 5You can't sacrifice the Passover anywhere except where the LORD designates for his name. 6Sacrifice it at sundown, which is when you left Egypt. 7Cook it and eat it where he designates. In the morning go back home. 8For six days, eat bread with no yeast. On the seventh, hold a solemn assembly to the LORD. Don't do any work that day. 9"Count seven weeks from when you start using the sickle on standing grain. 10Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the LORD with a freewill offering. Give in proportion to how he blesses you. 11Celebrate in his presence—you, your son and daughter, male and female servant, the Levite in your town, the foreigner, orphan, and widow among you. 12Remember that you were a slave in Egypt. Observe these statutes carefully. 13"Celebrate the Festival of Booths for a week after you've gathered in the grain from your threshing floor and the wine from your vat. 14Celebrate at the festival—you, your son and daughter, male and female servants, the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow in your towns. 15Celebrate a festival to the LORD for a week where he designates. He'll bless everything you do and what you produce. You'll be altogether joyful. 16"Three times a year, males are to appear in the LORD's presence where he designates: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths. They're not to appear empty-handed. 17Every man will give as he can, in proportion to the LORD's blessing. 18"Appoint judges and officers in your towns by tribes. Judge the people with justice. 19Don't distort justice. Be impartial. Don't take bribes; they blind the wise and pervert the just. 20Pursue justice and justice only, so you can live and possess the land the LORD's giving you. 21"Don't set up a wooden Asherah pole beside an altar you make for the LORD. 22Don't set up sacred pillars. That's something he despises.</span>
