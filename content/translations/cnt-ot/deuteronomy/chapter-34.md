## Deuteronomy Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah across from Jericho. Yahveh showed him the land, Gilead to Dan; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Naphtali, Ephraim and Manasseh; the land of Judah to the Mediterranean Sea; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>the Negev and the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms as far as Zoar. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He told him, <em>“This is the land I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</em><em>, </em><em>‘I’ll give it to your descendants.</em><em>’ </em><em>I’ve let you see it, but </em><em>not enter it</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So Moses died in Moab. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Yahveh</em><em> </em>buried him in an unknown place in a valley in Moab across from Beth-peor. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Although he was 120 when he died, his sight was still clear, and his energy was good. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Israel mourned him for 30 days in the plains of Moab.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Joshua was wise because Moses had laid his hands on him. The Israelites listened to him and did what Yahveh told Moses. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Since then no prophet has risen in Israel that Yahveh related to directly. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>There</em><em> was nobody</em><em> like him </em>for the signs and wonders Yahveh sent him to do in Egypt against Pharaoh, his officials, and his country, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and for the great power and terrifying deeds he performed for Israel to see.</span>
