## Deuteronomy Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You're the people of the LORD your God. Don't cut yourselves or shave your eyebrows for the dead. 2You're set apart to the LORD. Out of all the nations, he's chosen you to be his nation. 3"Don't eat anything detestable. 4You can eat these animals: cattle, sheep, goats, 5deer, gazelles, roebucks, wild goats, ibexes, antelopes, mountain sheep. 6You can eat any animal that has divided hoofs and chews their cud. 7Don't eat camels, rabbits, and rock-badgers. They chew the cud, but don't divide the hoof. They're unclean. 8Don't eat pigs. They divide the hoof, but don't chew cud. They're ceremonially unclean. Don't touch their carcasses. 9"You can eat water animals that have fins and scales. 10If they don't have both, they're ceremonially unclean. 11"You can eat any clean bird. 12You can't eat eagles, vultures, buzzards, 13red kites, falcons, kites of any kind, 14ravens of any kind, 15horned owls, screech owls, sea gulls, hawks of any kind, 16the little owls, great horned owls, white owls, 17pelilcans, carrion vultures, cormorants, 18storks, herons of any kind, hoopoes, or bats. 21"Don't eat anything that dies on its own. You can give or sell it to foreigners in your town to eat. You're a holy people. 22"Make sure to present a tenth of everything you sow in the field each year. 23Eat it in the LORD's presence where he designates—a tenth of your grain, new wine, olive oil, the firstborn in your herd and flock so you'll learn to respect him always. 24If you live too far away to take the tenth itself, 25sell it and take the money where he designates. 26You and your family can spend it on whatever you want—cattle, sheep, wine, alcohol—and eat it in his presence and celebrate. 27Don't neglect the Levites in your town. They don't have a territory to inherit. 28"At the end of the year, deposit a tenth of your produce in your town. 29The Levites (who don't have an inheritance), foreigners, orphans, and widows in your town can come and eat till they're full; the LORD your God will bless you in your work.</span>
