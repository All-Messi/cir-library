## Deuteronomy Chapter **19**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong><em>“When the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> cuts off the nations whose land he’s giving you and you settle in their towns and houses, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>set aside three towns, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>build roads </em>to them<em>, and section the land into three parts so a person that’s killed someone can flee to them.</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“This provision is for someone that kills another accidentally to flee to and live. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>It’s for cases like <em>when a </em>couple friends<em> go to the woods to cut wood. When one of them swings the axe to cut down a tree and the iron head comes off and kills the friend, the slayer can flee to one of these towns. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>That way the avenger of blood can’t pursue in the heat of anger and take the slayer’s life. </em>The slayer <em>doesn’t deserve death because it didn’t happen because of hate. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>So set aside three towns. </em>[<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If the LORD enlarges your territory and gives you the land he promised your ancestors, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and you always love him and follow his ways, then add three more towns<em>.</em>]<em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That way you won’t become guilty of shedding innocent blood.</em><em>	</em><strong> </strong></span>

### 11“But it’s another thing if one person hates another, lies in wait, commits murder, and flees to one of these towns. 12The elders back home are to get the slayer returned for the avenger of blood to execute. 13Don’t show mercy. Purge from Israel the guilt for shedding innocent blood so things will go well for you.  		14“Don’t move a boundary marker that the ancestors have set. Use of Witnesses 15“A single witness can’t accuse somebody of a sin. It takes two or three witnesses to establish a matter. 16If a malicious witness accuses someone, 17both people will stand in the presence of the LORD, that is, in front of the priests and judges in office. 18The judges will investigate thoroughly. If the witness has accused falsely, 19do to him what he’d intended to do to the fellow citizen. That’s how you’re to purge sin from you. 20The rest of the people will show respect and not do such a sinful thing. 21Don’t show mercy: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.	Deut 19:11-21 Going to War
