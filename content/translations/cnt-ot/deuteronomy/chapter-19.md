## Deuteronomy Chapter 19

### Cities of Refuge

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“When</em><em> Yahveh cuts off the nations whose land he’s giving you and you settle in their towns and houses, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>set</em><em> aside three towns, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>build</em><em> roads </em>to them<em>, and section the land into three parts so a person that’s killed someone can flee to them.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>“This</em><em> provision is for someone that kills another accidentally to flee to and live. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>It’s for cases like <em>when a </em>couple friends<em> go to the woods to cut wood. When one of them swings the axe to cut down a tree and the iron head comes off and kills the friend, the slayer can flee to one of these towns. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> way the avenger of blood can’t pursue in the heat of anger and take the slayer’s life. </em>The slayer <em>doesn’t deserve death because it didn’t happen because of hate. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> set aside three towns. </em>[<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If Yahveh enlarges your territory and gives you the land he promised your ancestors, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and you always love him and follow his ways, then add three more towns<em>.</em>]<em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> way you won’t become guilty of shedding innocent blood.</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Deut 19:1-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>“But</em><em> </em>it’s another thing<em> if one person hates another, lies in wait, commits murder, and flees to one of these towns. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> elders back home are to get the slayer returned for the avenger of blood to execute. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> show mercy. Purge from Israel the guilt for shedding innocent blood so things will go well for you. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> move a boundary marker that the ancestors have set.</em> 	<strong>Use of Witnesses</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>“A</em><em> single witness can’t accuse somebody of a sin. It takes two or three witnesses to establish a matter. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> a malicious witness accuses someone, </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>both</em><em> people will stand in the presence of Yahveh, </em>that is, <em>in front of the priests and judges in office. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> judges will investigate thoroughly. If the witness has accused falsely, </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>do</em><em> to him what he’d intended to do to the fellow citizen. That’s how you’re to purge sin from you. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The rest </em>of the people <em>will </em><em>show</em><em> respect and not do such a sinful thing. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> show mercy: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</em><strong></span>
