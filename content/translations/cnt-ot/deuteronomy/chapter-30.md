## Deuteronomy Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When these blessings and curses have come down on you, and you and your descendants remember them where the LORD banishes you, and you change and obey him with all your heart and soul—3then he'll show you mercy and bring you back from captivity in the nations where he's scattered you. 4Even if you're far away, he'll return you 5to your ancestors' land to possess it again. He'll prosper you and multiply you more than your forebears. 6He'll circumcise your and your descendants' hearts so you'll love him heart and soul, and have life. 7The LORD will inflict these curses on people that hate you and persecute you. 8You'll obey him again in everything I'm telling you now. 9Then he'll prosper you in what you do, in the offspring from your body and your livestock, and in the produce from your ground. He'll delight in you again like he did in your ancestors. [10] 11"This commandment's not too hard for you. It's not out of reach 12in the sky, that would make you say, 'Who'll go up to get it for us so we can hear it and do it?' 13It's not beyond the ocean that would make you say, 'Who'll go get it for us so we can hear it and do it?' 14It's right beside you, in your mouth and heart, so you can do it. 15"Look, today I'm setting life and prosperity in front of you, death and adversity. 16It's prosperity if you love the LORD, follow his ways, and keep his commandments so you can live and multiply, and he can bless you in the land. 17It's adversity if your heart turns away and you go serve other gods.  18You'll completely perish. You won't live long in the land you're crossing the Jordan to possess. 19I call earth and sky as witnesses: I've set life and death in front of you, a blessing and a curse. Choose life so you and your descendants will live. Choose life 20by loving the LORD your God, obeying him, holding tight to him. This is your life and length of days: to live in the land he swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."</span>
