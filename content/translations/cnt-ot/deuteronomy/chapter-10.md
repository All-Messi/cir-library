## Deuteronomy Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, the LORD said, 'Carve out your own two stone tablets like the first ones, come up to me on the mountain, and make a wooden Ark. 2I'll write on the tablets what was on the ones you shattered. Put them in the Ark.' 3I made an Ark out of acacia wood and hewed out two stone tablets like the first ones and carried them up the mountain. 4He wrote the Ten Commandments on them that he'd given you on the mountain out of the fire when you assembled. He gave them to me. 5I came down and put the tablets in the Ark, and there they are." [6The Israelites set out from Beeroth Benejaakan to Moserah. Aaron died and was buried there, and his son Eleazar began to serve as priest. 7From there they set out for Gudgodah, then to Jotbathah, a land full of streams. 8At that time, the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark, to stand in his presence, to serve him, and bless in his name till now. 9That's why Levi doesn't have a territory with his kin. The LORD is his inheritance—like the LORD your God told him.] 10"I stayed on the mountain 40 days and nights like the first time. The LORD listened to me that time, too, and didn't destroy you. 11He said, 'Go on with your journey ahead of the people so they can take over the land.' 12"Now, Israel, what does the LORD require from you but to respect him, follow his ways, love him, serve him with all your heart and soul, 13and keep his commandments and statutes for your own good? 14The sky and highest heaven, the earth and everything in it belong to him. 15Yet he set his affection on your ancestors and chose their descendants above all the other nations, as it is now. 16Circumcise your heart and don't stiffen your neck. 17He is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, strong, awesome God that doesn't show favoritism or take bribes. 18He carries out justice for orphans and widows, and loves foreigners by giving them food and clothes. 19So love foreigners because you were foreigners in Egypt. 20Respect the LORD, serve him, hold onto him, swear by him. 21He's your praise and your God, who has done for you the great, awesome things you've seen. 22Your ancestors went down to Egypt 70 people total. He's made you as countless as the stars.</span>
