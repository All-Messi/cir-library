## Deuteronomy Chapter 10

### The Second Stone Tablets

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“At</em><em> that time</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> said, ‘Carve out </em><em>your own </em><em>two stone tablets like the first ones, come up to me on t</em><em>he mountain, and make a wooden A</em><em>rk.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> write on the tablets what was on the ones</em><em> you shattered. P</em><em>ut t</em><em>hem in the A</em><em>rk.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> made an A</em><em>rk </em><em>out </em><em>of acacia wood and </em><em>hewed</em><em> out two </em><em>stone </em><em>tablets like the first ones and </em><em>carried them </em><em>up the mountain.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> wrote </em><em>the Ten Commandments on them that he’d given</em><em> you on the mountain out of the fire </em><em>when you assembled. He</em><em> gave them to me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> came d</em><em>own and put the tablets in the A</em><em>rk, and there they are</em><em>.”</span>

### [6The Israelites set out from Beeroth Benejaakan to Moserah. Aaron died and was buried there, and his son Eleazar began to serve as priest. 7From there they set out for Gudgodah, then to Jotbathah, a land full of streams. 8At that time, Yahveh set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark, to stand in his presence, to serve him, and bless in his name till now. 9That’s why Levi doesn’t have a territory with his kin. Yahveh is his inheritance—like Yahveh your God told him.]


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“I</em><em> stayed on the mountain </em><em>40</em><em> days and </em><em>nights like the first time. Yahveh</em><em> list</em><em>ened to me that time, too, and</em><em> </em><em>didn’t</em><em> destroy you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> said, ‘Go on with your journey ahead of the people so they can take over the land.’ </em> 	<strong>Fear the L</strong><strong>ORD</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“Now</em><em>, Israel, what does </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> require from </em><em>you</em><em> but to </em><em>respect </em><em>him, </em><em>follow his ways, love him, </em><em>serve him with </em><em>all </em><em>your heart and soul, </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>keep his commandments and statutes for your </em><em>own </em><em>good?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> sky and highest heaven, </em><em>the earth and everything in it belong to him. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> he set his affection</em><em> </em><em>on your ancestors and chose their descendants above all the </em>other<em> nations, as it is now. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Circumcise</em><em> your heart and don’t stiffen your neck. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, strong, awesome God that doesn’t show favoritism or take bribes. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> carries out justice for orphans and widows, and loves foreigners by giving them food and clothes. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> love foreigners because you were foreigners in Egypt. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Respect</em><em> Yahveh, serve him, hold onto him, swear by him. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>He’s</em><em> your praise and your God, who has done for you the great, awesome things you’ve seen. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Your</em><em> ancestors went down to Egypt 70 people total. He’s made you as countless as the stars.</span>
