<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Y</em><em>ou’re to observe </em><em>t</em><em>hese statutes </em><em>and judgments </em><em>as long as you live.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>D</em><em>estroy the places where these nations worship their gods—on hills</em><em> and</em><em> mountains and under every green tree.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Tear down their alt</em><em>a</em><em>rs, smash their </em>sacred<em> pillars, burn their Asherah poles, cut down </em><em>the</em><em> carved images of their gods, erase their name from those places. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><em>Don’t conduct yourselves that way with the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> your God. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Look to him where he designates. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Take your burnt offerings there, your sacrifices, your tithes and contributions, your offerings for fulfilling a vow, and your freewill offerings, the firstborn in your herds and flocks. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Eat there with the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> and celebrate in your endeavors. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Don’t do like we’re doing here today, with all of you </em>doing<em> what seems right to you. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>You haven’t yet come to the resting place the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> giving you. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>When he gives you security from your enemies, </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>do everything I command you where he designates in one of your tribes—[</em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>] </em><strong><sup>12b</sup></strong>you, <em>your children, your male and female servants, and the Levite inside your gates (</em><em>since he doesn’t have any inheritance with you</em><em>).

### 15“But, you can butcher and eat meat inside your gates however you like with the LORD’s blessing. The ceremonially clean and unclean can eat it, as with the gazelle and the deer. 16Only don’t eat the blood; drain it out on the ground. 17Don’t eat inside your gates the tenth of your grain, any offering for fulfilling a vow, or your freewill offerings and contributions. 18Eat them with the LORD where he designates and celebrate your endeavors. 19Make sure you don’t leave him anytime in life. 		20“When the LORD extends your border and you want some meat, go on and eat it. 21If the place he designates is too far away, butcher animals from your herds and flocks where you live. 22Just like you eat a gazelle or deer, whether you’re ceremonially clean or unclean. [23-24] 25Don’t eat the blood, so things will go well for you and your descendants; you’ll be doing what’s right in front of God. 26But where he designates take your holy things and offerings to fulfill a vow. 27Offer your burnt offerings on the altar, pour out the blood on the altar, and eat the meat. [28] 29“When the LORD cuts off the nations you overtakesg, 30don’t asksg how they serve their gods so you can do that. 31They do for their gods every disgusting thing the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters to their gods.  32“Do what I tell you, nothing more or less.  	Deut 12:15-32 Warning Against Idolatry
