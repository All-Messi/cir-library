## Deuteronomy Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If a prophet or dreamer arises and gives you a sign or wonder 2that comes true, and uses it to say, 'Let's serve other gods,' 3ignore him. The LORD's testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul. 4Follow him, respect him, keep his commandments, listen to him, serve him, hold onto him. 5Execute that prophet or dreamer. He has advocated rebellion against the LORD who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery. He's seducing you to leave the LORD. That's how you're to purge evil from among you. 6"If your brother, your son or daughter, the wife you love, your close friend tempts you privately to serve other gods—7of people near or far, from one end of the earth to the other—8don't yield to them. Don't show mercy or cover it up. 9Execute them. Be the first to strike against them, then the other people will join in. 10Stone them to death, because they have tried to tempt you away from the LORD your God that brought you out of slavery in Egypt. 11Israel will hear about it and show respect, and not do such a sinful thing again. 12-13"If you hear that some worthless individuals have tempted the people in their city to serve other gods, 14investigate the matter thoroughly. If it's true, 15strike them with the sword. Destroy the city, its people, and their livestock. 16Gather its spoil in its open square and burn it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Make the city a permanent ruin; don't rebuild it. 17Get rid of any plunder marked for destruction so the LORD will turn his furious anger away, have mercy on you, and make a big nation out of you—like he swore to your ancestors.
