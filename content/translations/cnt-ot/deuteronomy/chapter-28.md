<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If you diligently obey the LORD your God, he'll set you high above every nation on earth. 2These blessings will come on you:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The LORD will send disease on you till none of you are left in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The LORD will strike you with consumption, fever, inflammation,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The sky above you will be bronze, and the ground under you will be</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The LORD will turn rain into dust. It'll come down on you till you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The LORD will let your enemies defeat you. You'll go out against them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> You'll grope at noon like a blind man in the dark; You'll be oppressed and robbed continually, and nobody will be there to save you. there. 37You'll become something to abhor, a proverb, a taunt in the nation where the LORD drives you. you'll sink lower and lower. 44He'll lend to you, but you won't lend to him. He'll be the head; you'll be the tail. 45"These curses will come on you till they destroy you, because you wouldn't obey the LORD. 46They'll become a sign and a wonder on you and your descendants forever. 47Since you didn't serve him with joy and happiness for the abundance of everything, 48you'll serve the enemies he sends against you, and you'll do so in hunger, thirst, nakedness, and the lack of everything. He'll put an iron yoke on your neck till he's destroyed you. 49"The LORD will bring a nation against you from the end of the earth like a swooping eagle, a nation whose language you can't understand. 50It'll be a nation that doesn't respect the old or favor the young. 51It'll eat the offspring of your herd and the produce from your ground. It won't leave you any grain, new wine, olive oil, increase in your herd, or the young in your flock till its people wipe you out. 52It will besiege you in your towns till your high, fortified walls you trusted come down all over your land. 53In the sieges you'll be so oppressed you'll eat the offspring of your own body, the sons and daughters the LORD gave you. 54Your refined, cultured gentleman will be hostile toward his brother, the wife he cherishes, his children that remain. 55He won't give a one of them any of his children's flesh he's eating, because he won't have anything left during the oppressive siege. 56Your refined, cultured lady that wouldn't walk on the ground barefoot, will be hostile toward the husband she cherishes, her son and daughter, 57the afterbirth from between her legs, the children she bears. She'll eat them secretly for lack of anything else during the oppressive siege. 58"If you don't observe the laws in this scroll and respect this honored and awesome name, 'The LORD Your God' [Yahveh-Elohekha], 59he'll bring severe plagues, miserable chronic diseases on you and your descendants. 60He'll bring on you Egypt's diseases that you feared and still cling to you. 61He'll even bring on you sicknesses and plagues that aren't in this scroll. 62"Although you were like stars in the sky, you'll end up being few. 63As the LORD delighted in prospering you, he'll delight in destroying you. He'll tear you from the land you're entering 64and scatter you among the nations from one end of the world to the other. You'll serve wooden and stone gods there. 65You won't find anywhere to rest your feet. He'll give you a cringing heart, failing eyes, despairing souls. 66Your life will hang uncertain in front of you, and you'll dread night and day with no assurance that you'll live. 67In the morning you'll say, 'Oh that it was evening!' In the evening you'll say, 'Oh that it was morning!' 68The LORD will take you back to Egypt in ships. You'll never see your country again. You'll try to sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but nobody will buy you."</span>
