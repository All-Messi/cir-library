## Deuteronomy Chapter **15**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong><em>“At the end of every seven years, cancel debts. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Creditors are to let go of what they’ve loaned to their </em>fellow<em> </em>Hebrews<em>. Don’t exact it from them; the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has canceled the </em>debt<em>. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>You can exact it from a foreigner, but not from fellow citizens. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>There won’t be any poor among you because the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will bless you like he promised </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>if you obey this commandment. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Lend to other nations, but don’t borrow </em>from them<em>. You’ll rule other nations; they won’t rule you.</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“If there are poor fellow citizens in your town, be sensitive. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Be willing to lend them what they need. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Don’t harbor the selfish thought, ‘The seventh year is coming, the year of debt cancelation,’ and not help them. They may call out to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, and it’ll be a sin on you. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Give generously without regret so the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will bless what you undertake. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You’ll always have poor people in your land. Be willing to open your hand to your kin, the needy, the poor.</em><strong>  </strong><strong>	 </strong></span>

### Release of Hebrew Slaves 12“If you buy Hebrew men or women, they’ll serve you six years and go free the seventh. 13When you set them free, don’t send them away with nothing. 14Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor, your wine vat. Give to them in proportion to how the LORD has blessed you. 15Remember, you were a slave in Egypt, and he redeemed you. 16If a servant says he doesn’t want to leave, because he loves you and your household and gets along well with you, 17pierce his ear with an awl. He’ll be your servant permanently. Do the same thing with a maidservant. 18Don’t let it bother you to set servants free. They’ve given you six years with twice the service a hired hand gives. That way the LORD will bless you in whatever you do. Sacrifice of Firstborn Male Animals 19“Consecrate to the LORD the male firstborn in your herd and flock. Don’t work the firstborn in your herd or shear the firstborn in your flock. 20You and your family will eat it every year with the LORD where he designates. 21Don’t sacrifice it if it has any serious defect like lameness or blindness. 22Eat it at home; ceremonially clean and unclean alike can eat it—like a gazelle or deer. 23Only don’t eat its blood. Drain it out on the ground. 	Deut 15:12-23 Passover Festival
