## Deuteronomy Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“When</em><em> people go to court and the judges decide their case, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>if</em><em> the offender deserves to be scourged, the judge will make the offender lie down and be scourged in his presence the number of stripes appropriate to the offence. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> can scourge him 40 times at most. More than that would be despising him. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> muzzle an ox while it’s threshing. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“When</em><em> brothers live together and one dies with no son, the wife of the deceased can’t remarry outside the family. Her brother-in-law will take her as his wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Her</em><em> first son will carry on her dead husband’s lineage so it won’t disappear from Israel. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> the </em>brother-in-law<em> doesn’t want to take his brother’s wife, she’s to go to the elders at the gate and say, ‘My brother-in-law refuses to carry on my husband’s name in Israel. He doesn’t want to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to me.’ </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> elders will send for him and talk to him about it. If he persists and says, ‘I don’t want to take her,’ </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>she’s</em><em> to take his sandal off, spit in his face, and declare, ‘That’s what’s done to the man who doesn’t build up his brother’s house.’ </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>His</em><em> name in Israel will be ‘The house of the man whose sandal’s off </em><em>[</em>Bet-chaluts-hanna‘al<em>].</em><em>’ </em><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>“If</em><em> two men are fighting and one of the wives comes to help her husband by grabbing his attacker’s testicles, </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>cut</em><em> her hand off. Don’t show mercy. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> have different-sized weights</em><em> </em><em>in your bags, </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> don’t have different-sized measures in your houses. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Use</em><em> full-sized, exact weights and measures so you’ll live long in the land. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Yahveh</em><em> detests whoever </em><em>cheats with weights and measures. </em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> forget what Amalek did when you came out of Egypt. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> attacked the stragglers in the rear when you were faint and tired. He didn’t fear God. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> Yahveh your God has given you peace from all your </em>other <em>enemies, remember to totally erase the memory of Amalek.</span>
