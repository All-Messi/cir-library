## Deuteronomy Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“When</em><em> a man gets married and his wife becomes displeasing to him because he finds something wrong with her, he’s to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> she marries another man </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> he divorces her or dies, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>her</em><em> first husband can’t marry her again because she’s been defiled. That would be detestable to Yahveh. Don’t bring sin on the land he’s giving you. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“When</em><em> a man gets married, he won’t be charged with any military duty for a year. He’ll be free at home to make his wife happy. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> take a hand mill or upper millstone as a pledge. You’d be taking a livelihood as a pledge. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>“If</em><em> someone kidnaps and enslaves or sells a fellow citizen, execute the kidnapper. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“Keep</em><em> an eye on a spot of leprosy and follow the priests’ instructions. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Remember</em><em> what Yahveh did to Miriam on the way from Egypt.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Deut 24:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you loan somebody something, don’t go into his house to get it. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Let</em><em> him bring it out to you. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> he’s poor, don’t keep his pledge overnight. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Give</em><em> it back at sundown so he can sleep in his cloak and have a good attitude toward you. Yahveh will consider you good.  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> oppress hired hands that’ are poor, citizen or foreigner. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Pay</em><em> them each day before sundown. They’re poor and their life depends on it. That way they won’t call out to Yahveh, and it becomes sin in you. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> execute parents for children or vice versa. Execute each person for that person’s sin. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> pervert justice with a foreigner or orphan, or take a widow’s cloak as a pledge. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Remember</em><em> that you were a slave in Egypt and Yahveh freed you. That’s why I’m telling you this. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you harvest your field and overlook a bundle, don’t go back to get it. Leave it for foreigners, orphans, or widows. Yahveh your God will bless you in your work. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> you beat the limbs on your olive tree, don’t go back </em><em>over them. </em>Leave them<em> for foreigners, orphans, and widows. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> you gather grapes from your vineyard, don’t pick back over them. </em>Leave them<em> for foreigners, orphans, and widows. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Remember</em><em> that you were a slave in Egypt. That’s why I’m telling you this.</span>
