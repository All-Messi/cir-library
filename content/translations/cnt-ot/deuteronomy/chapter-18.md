## Deuteronomy Chapter 18

### Offerings for Priests and Levites

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“The</em><em> Levitical priests won’t inherit territory. They’ll eat Yahveh’s offerings by fire and his portion. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> is their inheritance like he promised. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <em>“T</em><em>his</em><em> is what</em><em> the people owe </em><em>the priests.</em><em> When they </em><em>offer a sacrifice</em><em>—</em><em>ox or sheep</em><em>—they’l</em><em>l give the priest the shoulder,</em><em> </em><em>two cheeks, and stomach.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> give him the first part of the harvest of their grain, new wine, and olive oil, as well as the first shearing of their sheep. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Out</em><em> of all the tribes, Yahveh has permanently chosen </em>Levi<em> and his descendants to stand and serve in his name.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“If</em><em> a Levite living in a town in Israel solemnly wants to come to where Yahveh designates, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>then</em><em> he’ll serve </em>there <em>in Yahveh’s name like his fellow Levites. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> eat equal portions as well as what he receives from selling his fathers’ property.</em></span>

### Disgusting Practices Prohibited


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you go to a land, don’t do the disgusting things its people do. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>No</em><em> one will burn a son or daughter as an offering, use fortunetelling, practice witchcraft, interpret omens, use sorcery, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>cast</em><em> spells, call up the dead, be a medium or spiritualist. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Yahveh</em><em> detests whoever does those things. It’s because </em><em>of such detestable things that he’s going to drive those people out. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Be</em><em> blameless toward him.</em><strong><sup>	</sup></strong> 	<strong>Prophets</strong><strong> </strong><strong>True and False</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“Those</em><em> nations listen to witches and fortunetellers, but Yahveh your God doesn’t allow that. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> raise up a prophet like me from among you; listen to him. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> corresponds to what you asked Yahveh in assembly at Horeb/</em>Sinai<em>, ‘Don’t let us hear his voice again or see this great fire anymore. We’re afraid we’ll die.’ </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Yahveh</em><em> told me, ‘They’ve spoken well. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> raise up a prophet from among their fellow citizens like you. I’ll give him my message, and he’ll tell them everything I’ve told him. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> hold responsible whoever ignores what he says in my name. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> any prophet will die that tries to speak in my name when I haven’t authorized it. The same thing applies to</em> anybody<em> that speaks in the name of other gods. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> may wonder how you can tell what I haven’t said. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> a prophet speaks in my name and it doesn’t happen, I didn’t say it. The prophet has spoken without my authority. Don’t pay any attention to </em><em><u>him</u></em><em>.’</em><strong></span>
