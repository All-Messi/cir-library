## Deuteronomy Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Levitical priests won't inherit territory. They'll eat the LORD's offerings by fire and his portion. 2He is their inheritance like he promised. 3"This is what the people owe the priests. When they offer a sacrifice—ox or sheep—they'll give the priest the shoulder, two cheeks, and stomach. 4They'll give him the first part of the harvest of their grain, new wine, and olive oil, as well as the first shearing of their sheep. 5Out of all the tribes, the LORD has permanently chosen Levi and his descendants to stand and serve in his name. 6"If a Levite living in a town in Israel solemnly wants to come to where the LORD designates, 7then he'll serve there in the LORD's name like his fellow Levites. 8He'll eat equal portions as well as what he receives from selling his fathers' property. 9"When you go to a land, don't do the disgusting things its people do. 10No one will burn a son or daughter as an offering, use fortunetelling, practice witchcraft, interpret omens, use sorcery, 11cast spells, call up the dead, be a medium or spiritualist. 12The LORD detests whoever does those things. It's because of such detestable things that he's going to drive those people out. 13Be blameless toward him. 14"Those nations listen to witches and fortunetellers, but the LORD your God doesn't allow that. 15He'll raise up a prophet like me from among you; listen to him. 16That corresponds to what you asked the LORD in assembly at Horeb/Sinai, 'Don't let us hear his voice again or see this great fire anymore. We're afraid we'll die.' 17The LORD told me, 'They've spoken well. 18I'll raise up a prophet from among their fellow citizens like you. I'll give him my message, and he'll tell them everything I've told him. 19I'll hold responsible whoever ignores what he says in my name. 20But any prophet will die that tries to speak in my name when I haven't authorized it. The same thing applies to anybody that speaks in the name of other gods. 21You may wonder how you can tell what I haven't said. 22When a prophet speaks in my name and it doesn't happen, I didn't say it. The prophet has spoken without my authority. Don't pay any attention to him.'</span>
