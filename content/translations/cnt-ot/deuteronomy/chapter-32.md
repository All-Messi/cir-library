<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen, sky; let me speak;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Let my teaching fall like rain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> His work is perfect;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> His people have acted corruptly toward him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Is that the way you repay the LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Remember the old days;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> For the LORD's people are his portion;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He found them a desert land;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The LORD alone guided them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He made them ride above the high places of the earth;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They made him jealous with foreign gods</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They sacrificed to demons that aren't God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They neglected the Rock that begot them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He said, 'I'll hide from them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They made me jealous with what's not God;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> A fire has kindled my anger,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They'll be wasted by famine</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> A sword will bereave them outside,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I would've said, 'I'll cut them in pieces</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Oh that they'd be wise and understand</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> How could one chase 1,000</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Their rock is certainly not like our Rock;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Their grapevine grows from Sodom's vines</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Their wine is snake venom,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Vengeance and retribution are my business;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Who ate the fat of their sacrifices</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> See now that I'm the One;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Indeed, I lift up my hand to the sky</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> When I sharpen my flashing sword</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> I'll make my arrows drunk with blood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Celebrate, Gentiles, with his people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Then Moses came with Joshua and presented the song to the people. 45When he'd finished, 46he told them, "Take my warnings to heart. Tell your sons to observe them carefully. 47It's not an idle message; it's your life. It affects how long you'll live in the land you're crossing Jordan to take over."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> The LORD told Moses that same day, 49"Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, in Moab across from Jericho, and look across at Canaan. 50Then die on the mountain and pass on to your people, like Aaron your brother did on Mount Hor. 51You broke faith with me among the Israelites at the water of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin. You didn't honor me as holy among them. 52You'll see the land at a distance, but you can't go in."</span>
