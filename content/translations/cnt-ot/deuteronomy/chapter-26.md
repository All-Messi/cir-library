## Deuteronomy Chapter **26**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“Once you’re living in the land, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>put some of its first produce in a basket and go where the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> chooses to put his name. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Go to the priest and say, </em> <em>‘I declare to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> my God that I’ve entered the land he swore he’d give us.’ </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>The priest will set </em>the basket<em> down at the altar. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>You’ll answer, ‘My ancestor was an Aramean nomad. He went down to Egypt and lived few in number, but he became a big strong nation there. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The Egyptians abused us with hard labor, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>and we cried out to our ancestors’ God. He heard us and saw our misery, toil, and oppression. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>He brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and outstretched arm, with terror, signs, and wonders. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>He brought us here and gave us this land, flowing with milk and honey. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I’ve brought the first produce of the ground you’ve given me.’ Set it down by the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> and worship him there. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You, the Levite, the foreigner among you will celebrate over the good he’s given you and your family.</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong></span>

### 12“When you pay a tenth of your crop the third year, give it to the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow in your towns so they can eat till they’re satisfied. 13Say in front of the LORD,  ‘I’ve removed the sacred portion from my house, and given it to the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow. I haven’t disobeyed any of your commandments: 14I’ve not eaten some of it while in mourning, removed any of it while ceremonially unclean, or offered any of it to the dead. 15Look down from your holy house in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you’ve given us, a land flowing with milk and honey—like you swore to our ancestors.’   Obeying the LORD 16“Today the LORD commands you to do these ordinances with all your heart and soul.


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><em>Today you’ve declared that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> is your God and that you’ll follow his ways, keep his commandments, listen to him.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Today the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has declared that you’re his people, the treasured possession he promised you’d be. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He has declared <em>that he’ll set you high above all </em>other <em>nations for praise, fame, and honor; and you’ll be consecrated to him.”</em><strong>	</strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>
