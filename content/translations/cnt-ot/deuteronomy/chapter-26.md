## Deuteronomy Chapter 26

### Firstfruits and Tithes

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“Once</em><em> you’re living in the land, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>put</em><em> some of its first produce in a basket and go where Yahveh chooses to put his name. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> to the priest and say, </em> <em>‘I declare to Yahveh my God that I’ve entered the land he swore he’d give us.’ </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> priest will set </em>the basket<em> down at the altar. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> answer, ‘My ancestor was an Aramean nomad. He went down to Egypt and lived few in number, but he became a big strong nation there. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Egyptians abused us with hard labor, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>we cried out to our ancestors’ God. He heard us and saw our misery, toil, and oppression. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and outstretched arm, with terror, signs, and wonders. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> brought us here and gave us this land, flowing with milk and honey. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> brought the first produce of the ground you’ve given me.’ Set it down by Yahveh and worship him there. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You</em><em>, the Levite, the foreigner among you will celebrate over the good he’s given you and your family.</em><strong></span>

I haven’t disobeyed any of your commandments: </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> not eaten some of it while in mourning, removed any of it while ceremonially unclean, or offered any of it to the dead. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Look</em><em> down from your holy house in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you’ve given us, a land flowing with milk and honey—like you swore to our ancestors.’  </em> 	<strong>Obeying the L</strong><strong>ORD</strong></span>
