## Deuteronomy Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Once you're living in the land, 2put some of its first produce in a basket and go where the LORD chooses to put his name. 3Go to the priest and say, 'I declare to the LORD my God that I've entered the land he swore he'd give us.' 4The priest will set the basket down at the altar. 5You'll answer, 'My ancestor was an Aramean nomad. He went down to Egypt and lived few in number, but he became a big strong nation there. 6The Egyptians abused us with hard labor, 7and we cried out to our ancestors' God. He heard us and saw our misery, toil, and oppression. 8He brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and outstretched arm, with terror, signs, and wonders. 9He brought us here and gave us this land, flowing with milk and honey. 10I've brought the first produce of the ground you've given me.' Set it down by the LORD and worship him there. 11You, the Levite, the foreigner among you will celebrate over the good he's given you and your family. 12"When you pay a tenth of your crop the third year, give it to the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow in your towns so they can eat till they're satisfied. 13Say in front of the LORD, 'I've removed the sacred portion from my house, and given it to the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow. I haven't disobeyed any of your commandments: 14I've not eaten some of it while in mourning, removed any of it while ceremonially unclean, or offered any of it to the dead. 15Look down from your holy house in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you've given us, a land flowing with milk and honey—like you swore to our ancestors.' 16"Today the LORD commands you to do these ordinances with all your heart and soul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Today you've declared that the LORD is your God and that you'll follow his ways, keep his commandments, listen to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Today the LORD has declared that you're his people, the treasured possession he promised you'd be. 19He has declared that he'll set you high above all other nations for praise, fame, and honor; and you'll be consecrated to him."</span>
