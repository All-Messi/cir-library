## Deuteronomy Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> sacrifice an ox or sheep that has a blemish. Yahveh detests that.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“If</em><em> a case is too hard for you to decide in your courts—between one kind of homicide and another, between one kind of lawsuit and another, between one kind of assault and another—go to where Yahveh designates. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> to the Levitical priest or judge that’s </em>in office<em> and lay the case in front of him. He’ll render a verdict. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Carry</em><em> out all its terms. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Follow</em><em> the law he teaches you in the verdict he gives. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> person will die that ignores the priest or judge. That’s how you’re to purge evil from Israel. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em>other <em>people will hear </em>about it <em>and show respect, and not act presumptuously again.</em><strong></span>

### The King


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you’re in the land, you’ll want to install a king like the nations around you. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Install</em><em> a fellow citizen that Yahveh chooses. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> must not multiply horses for himself or send people to Egypt to multiply them. Yahveh has said never to go back there. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> must not multiply wives; they’ll turn his heart away. He must not amass silver and gold for himself.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“When</em><em> he sits on the throne, he’s to write a copy of this Law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>It’ll</em><em> be with him to read all his life </em> <em>so he’ll learn to respect Yahveh by doing what it says, </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <em>so</em><em> he won’t lord it over fellow citizens, </em> <em>so he won’t deviate from its commandments, </em> so <em>he and his descendants will continue long in his kingdom.</span>
