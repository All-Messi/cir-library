## Isaiah Chapter 43

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But this is what the LORD your creator says, Jacob,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When you pass through the sea, I'm with you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Since you're precious to me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You don't need to be afraid, because I'm with you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll say to the north, 'Give them up!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Bring out the blind, though they have eyes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Gather the nations; assemble the peoples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'm the LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'm the One that predicted it, did it, and proclaimed it</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> From eternity I'm God;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> This is what the LORD your Rescuer says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'm your King, Israel's Creator,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But don't just recall those former things</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Duly note something new I'm doing now;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Wild animals will honor me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The people I created for myself at that time</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You haven't brought me the sheep for your burnt offerings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You haven't bought any calamus for me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Remember me; let's debate our case together;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> But from the time of your first ancestor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> So I profaned the priests of the sanctuary;</span>
