## Isaiah Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD is laying the earth waste, defacing its surface, scattering its residents. 2People and priests, servants and masters, maids and mistresses, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors—everyone will be affected. 3The earth will be completely despoiled because the LORD said so. 4The earth withers, and its people waste away, even its high-ranking ones, 5because they've polluted it by sinning against God's laws, statutes, and everlasting covenant. 6So a curse devastates the earth, and its people have to pay for their guilt. They're burned; there aren't many left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> There's no new wine to drink;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Celebrating with tambourines has stopped;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They don't drink wine and sing;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The city in chaos has broken-down walls;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Stragglers in the streets holler for wine;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The city's in ruins;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> That's the way it is in the rural areas too—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But a few raise their voices and shout for joy;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So honor him in the east,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> In the distance we hear singing,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Terror, pit, and snare threaten you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The earth breaks into pieces;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> It staggers like a drunk;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> At that time, the LORD will punish the gods in the sky above</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They'll be rounded up</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The moon will fade,</span>
