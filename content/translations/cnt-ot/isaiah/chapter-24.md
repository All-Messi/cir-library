## Isaiah Chapter 24

### Devastation of the Earth

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD is laying the earth waste, defacing its surface, scattering its residents. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>People and priests, servants and masters, maids and mistresses, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors—everyone will be affected. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The earth will be completely despoiled because the LORD said so. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The earth withers, and its people waste away, even its high-ranking ones, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>because they’ve polluted it by sinning against God’s laws, statutes, and everlasting covenant. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So a curse devastates the earth, and its people have to pay for their guilt. They’re burned; there aren’t many left.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 24:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> There’s no new wine to drink; the grapevines have dried up; the light-hearted sigh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Celebrating with tambourines has stopped; the noise from revelers has ceased; happiness with harps has disappeared.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They don’t drink wine and sing; alcohol tastes bitter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The city in chaos has broken-down walls; its houses are boarded up to keep intruders out.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 24:7-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Stragglers in the streets holler for wine; joy has turned to gloom; happiness has vanished.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The city’s in ruins; its gates are battered down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> That’s the way it is in the rural areas too— as when they shake the olive tree or glean for grapes.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 24:11-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>But</em><em> </em>a few raise their voices and shout for joy; they shout from the west about the majesty of the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So honor him in the east, the God of Israel in lands beyond the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> In the distance we hear singing, <em>“</em><em>Honor</em><em> to the </em><em>Righteous</em><em> One.”</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 24:14-16</p>

### But I say, “Misfortune awaits me! Misfortune awaits me! 			The devious deal deviously, so deviously!”


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Terror, pit, and snare threaten you, people of the earth;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> the one that runs from terror falls in a pit; the one that climbs out of the pit gets caught in a snare.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 24:17-18</p>

### a The windows in the sky rain down destruction; the foundations of the earth quake.


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The earth breaks into pieces; earthquakes split it apart and shake it violently.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> It staggers like a drunk; it leans like a shack because its sins press heavily against it; it will fall over permanently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> At that time, the LORD will punish the gods in the sky above and the kings on the earth below.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They’ll be rounded up like prisoners in a dungeon and finally punished,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The moon will fade, and the sun will lose its brightness compared to the LORD of hosts, who will reign on Zion and display his glory to his people’s leaders.</span>
