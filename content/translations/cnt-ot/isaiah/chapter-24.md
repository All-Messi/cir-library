## Isaiah Chapter **24**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD is laying the earth waste, defacing its surface, scattering its residents. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>People and priests, servants and masters, maids and mistresses, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors—everyone will be affected. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The earth will be completely despoiled because the LORD said so. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The earth withers, and its people waste away, even its high-ranking ones, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>because they’ve polluted it by sinning against God’s laws, statutes, and everlasting covenant. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So a curse devastates the earth, and its people have to pay for their guilt. They’re burned; there aren’t many left.                        	<strong>Is</strong><strong> 24:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>There’s no new wine to drink; the grapevines have dried up; the light-hearted sigh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Celebrating with tambourines has stopped; the noise from revelers has ceased; happiness with harps has disappeared.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They don’t drink wine and sing; alcohol tastes bitter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The city in chaos has broken-down walls; its houses are boarded up to keep intruders out.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 24:7-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Stragglers in the streets holler for wine; joy has turned to gloom; happiness has vanished.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The city’s in ruins; its gates are battered down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>That’s the way it is in the rural areas too— as when they shake the olive tree or glean for grapes.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 24:11-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> </em>a few raise their voices and shout for joy; they shout from the west about the majesty of the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So honor him in the east, the God of Israel in lands beyond the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>In the distance we hear singing, <em>“</em><em>Honor</em><em> to the </em><em>Righteous</em><em> One.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 24:14-16</strong> But I say, <em>“</em><em>Misfortune awaits</em><em> me! </em><em>Misfortune awaits</em><em> me!</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	The </em><em>devi</em><em>ous</em><em> </em><em>deal </em><em>devi</em><em>ously,</em><em> so deviously!</em><em>”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Terror, pit, and snare threaten you, people of the earth;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>the one that runs from terror falls in a pit; the one that climbs out of the pit gets caught in a snare.					<strong>Is</strong><strong> 24:17-</strong><strong>18a</strong> The windows in the sky rain down destruction; the foundations of the earth quake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The earth breaks into pieces; earthquakes split it apart and shake it violently.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>It staggers like a drunk; it leans like a shack because its sins press heavily against it; it will fall over permanently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>At that time, the LORD will punish the gods in the sky above and the kings on the earth below.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They’ll be rounded up like prisoners in a dungeon and finally punished,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The moon will fade, and the sun will lose its brightness compared to the LORD of hosts, who will reign on Zion and display his glory to his people’s leaders.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>24:18b-23</strong> <strong>Praise for Judgment and Salvation</strong></span>
