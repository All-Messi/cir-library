## Isaiah Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But listen now, Jacob my servant,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> This is what the LORD says who created you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> As I'll pour out water on thirsty ground</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> This one will say, "I belong to the LORD";</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> This is what the King of Israel says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who is like me? Speak up;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don't tremble in fear;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Those who carve idols don't accomplish anything because their precious objects can't do anything. Their worshippers don't know that; so they'll be put to shame. 10Who but fools make their own gods and then worship them? 11The craftsmen are mere mortals. They'll all gather with the worshipers, take their stand, and go down in terror and infamy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A blacksmith shapes iron into a cutting tool over coals in his forge. He beats it with hammers till he gets hungry and weak, thirsty and tired. 13Then a carver shapes a block of wood, stretches out a measuring line on it, and draws a pattern on it with red chalk. He works it with chisels and planes to look like a beautiful human figure to set in a little shrine in somebody's house. 14He cuts down a cedar, takes a cypress or oak, and plants a fir tree in the woods, and the rain makes it grow. 15-16It becomes something he can burn. So he burns half of it to warm himself up and say "Ah, I'm warm; the heat feels good." Or he bakes bread and eats a roast and is satisfied. 17He carves the other half into an image, his god. He falls down to it, worships it, and prays to it, "Deliver me, my god."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They don't understand because God has glazed over their eyes so they can't see, and closed their minds so they can't think. 19The one that made it doesn't stop to reflect,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He eats ashes and trusts something that can't help him. He doesn't ask, "Am I holding something fake in my hand?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I've wiped out your transgressions like a dark cloud,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Shout for joy, sky, because the LORD made you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> This is what the LORD your Redeemer says</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I expose false prophets' omens</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I carry out my prophets' predictions</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I'm the One that tells the deep ocean to dry up</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I say about Cyrus, 'He's my shepherd!</span>
