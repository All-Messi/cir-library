<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When you did awesome things we didn't expect,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> No one has ever heard of a God like you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You visit those who enjoy doing good,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We've all become unclean;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> No one calls on you or reaches out to you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But now, LORD, you're our Father;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don't be angry beyond measure;</span>
