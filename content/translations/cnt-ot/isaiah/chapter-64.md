## Isaiah Chapter 64

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Oh that you’d open the sky and come down and <strong>the mountains would quake in your presence—</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>like a flame that burns brush and boils water— to show yourself to your adversaries so they’d tremble in your presence!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When you did awesome things we didn’t expect, you came down and <strong>the mountains quake</strong><strong>d</strong><strong> in your presence.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>No one has ever heard of a God like you that acts on behalf of people that wait for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You visit those who enjoy doing good, who remember you and your ways. You were angry because we kept sinning for a long time; can we <em>ever </em>be saved?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>We’ve all become unclean; our best efforts are like menstrual rags. We wither like leaves; our sins blow us away like the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>No one calls on you or reaches out to you because you’ve hid from us and delivered us to the consequences of our sins.<strong> </strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 64:1-7</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>	</em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But now, LORD, you’re our Father; we’re the clay, you’re the potter; you’ve made us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Don’t be angry beyond measure; don’t hold our sin against us forever; look now, we’re all your people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Your holy cities have become a desert; Zion is a wasteland; Jerusalem is desolate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Our holy, beautiful Temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned; all our precious things lie in ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Will you limit yourself to this much retribution, <em>or w</em>ill you keep disciplining us no end?<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 64:8-12</strong> <strong>Judgment and Final Salvation</strong></span>
