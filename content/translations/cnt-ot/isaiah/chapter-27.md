## Isaiah Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, the LORD will punish Leviathan with his fierce, big strong sword, Leviathan the swift, slithering snake. He'll kill the dragon that's in the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Then,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I, the LORD, will be its keeper;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I won't be angry anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In time to come, Jacob will take root;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Has the LORD struck Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> No, he contended with Israel by banishing them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So that's how he'll purge Jacob's iniquity;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The fortified towns will be deserted,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When those branches dry up, they'll break off</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yet in time, Israel, the LORD will start gleaning from the Euphrates River to the River of Egypt and gather you up one by one. 13A large trumpet will blow, and the exiles who were perishing in Assyria and Egypt will come to Jerusalem to worship the LORD on his holy mountain.</span>
