<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Egypt</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They'll be demoralized;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll deliver them to a cruel master;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The Nile will dry up;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The canals from the Nile will get foul;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Bulrushes by the Nile and the sown fields beside it</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Fishermen will chant a dirge;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The ones that manufacture linen from combed flax</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Business owners will go bankrupt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The officials in Zoan are simply fools;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Where are your wise men, Pharaoh?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The officials in Zoan are simply fools;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD has stirred up confusion in them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> There's nothing helpless Egypt can do</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The Egyptians will be like women then, cringing with fear as the fist of the LORD of Hosts shakes over them. 17Judah will terrorize Egypt. They'll dread hearing Judah mentioned because the LORD has laid out his purpose against them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> At that time, five cities in Egypt will start speaking Hebrew and swear allegiance to the LORD of Hosts—Heliopolis for one. 19There'll be an altar to him in Egypt and a monument to him at its border, 20a sign and witness. When they call out to him against oppressors, he'll send them a champion to rescue them. 21That's how he'll make himself known to them. They'll even worship with sacrifice and offering, take vows to him and keep them. 22He'll strike Egypt, striking then healing them, so they'll come back to him. 23-24A highway then will run from Egypt to Assyria, and people will travel to each other and worship together. Israel will be the third member in an alliance with Egypt and Assyria, with the LORD's blessing located between the two. 25"Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, Israel my permanent possession."</span>
