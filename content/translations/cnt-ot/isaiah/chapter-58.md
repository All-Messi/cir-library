## Isaiah Chapter 58

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Shout; don't hold back;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They look to me daily and seem to delight to know my ways,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then they wonder, 'Why have we fasted, and you haven't noticed?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You fast only to win disputes and fist fights—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Is that the kind of fast I had in mind for humbling yourselves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Isn't this the kind of fast I had in mind:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Isn't it sharing your food with the hungry,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then your light will break forth like the dawn;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You'll call and he'll answer;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD will always guide you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins</span>
