## Isaiah Chapter 59

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> It's not that the LORD's hand is not too weak to save</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It's your iniquities that have separated you from him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You've defiled your hands with blood,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> None of you brings just suits or argues cases honestly;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You hatch viper eggs and weave spider webs;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your webs can't become clothes;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You hurry to do harm,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You don't know any road that leads to peace;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So justice is a long way off from you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You grope along the wall like the blind</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You growl like bears and moan like pigeons;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You've multiplied your sins right in God's face;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The courts oppose justice;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He put on goodness like a breastplate,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He'll repay his adversaries according to their deeds,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So they'll fear the LORD in the west</span>
