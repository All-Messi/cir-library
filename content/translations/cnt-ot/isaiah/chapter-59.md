## Isaiah Chapter **59**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>It’s not that the LORD’s hand is not too weak to save or his ear too deaf to hear you call.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>It’s your iniquities that have separated you from him; your sins have shut him off from you, so he ignores you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You’ve defiled your hands with blood, your fingers with sin, your lips with lying, your tongues with gossip.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>None of you brings just suits or argues <em>cases</em> honestly; you hide behind double talk and perjury; you conceive schemes and give birth to sin.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 59:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You hatch viper eggs and weave spider webs; whoever eats the eggs dies; snakes hatch from the cracked eggs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Your webs can’t become clothes; you can’t dress yourselves with what you’ve made. Your deeds are sinful; you use your hands for violence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>You hurry to do harm, run to shed blood, and think sinful things; destruction lies scattered along your highways.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>You don’t know any road that leads to peace; you give the wrong directions; whoever follows them gets lost.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 59:5-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>So justice is a long way off <em>from </em><em>you</em>; right living doesn’t help you. You hope for light, but it’s dark here; you look for sunny days but live in gloom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>You grope along the wall like the blind and fumble around like people without eyes; you stumble around as much at noon as you do at dusk, like the dead among the living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>You growl like bears and moan like pigeons; you look for justice, but it doesn’t come; you want salvation, but it’s a distant prospect.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 59:9-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You’ve multiplied your sins right in <em>God’s</em> face; they testify against you. You know you’re sinful;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>you transgress and deny the LORD and turn your backs on him. You advocate oppression and rebellion, conceive and tell lies from the heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The courts oppose justice; it’s nowhere near; truth stumbles in the streets; honesty is illegal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5b-16</sup></strong>The LORD was amazed; it displeased him that there was no justice. Nobody was intervening to help the oppressed; so he brought about salvation himself and sustained it with his goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He put on goodness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he dressed himself in vengeance and wrapped himself with zeal like a mantle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He’ll repay his adversaries according to their deeds, recompense his enemies with his anger, and carry out retribution to the ends of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>So they’ll fear the LORD in the west and honor him from the rising of the sun, because he’ll come like a rushing tide that he drives with the wind. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“A</em><em> redeemer will come to Zion,</em> <em>	</em><em>	to those who turn from </em><em>sin</em><em> in Jacob,”</em> the LORD says.    <strong>Is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>59:15b-20</strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>“This</em><em> is my covenant with you: </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>my Spirit that’s on you,</em> <em>	</em><em>	my message that’s in you </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	won’t leave you, your children, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	or grandchildren from now on.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
