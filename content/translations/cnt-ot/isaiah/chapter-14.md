## Isaiah Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, choose Israel again, and settle them in their own land, foreigners will join Jacob's house. 2The nations will help bring them home. Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the LORD's land, as male and female servants. They'll capture their captors and rule their rulers. 3When the LORD gives them relief from their pain, turmoil, and harsh slavery, 4they'll taunt the king of Babylon:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD has broken the staff of the corrupt,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The whole region is resting and quiet now;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The cypress trees are celebrating over you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Sheol below you is excited to welcome you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Your pomp and the music of your lyres</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> How you've fallen from the sky,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You told yourself</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But, you'll be thrust down to Sheol,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Those who see you will gape and wonder,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The kings of earth lie in honor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> No one will give you a proper burial</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Slaughter his descendants for their father's guilt</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The LORD of Hosts says, "I'll attack Babylon and destroy its reputation, children, and posterity. 23I'll make a marsh out of it, a haunt for hedgehogs, and sweep it with a broom of destruction."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The LORD of Hosts has sworn,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I'll break Assyria when it comes into my land</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> That's what I've planned for the whole region,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The LORD of Hosts has a plan; who's going to stop it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The year King Ahaz died, this oracle came:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I'll pasture the firstborn of my poor,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Wail, gates; cry, city;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> What should we tell any messengers the Philistines send?</span>
