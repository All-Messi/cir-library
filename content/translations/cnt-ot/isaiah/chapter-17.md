## Isaiah Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Damascus</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The villages around Aroer will be deserted;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Fortified towns will disappear from Ephraim,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It will look like a grain field after harvest,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yet some gleanings will be left—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> At that time, people will finally care about their Maker and look to the Holy One of Israel. 8They won't care about the altars, the work of their hands, or rely on what their fingers have made, the Asherah poles, and incense stands. 9Their largest towns will be like places the Hivites and Amorites deserted when the Israelites came. Desolation will prevail.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You've forgotten the God that can save you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Ah, the uproar of many nations</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The nations rumble on like flooding water,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> In the evening Israel will wait in terror,</span>
