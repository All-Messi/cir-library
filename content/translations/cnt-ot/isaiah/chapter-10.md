## Isaiah Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits judges that enact unfair laws</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> What are you going to do when punishment arrives,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> There'll be nothing left for you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'm sending Assyria against my godless nation,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But that's not Assyria's intention.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> It will say, 'My princes will all be kings?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Calno will fall like Carchemish,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As I've done to other kingdoms with idols,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So when the Lord finishes using Assyria to complete his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he'll say, "I'll punish the arrogant king of Assyria and his pompous pride." 13That's because he brags,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But should an axe brag</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So the Lord GOD of Hosts will send</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Israel's light will be that fire,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He'll destroy Assyria's glory like a forest</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So few trees will be left in his "woods"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> At that time, the remnant in Israel and the survivors in Judah that escaped will have the sense to never again rely on allies that want to destroy them. They'll rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, 21-22the Mighty God. 22Then, even though Israel was as numerous as sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. 23The Lord GOD will carry out the total destruction he's decreed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So this is what he says, "My people in Zion, don't be afraid of Assyria that wants to strike you with a rod and threaten you with its staff like Egypt did. 25In a little while, my anger at you will be spent, and I'll redirect it at Assyria. 26I'll scourge it like I massacred Midian at the Rock of Oreb. I'll hold my staff out over the sea and lift it up like I did in Egypt. 27Then I'll lift the Assyrian burden off your shoulders and break its yoke from off your neck."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The Assyrians have passed through Migron,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They've gone over the pass</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Cry out in terror, people in Gallim!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Madmenah has fled;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The enemy will halt his advance at Nob for the day</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The Lord GOD of Hosts will lop off limbs with a terrible crash</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> With an iron axe he'll chop down the undergrowth in its forest,</span>
