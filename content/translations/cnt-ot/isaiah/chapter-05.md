## Isaiah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For the one I love, let me sing a song about his vineyard:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He spaded up the ground, picked up the rocks,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> What could I have done for it that I didn't do?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Let me tell you what I'm going to do with it:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I won't take care of it, prune it, or hoe it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Israel is the LORD's vineyard;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Misfortune awaits you that buy up houses and fields</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I've heard the LORD of Hosts swear,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Misfortune awaits those who get up early to drink alcohol</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Their banquets feature lyres and harps,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So my people will go into exile for ignoring me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Sheol will increase its appetite and eat its fill;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Commoners will be humbled,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by his judgments;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then lambs will graze in their pasture;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Misfortune awaits those who pull iniquity</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Misfortune awaits those</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Misfortune's in store for people that think they're smart,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Misfortune comes on winners at wine drinking</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So, like a flame ignites stubble</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He'll signal to a far-off country;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Nobody from there will get tired or stumble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Its arrows will be sharp; its bows bent;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> It will roar like a lioness, like a young lion;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> It will growl over its prey like the ocean roars;</span>
