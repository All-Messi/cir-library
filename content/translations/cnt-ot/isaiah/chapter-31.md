<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He's wise and brings disaster</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Egyptians are people, not God;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The LORD says to me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Like a hovering bird I'll guard Jerusalem,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Their 'rock' will pass away in panic;</span>
