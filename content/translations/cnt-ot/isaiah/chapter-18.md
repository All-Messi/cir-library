<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ah, land of fluttering wings,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> All of you that live in the world,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Before harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your huge army will be left dead for the mountain buzzards</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> At that time, a nation tall and smooth</span>
