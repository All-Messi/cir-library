## Isaiah Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits the proud crown of Ephraim's drunks,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD has a strong and powerful military agent;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The proud crown of Ephraim's drunks will get tramped on;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> At a later time, the LORD of Hosts will finally become Israel's crown instead,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He'll give their judges a desire to render justice</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But for now the priests and prophets</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Their tables are covered with vomit;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yet they say, "Who's the LORD think he's going to teach?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They say that because he tells them over and over,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So instead, he'll have to speak to his people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He told them, "Here's a place for the weary to rest,"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So the LORD will keep on lining out his message to them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So listen to the LORD's message,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But the Lord GOD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll make justice the measuring line</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll undo your deal with death</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> It'll seize you again and again;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The bed you've built is too short to stretch out on;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The LORD will come like he did at Mount Perazim;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Don't carry on like scoffers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Listen to my question.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When it's planting time,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Doesn't he smooth it out,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> A farmer doesn't thresh dill with a sledge</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Does he crush grain for bread?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> That goes for the LORD of Hosts too,</span>
