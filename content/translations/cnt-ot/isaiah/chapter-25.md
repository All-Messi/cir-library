## Isaiah Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> LORD, you're my God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You've reduced fortified towns to ruble;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So strong people will honor you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will hold a lavish banquet for everybody in the world, a banquet of aged wine and choice meat. 7Here he'll remove the shadow that lies over every country, the veil that covers the nations. 8He'll swallow up death for all time, wipe away everyone's tears, and remove the abuse of his people everywhere. The LORD has said so.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> At that time, people will say, "This is the God we've waited for to save us. He's the LORD; let's celebrate and be glad he's done it." 10His hand will rest on this mountain, and Moab will be trodden down like straw in the urine of a manure pit. 11He'll subdue Moab like a swimmer pushes down water. He'll end its pride and slight-of-hand. 12He'll bring down its impregnable fortifications and throw them on the ground.</span>
