## Isaiah Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But there won't be any more darkness for those who have been in distress. In earlier times, God didn't give much prominence to the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, but at a future time he'll make it glorious along the road from the Jordan along the Sea of Galilee, Galilee of the Gentiles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Those who walk in deep darkness</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You'll enlarge the nation</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You'll take off their yoke of slavery,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Infantry boots from the chaos of battle</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A child has been born to us, a son has been given;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> His peaceful rule will never end</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The LORD is issuing a message against Jacob,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Everyone in Ephraim will find out,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But the LORD will bring adversaries from Rezin</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Syrians from the east plus Philistines from the west</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yet the people still won't come back</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So he'll cut off head and tail from Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The head is the elders and honored men;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The people's guides are misguiding them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> That's why the LORD doesn't delight in their young men</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Sin burns here like a brush fire,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The fury of the LORD of Hosts will burn through the land;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They'll grab what's on the right hand,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Ephraim and Manasseh will devour each other</span>
