## Isaiah Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Moab Moab will be ruined because Ar and Kir will be wiped out overnight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The people of Dibon will go up to their temple and high places to weep. Moab will mourn over Nebo and Medeba; everyone’s head will be bald, and their beard shaved off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They’ll put on burlap in the streets and squares and on the housetops. Everyone will be wailing, melting in tears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The outcries of Heshbon and Elealeh will echo all the way to Jahaz; the armed men of Moab will cry out in panic; their souls will tremble inside them.	<strong>Is</strong><strong> 15:1-4</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>My heart weeps for Moab; its refugees are fleeing as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah; they’re going up to Luhith sobbing. All along the road to Horonaim, they’re crying out in distress over their ruin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The water at Nimrim has dried up; the tender grass has withered; there’s nothing green anywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The abundance they stored up is being carried away across Wadi Arabim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Their distress cry has gone all over Moab; their wail as far as Eglaim and Beer-elim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The stream near Dibon is running red with blood; I’ll bring yet more anguish on Dibon: a lion on the refugees from Moab and the remnant <em>that’s still </em>in the land.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 15:5-9</strong></span>
