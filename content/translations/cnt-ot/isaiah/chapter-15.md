## Isaiah Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Moab Moab will be ruined because Ar and Kir will be wiped out overnight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The people of Dibon will go up to their temple and high places to weep. Moab will mourn over Nebo and Medeba; everyone’s head will be bald, and their beard shaved off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They’ll put on burlap in the streets and squares and on the housetops. Everyone will be wailing, melting in tears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The outcries of Heshbon and Elealeh will echo all the way to Jahaz; the armed men of Moab will cry out in panic; their souls will tremble inside them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 15:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My heart weeps for Moab; its refugees are fleeing as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah; they’re going up to Luhith sobbing. All along the road to Horonaim, they’re crying out in distress over their ruin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The water at Nimrim has dried up; the tender grass has withered; there’s nothing green anywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The abundance they stored up is being carried away across Wadi Arabim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Their distress cry has gone all over Moab; their wail as far as Eglaim and Beer-elim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The stream near Dibon is running red with blood; I’ll bring yet more anguish on Dibon: a lion on the refugees from Moab and the remnant <em>that’s still </em>in the land.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 15:5-9</p>
