## Isaiah Chapter 33

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits you, destroyers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> LORD, be gracious to us; we've waited for you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let people run from the turmoil you bring;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Gather spoil like caterpillars gather</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Honor the LORD because he lives on high;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Later he'll provide you stability,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But for now, your brave men cry in public;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The roads are empty; travel is at a standstill</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The land mourns and pines away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll burn the nations to lime</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You that are far off, pay attention to what I've done;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Sinners in Zion have panicked; the godless tremble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You that conduct yourselves justly and speak truthfully,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You'll see the King in his splendor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You'll remember your fears from before, and ask,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You won't see those fierce people anymore</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Look at Zion that hosts your appointed festivals;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The LORD, the Majestic One, will be there for you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Your enemies' tackle is hanging loose;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You that live here won't say, "We're weak and sick,"</span>
