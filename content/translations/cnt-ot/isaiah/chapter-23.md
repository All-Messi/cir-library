## Isaiah Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Tyre</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Be quiet, you people on the coast, merchants of Sidon;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But now be disgraced, Sidon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When the report reaches Egypt,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pass the news on to Tarshish;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Is this your joyous city</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Who planned this against Tyre, the granter of crowns,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The LORD of Hosts planned it to dampen the pride of all beauty,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Tyre's land has been flooded like the Nile, Tarshish;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He said, "You won't celebrate anymore,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Look at the land of the Babylonians; it's gone. The Assyrians delivered it to the desert animals; they erected siege ramps, stripped its palaces, and reduced it to ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Wail, ships of Tarshish;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Tyre will pass from memory for 70 years, the lifetime of one king. Then it will come back to life like the woman in "The Song of the Prostitute":</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> After 70 years the LORD will revisit Tyre. It'll go back to playing the prostitute with kingdoms everywhere. 18In the end, her pay won't be saved up or hoarded; it will be set aside to feed and dress the LORD's priests.</span>
