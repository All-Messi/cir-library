## Isaiah Chapter 48

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to this, Jacob called 'Israel,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I know how stubborn you are,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I made my prediction long ago</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They're not things from long ago;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I know what traitors you are;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yet for my name's sake, I've delayed expressing my anger;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I've refined you, but not like silver;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> For my own sake—yes, I'll do it for my own sake—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'm the One that founded the earth</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Come here, all of you, and listen!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> There I've said it; I've called him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Come close and listen:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> This is what the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> If only you'd paid attention to what I told you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Your descendants would have been too numerous to count,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They weren't thirsty while he led them through the desert;</span>
