## Isaiah Chapter 61

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; he’s anointed me to bring good news to the downtrodden. He’s sent me to bandage up the brokenhearted, to liberate captives, to free prisoners,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to announce that this is the year the LORD shows blessing, the day he sets things right, to comfort anyone that’s grieving,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>to give to the sad in Zion a crown in place of ashes, the oil of happiness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise rather than a fainting spirit so they’ll be like Terebinths of Goodness the LORD has planted to demonstrate his glory.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 61:1-3</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then they’ll rebuild the ancient ruins, set back up what was torn down, repair destroyed towns deserted for generations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Foreigners will pasture your flocks, do your farming, and tend your vineyards.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But you’ll be the LORD’s priests; people will speak of you as his ministers. You’ll feed on the wealth of nations and take pride in their prosperity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Instead of humiliation you’ll have a double portion; rather than dishonor you’ll celebrate over your lot. You’ll have everlasting joy in your land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> the nations will honor your offspring </em><em>worldwide</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>	e</em><em>veryone will recognize you</em><em> </em><em>as the offspring the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> blessed.”</em><strong>	</strong> <strong>Is</strong><strong> 61:4-9</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>I’m really happy in the LORD; I celebrate over my God because he’s dressed me in salvation and wrapped me in goodness like a robe, like a groom dresses himself in a garland, and a bride adorns herself with jewels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>As the ground produces seeds and a garden makes sprouts grow, so the Lord GOD makes goodness and praise spring up for all the world to see.</span>
