## Isaiah Chapter **26**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>At that time, they’ll sing a song in Judah: We have an impregnable city; it’s set up with secure walls and ramparts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Open the gates so a good nation can enter, one that stays faithful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You keep steadfast minds in perfect peace because they trust in you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Trust in the LORD forever because in him we have an everlasting Rock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He brings down low the ones that live up high in their “safe city”; <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong>he throws it to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The poor and helpless trample it.<strong>	</strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 26:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The road for the righteous is not rough; Righteous One, level out our path.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>We conform our way to your judgments, LORD; with all our heart we want to honor you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>At night I long for you; my spirit looks for you earnestly; when the earth experiences your judgments, its people learn goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Even if sinners receive grace, they don’t learn goodness; they keep dealing unjustly in an unjust land and don’t sense the LORD’s majesty. <strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 26:7-10</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>LORD, you’re holding up your fist, but they don’t see it; show them your zeal for your people; humble your adversaries; consume them with fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You’ll establish peace for us, since you’re the One that <em>actually </em>does for us everything we <em>try to </em>do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Other lords have ruled us before, but you’re the only one we acknowledge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Those dead <em>rulers</em> won’t live <em>again</em>; their departed spirits won’t rise. You’ve punished them with destruction, and wiped out any memory of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You’ve made this nation great and extended its borders; we honor you.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 26:11-15</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>We looked to you in distress, able only to whisper a prayer, because you were disciplining us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Like a pregnant woman at delivery time, she writhes and cries out in labor pains; that’s how we were before you, LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>We’ve been pregnant, writhing in labor, but nothing came of it; we couldn’t save the world or bring life into it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But <em>even </em>your dead will live again; their corpses will rise; those who lie in the dust will wake up and sing for joy. Your light will fall on them like dew, and the ground will give birth to their departed spirits. <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 26:16-19</strong> <strong>Deliverance for Israel</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Go home, my people, and lock the doors behind you; hide for a while till <em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em> anger has run its course.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The LORD is coming from heaven to punish people for their sin; the ground will show those whose blood’s been shed; it won’t any longer <em>be able to </em>hide its slain.<strong>	</strong></span>
