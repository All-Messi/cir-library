## Isaiah Chapter 66

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I made all this;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll carry out their punishments</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Listen to this message from the LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The uproar in the city and the Temple</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Who ever heard of such a thing?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Would I bring to term and not deliver?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Be joyful over Jerusalem, you that love her;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> This is what the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll comfort you like a mother does;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When you experience it, you'll be happy;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He will come in fire;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He'll condemn by fire and sword; 17"Those who 'sanctify and purify' themselves to enter sacred gardens with idols in the center, that eat pig meat and disgusting things like mice, will all come to their end at the same time. 18I know what they're thinking; I can see what they're doing. The time's coming to gather all nations to see my glory. 19I'll perform a sign among them and send survivors out from them to the nations—to Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, Javan, and distant lands that have never heard of me. 20From all the countries they'll bring me your people as a grain offering. On horses, mules, and camels; in chariots and litter wagons they'll bring them to my holy mountain Jerusalem," 	the LORD says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> As surely as the new earth and sky will last,</span>
