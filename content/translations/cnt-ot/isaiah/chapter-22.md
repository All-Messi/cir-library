## Isaiah Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About the Valley of Vision</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You noisy, exuberant city in an uproar,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Your rulers all fled together</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> So I said, "Leave me alone to weep bitterly;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The Lord GOD of Hosts has in mind</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Elam will take up the quiver</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Chariots will fill your beautiful valleys;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> God will take down Judah's defenses.	Is 22:4-8a</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Lord GOD of Hosts had called for you to weep, wail, shave your head, and put on burlap. 13Instead, you've celebrated with revelry, butchering cattle and sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: "Let's eat and drink; tomorrow we die." 14The LORD of Hosts revealed this to me, "I won't forgive that sin as long as you live."  	Is 22:8b-14</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Lord GOD of Hosts says, "Go ask Shebna, the palace administrator, 16'Who are you that you've hewn out a monumental tomb for yourself here high in the rock? 17-19Arrogant man! I'm going to depose you from your office, wad you into a ball, and throw you away into a large country to die there with your splendid chariots, you disgrace to your master's house. 20-21I'll put your robe on my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah and tie your sash around him. I'll entrust him with your authority, and he'll become a father to the people in Judah and Jerusalem. 22I'll hang on his shoulder the key to David's house. When he opens, no one will shut; when he shuts, nobody will open. 23I'll drive him like a stake in solid ground. He'll become famous, 24and they'll place on him the prestige of his family, from offspring and issue to the least items of bowls and jars. 25But then the peg driven in solid ground will break off, and the load hanging on it will fall to the ground. I, the LORD, have said so.'"</span>
