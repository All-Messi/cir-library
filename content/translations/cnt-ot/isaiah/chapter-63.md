## Isaiah Chapter 63

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Who is this that's coming from Edom</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Why are your clothes stained red</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I've had a day for payback on my mind;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But I looked, amazed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I tramped down nations in my fury</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll recount the praises and tell about Yahveh's enduring love</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said, "They're my people,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In all their adversity he felt their suffering;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But they did rebel and grieve his Holy Spirit;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then his people remembered the past at Moses' time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Look down from heaven,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Even if Abraham would disown us</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> LORD, why let us stray from your ways</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Your holy people had your sanctuary for a while,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> We've become like a nation you never ruled,</span>
