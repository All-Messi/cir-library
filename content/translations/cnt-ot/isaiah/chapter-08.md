## Isaiah Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the LORD told me, <em>“Take a large tablet and </em><em>etch</em><em> on it in</em><em> standard</em><em> letters</em><em> ‘</em><em>Maher</em>-<em>shalal</em>-<em>hash</em>-<em>baz</em><em>’</em> [quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil].<em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I got reputable men to witness it: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So I had relations with <em>my wife </em>the prophetess, and she had a son. The LORD told me, <em>“Name him </em><em>Maher-shalal-hash-baz</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>because</em><em> before he knows how to say ‘daddy’ or ‘mommy,’ the king of Assyria will ‘carry away the wealth’ in Damascus and ‘the spoil’ in Samaria.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD spoke to me again,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><em>Devise</em><em> a battle plan, it’ll be </em><em>thwarted;</em> <em>	</em><em>	develop a strategy, it won’t stand,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because ‘God is with us’ </em>[Immanuel].<em>”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 8:9-10</strong> <strong>Trust the L</strong><strong>ORD</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD warned me strictly not to think the way this country thinks:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Preserve the testimony; entrust the teaching to my disciples. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>I’ll wait for the LORD that’s turned away from Jacob’s descendants. I’ll diligently depend on him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I and the children the LORD has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from the LORD of Hosts, who lives on Mount Zion.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 8:11-18</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> If they tell you to consult mediums and wizards that chirp and mutter, shouldn’t they consult their God instead? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Instead, go to <em>God’s</em> teaching, go to his testimony! If what they say doesn’t agree with that, it’s because they’re not going to see a new dawn. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They’ll pass through the land, distressed and hungry. They’ll get mad and curse their king and their God. They’ll look up to the sky <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and down at the earth at distress and darkness, at the despair that comes from anguish. Then they’ll be thrust into deep<em> </em>darkness.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 8:19-22</strong> <strong>A </strong><strong>Messiah</strong><strong> Has Been Born to Us</strong></span>
