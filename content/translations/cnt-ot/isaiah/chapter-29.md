## Isaiah Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits you, Ariel, city where David camped!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yet I'll bring disaster on you, Ariel;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll camp against you all the way around</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You'll be brought low;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD of Hosts will visit you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The nations that carry on war with you, Ariel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They'll be like hungry people that dream they're eating,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But you linger and wait and blind yourselves. 11-12This whole vision won't mean much to you, either because it's a sealed scroll to you or because you can't read. Literate or not, you won't get it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So I'll surprise these hypocrites once again</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You've got things turned around!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Isn't it just a little while</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> At that time, the deaf will hear the message from the scroll;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Ruthless people will come to nothing;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So the LORD that redeemed Abraham says of Jacob's house,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> When they see their descendants around them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The ignorant will know the truth;</span>
