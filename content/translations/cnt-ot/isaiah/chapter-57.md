<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Good people perish and nobody notices;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They who take the godly road</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who are you making fun of?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your destiny is among those smooth-stone fertility symbols</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You've committed adultery on every high mountain</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You've put pagan symbols on the back of your doors</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You've gone to Molech with olive oil</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You've worn yourselves out by your long search,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll tell everybody about your so-called good deeds,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When you appealed for help,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> God says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> This is what the high and lofty One says</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I won't oppose you forever or always be angry;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I was angry and struck them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I've seen their ways, but I'll heal them anyway;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> There's no peace for them," my God says.</span>
