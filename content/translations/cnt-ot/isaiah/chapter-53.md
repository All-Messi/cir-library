## Isaiah Chapter 53

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Who has believed our message?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He wasn't particularly handsome or noble</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> People despised and abandoned him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Actually though, he was shouldering our weaknesses</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But he was pierced for our sins,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We've all wandered off like sheep</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He was oppressed and suffering,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He was taken away by oppression and condemnation;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They assigned his grave with criminals</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But it was the LORD's plan to crush him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He'll see what results from his anguish and feel fulfilled;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So God will assign him a place among the great,</span>
