## Isaiah Chapter 53

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Who has believed our message? Who has the LORD shown his arm to? He grew up before <em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em> like a tender sprout, like a shoot out of parched ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He wasn’t particularly handsome or noble to draw our attention to him or have the looks that would attract us to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>People despised and abandoned him, a pained man, acquainted with grief; like someone people look the other way from, we looked down on him and didn’t respect him.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is 53:1-3</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Actually though, he was shouldering <u>our</u> weaknesses and carrying our pains, but we considered him someone God struck and made suffer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But he was pierced for <u>our</u> sins, crushed for our iniquities. The discipline that was for our welfare fell on him, and by his scourging we are healed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>We’ve all wandered off like sheep and turned to our own way; but the LORD laid on him the sinfulness of us all.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is 53:4-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He was oppressed and suffering, but he didn’t say anything; like a lamb they led to slaughter or a sheep silent before its shearers, he didn’t open his mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He was taken away by oppression and condemnation; who realized at the time that he was being cut off from the living for the sins of my people, who deserved the stroke?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They assigned his grave with criminals though he hadn’t deceived or been violent; yet he was <em>associated </em>with a rich man in his death.	<strong>Is</strong><strong> 53:7-9</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>But it was the LORD’s plan to crush him, to put him to grief; when he offers himself as a guilt offering, he’ll see his offspring and extend his life, and the LORD will accomplish his good pleasure in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He’ll see what results from his anguish and feel fulfilled; by his experience, my servant the upright one, will justify many by shouldering their sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So <em>God </em>will assign him a place among the great, and he’ll divide the spoil with the strong because he poured out his life when they treated him like a transgressor. But he was shouldering many <em>other </em>people’s sins and interceding for them.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is 53:10-12</strong> <strong>The Future Glory for Zion</strong></span>
