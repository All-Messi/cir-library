## Isaiah Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My Servant that I uphold,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He won't holler or be boisterous;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He won't break a bruised reed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He won't falter or lose heart;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God, Yahveh, says—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'm Yahveh; that's my name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> My former prophecies have already happened;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Sing a new song to Yahveh;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let the desert towns join the chorus,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Let them honor Yahveh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He will rush out like a soldier</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll make mountains and hills desolate</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll lead the blind on a new road,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll drive back and completely disgrace</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Who is as blind as my servant,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You look at many things, but don't see;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Because he's good, Yahveh was pleased</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But his people have been robbed and plundered,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Who among you will learn from the past?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Who gave Jacob up for spoil and Israel to plunderers?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> So he poured out his hot anger on you in fierce warfare</span>
