## Isaiah Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high throne, and his train filled the Temple. 2Seraphs hovered above him, each with six wings:  two covered their faces, two covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3One shouted to the other,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The thresholds shook when he shouted, and smoke filled the Temple. 5I said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> One seraph flew to me with a burning coal he'd taken off the altar with tongs. 7He touched my mouth with it and said, "That has taken away your guilt; your sin's forgiven."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then I heard the Lord say, "Who will I send? Who'll go for us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Harden your hearts,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I said, "How long, Lord?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A tenth of it will survive</span>
