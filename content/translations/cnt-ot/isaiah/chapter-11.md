## Isaiah Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A sapling will grow out of Jesse's stump;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD's spirit will rest on him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He'll delight in respecting the LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He'll judge the poor justly</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Faithfulness will be his cloak;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Wolves will live with lambs;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Cows will graze beside bears;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A nursing baby will play by a cobra pit;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Nothing will do harm anywhere on my holy mountain,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> At that time, Jesse's heir will serve as a banner for the Gentiles. They'll rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. 11For a second time he'll recover the remnant of his people that are left in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Nubia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and islands in the sea. 12He'll hoist a flag for the nations and repatriate the exiles of Israel and Judah from every direction. 13Ephraim and Judah won't resent each other or harass one another. 14They'll swoop down on the Philistines in the west and together plunder the nations to the east. They'll control Edom and Moab, and subjugate the Ammonites. 15The LORD will dry up the Red Sea by Egypt and blow his scorching wind on the Euphrates River. He'll separate it into seven channels so people can wade across in sandals. 16There'll be a highway from Assyria for the remnant to return on, like there was for Israel when he brought them out of Egypt.</span>
