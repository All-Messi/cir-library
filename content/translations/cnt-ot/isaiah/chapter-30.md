## Isaiah Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD says, "Misfortune awaits rebellious children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The safety that comes from Pharaoh will humiliate them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Their princes may be at Zoan,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Oracle About Animals in the Negev</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Go write this on a scroll</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> This is a rebellious nation,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Get off the road, turn away from the beaten path;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> This is what the Holy One of Israel says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> It will fall like a smashed clay pot</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> This is what the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You said, 'No, we'll flee on horses brought from Egypt.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A thousand will flee at the threat of one;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The LORD wants to be gracious to you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> People in Zion, residents of Jerusalem, don't cry; he'll be gracious to you. When he hears you cry out to him for help, he'll answer. 20Although he's given you adversity for food and suffering for water, your Teacher won't hide any longer; you'll see him. 21When you swerve to left or right, you'll hear a voice behind you, "This is the way; walk here." 22You'll defile your carved images overlaid with silver, your molten images plated with gold. You'll thrown them out like filthy rags and say, "Get them out of here!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Then he'll give you rain for the seed you sow and bread from the yield. It'll be rich and abundant. Your livestock will have plenty of pasture. 24Your oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder winnowed with fork and shovel. 25After the great slaughter of your enemies when the towers fall, on every tall mountain and tall hill, there'll be streams of water running down. 26Moonlight will be like sunlight, and sunlight will be seven times brighter—a week's worth a day—when the LORD sets his people's fractures and heals the bruises he's inflicted on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The LORD will come from a remote place</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But you'll sing songs at night like you do at the holy festivals. You'll celebrate like you do when you march to a flute as pilgrims and go up to the mountain of the LORD, the Rock of Israel. 30He will make his majestic voice heard and bring down his arm in lightning, cloudbursts, and downpours with hailstones. 31The Assyrians will panic when they hear him strike with his rod. 32Every punishing blow he lays on them will be to the accompaniment of tambourines and harps. He'll fight them in battles and brandish his weapons. 33Topheth has long been ready, prepared for the Assyrian king. The LORD has made it deep and wide, a pyre with plenty of wood. His breath like a lava stream of sulfur will light it.</span>
