## Isaiah Chapter 38

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Around that time, Hezekiah got deathly ill, and Isaiah came to tell him, "The LORD says to set your house in order; you're going to die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Hezekiah turned to the wall and prayed, 3"LORD, please remember how I've followed you honestly with all my heart and done what you consider good." He cried bitterly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then a message from the LORD came to Isaiah: 5"Go back and tell Hezekiah that the LORD God of your ancestor David says, 'I've heard your prayer and seen your tears. I'll give you 15 more years to live 6and deliver you and this city from the king of Assyria. 7This is the sign that I'll do what I've said: 8I'll make the shadow on Ahaz's stairway go back up 10 steps.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A Writing by Hezekiah, King of Judah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I wouldn't see the LORD again while I was alive</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Where I live was being blown away</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I called out for help all night;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I chattered like a swallow and a crane</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> LORD, people gain life by hard experiences;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> My deep anguish was for my own good;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Sheol doesn't thank you; death doesn't praise you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Only the living can thank you, as I do today;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The LORD will surely save me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Isaiah had said, "Apply fig salve to the boil so he can recover." 22Hezekiah had asked, "What's the sign that I'll go up to the LORD's Temple?"</span>
