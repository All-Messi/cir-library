## Isaiah Chapter 37

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and went to the Temple. 2He sent Eliakim, Shebna, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah. 3They went to him and said, "Hezekiah says, 'This is a distressing, discouraging, dejecting day. Babies have come due, but there's no strength to deliver them. 4Maybe the LORD your God has heard the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria sent to mock the living God. Maybe he'll reprove him for it. Pray for the remnant that's left.'" [5]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Isaiah said, "Tell your master the LORD says, 'You don't need to be afraid of what the Assyrian king's messengers have blasphemed. 7I'll make him believe a rumor and go back home. He'll fall by the sword there.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Meantime, the Rabshakeh went back and found the king of Assyria fighting Libnah, because he'd heard he'd left Lachish. 9The king had heard that Tirhakah [Taharqa], king of Nubia, had set out to fight him. When the Rabshakeh heard it, he sent ambassadors back to Hezekiah: 10"Don't let the god you trust in deceive you into thinking Jerusalem won't fall. 11You've heard that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries. Are you going to be spared? 12Did their gods deliver Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, the Edenites in Telassar? 13Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Hena, Ivvah, or the city of Sepharvaim?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Hezekiah read the letter, then went up to the Temple and unrolled it in the LORD's presence. 15He prayed, 16"LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubs, you alone are God over the kingdoms. You made earth and sky. 17Incline your ear and hear, open your eyes and see. Listen to what Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God. 18Assyria's kings have devastated all the nations and their lands. 19They've thrown their gods into the fire because they were just hand-made pieces of wood and stone. 20But now, LORD our God, deliver us from the one that destroyed those kingdoms so the world can know that you alone are God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Isaiah sent word to Hezekiah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I have this to say to him:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You mocked the Lord through your messengers:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I've dug wells and refreshed myself with their water</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> That's why the people in them are</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I know when you sit down,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Because you raged at me 30"Hezekiah, I'll show you what I mean: this year you'll only eat what volunteers, next year what volunteers from that, but the third year you'll sow and harvest, tend vineyards and eat their fruit. 31The surviving remnant of the siege in Judah will again take root down and bear fruit up. 32A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will make it happen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The LORD says, "The king of Assyria and his army won't come into this city or shoot an arrow here. He won't approach it with a shield or throw a mound up against its walls. 34He'll go back home the way he came. 35I'll save this city for my sake and my servant David."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The angel of the LORD went out that night and struck 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up early the next morning, the Assyrians were all dead. 37So Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 38As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrock, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him.</span>
