## Numbers Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On the first day, second month, second year after they left Egypt, the LORD told Moses at Sinai in the Tent of Meeting, 2"Take a census by families. Count the men 320 years old and up that can go to war. You and Aaron count them by armies. 4To help you, appoint one man from each tribe as head of his ancestor's house. 5They'll stand with you:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Those are the appointed leaders by tribes, the heads of clans in Israel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Moses and Aaron took the men God had designated 18and gathered the community on the first day, second month. [19]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The count came out as follows:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> They didn't count the Levites in the military census. 48The LORD told Moses, 49"Don't count the Levites. 50Put them in charge of the Tabernacle and everything associated with it. They'll transport it and its furnishings, take care of it, and camp around it. 51When it sets out, they'll dismantle it. When it camps, they'll assemble it. Execute any layman that comes near. 52The Israelites will camp in groups by their standard in their armies. 53But the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle so there won't be any wrath on the Israelites. [54a]</span>
