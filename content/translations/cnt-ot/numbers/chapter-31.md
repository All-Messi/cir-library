<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Moses told the people, “<em>Arm men to attack Midian and carry out the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> revenge on </em><em>it</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Send </em><em>1,000</em><em> men from each tribe.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They provided 12,000 men. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Moses sent them to war with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest along with the holy items from the sanctuary and bugles for signaling. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They fought Midian and killed every male, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>including its five kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, Reba. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with a sword. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They took the women and children, their cattle, flocks, and possessions. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They burned their towns, houses, and camps; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and took the spoil—people and animals. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They brought the captives, prey, and spoil to Moses, Eleazar, and the community on the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.</span>

You’ll be ceremonially clean then,</em><em> and you can come in</em><em>to</em><em> the camp.”</em><em>	 </em><strong>Num 31:13-24</strong><em>   </em></span>
