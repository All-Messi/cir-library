## Numbers Chapter 36

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The heads of clans came down from Gilead (son of Machir son of Manasseh son of Joseph) to Moses and Israel's leaders. 2They said, "The LORD told you to allot land to Israel for inheritance, and to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our relative to his daughters. 3But if they marry outside their tribe, their inheritance will move to the new tribe. 4When Israel's Year of Jubilee comes, it will become permanent in the new tribe and lost from ours."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So from the LORD Moses said, "Joseph's descendants are raising a legitimate issue. 6Do this: the daughters of Zelophehad can marry anyone in their father's tribe. 7Inheritance can't move from tribe to tribe. 8Every daughter that inherits must marry in her tribe. 9Each tribe will retain its inheritance."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> That's what the daughters of Zelophehad did. 11Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah married their uncles' sons; 12and their inheritance stayed in their father's tribe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD gave those commandments to Israel through Moses in the Plain of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.</span>
