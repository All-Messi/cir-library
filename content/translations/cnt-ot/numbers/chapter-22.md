## Numbers Chapter 22

### Balak Summons Balaam

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel traveled and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Balak son of Zippor saw what Israel did to the Amorites. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The people of Moab were afraid of them because there were so many of them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The king of Moab told the elders in Midian, <em>“This horde will eat</em><em> up everything around us like an ox </em><em>eats up grass in a pasture</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>Balak, king of Moab at the time, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, near the River <em>Euphrates</em> in the land of his people. He called him and said, <em>“A people </em><em>has co</em><em>me out </em><em>of Egypt. They cover the ground;</em><em> they’re living across from me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>C</em><em>ome and </em><em>put a </em><em>curse </em><em>on </em><em>them</em><em>;</em><em> there are too many of them for me to fight.</em><em> </em><em>Maybe I can defeat them and drive them out.</em><em> </em><em>I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 22:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The elders in Moab and Midian left with a <em>fee</em> for fortunetelling in hand and went to Balaam with Balak’s message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said, <em>“Spend the night here, and I’ll bring word back to you as the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>tells </em><em>me.”</em> So they stayed with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> God came to Balaam, <em>“Who are these men?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“Balak </em><em>son of </em><em>Zippor sent me a </em>message<em>, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>‘</em><em>A people has come out of Egypt and cover</em><em>ed</em><em> the land.</em><em> Come</em><em> </em><em>put a </em><em>curse</em><em> on </em><em>them for me.</em><em> </em><em>Maybe I can fight them and drive them out.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“Don’t go with them.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t curse the people because they’re blessed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Balaam got up in the morning and told Balak’s leaders, <em>“Go back</em><em>. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has refused to let me go with you.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 22:7-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They went back to Balak, <em>“Balaam wouldn’t come with us.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Balak sent a bigger group of more distinguished officials,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“Balak says, ‘</em><em>Please</em><em> </em><em>don’t let anything</em><em> keep you from coming to me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I’ll honor you richly and do whatever you tell me.</em><em> Come</em><em> </em><em>put a </em><em>curse </em><em>on </em><em>this </em><em>nation</em><em> for me.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Balaam said, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>“Though Balak g</em><em>ives</em><em> me his house full of silver and gold, I couldn’t do anything great or small that’s contrary to </em><em>what</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> my God</em><em> says</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>St</em><em>ay here tonight, and I’ll find out what else the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>may</em><em> </em><em>say</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> God came to him at night, <em>“If</em><em> the me</em><em>n have come to call you, go </em><em>ahead </em><em>with them; but only </em><em>do </em><em>what I tell you.”</span>

### Balaam and His Donkey


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with them. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to hinder him. He was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When the donkey saw the angel standing there with his sword drawn, she went off the road into a field, but Balaam hit her to get her back on the road. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Then the angel stood in a narrow path between vineyards with a wall on both sides. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When the donkey saw the angel, she pressed herself to the wall and mashed Balaam’s foot; so he hit her again. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The angel went on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn either way. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>When the donkey saw the angel, she lay down under Balaam. He was mad and hit her with his stick.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 22:21-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The LORD opened her mouth, and she asked, <em>“What have I done to you </em><em>to</em><em> hit me three times?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Balaam said, <em>“Y</em><em>ou’ve </em><em>mocked</em><em> m</em><em>e! If I’d had a sword, I would’ve killed you!</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The donkey said, <em>“Am I not </em><em>the</em><em> donkey you’ve ridden </em><em>all </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em>life?</em><em> </em><em>Have I </em><em>ever</em><em> ac</em><em>ted</em><em> like this </em><em>before</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel standing on the road with his sword drawn, and he bowed to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The angel said, <em>“Why </em><em>did</em><em> you hit your donkey three times?</em><em> </em><em>I’ve come </em><em>to restrain you, because you’re opposing</em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>But the donkey saw me and turned aside three times.</em><em> </em><em>If she hadn’t</em><em>, I would’</em><em>ve killed you and let her live.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Balaam said, <em>“I’ve sinned.</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em> didn’t know you were standing on the road</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>If you</em><em> want me to</em><em>, I’ll turn </em><em>around</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> But the angel said, <em>“Go </em><em>on </em><em>with the men, but only say what I tell you.”</em><em> </em> So Balaam went along with them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 22:28-35</p>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> When Balak heard Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab on the Arnon border. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Did</em><em>n’t</em><em> I urgently call you?</em><em> </em><em>Why didn’t you come?</em><em> </em><em>Am I really not able to honor you</em>?” <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Balaam said, <em>“I’</em><em>m here</em><em>!</em><em> Can I say </em>just <em>anything</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>I’ll say what God </em><em>tells me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong>He went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent <em>some</em> to Balaam and the leaders that were with him. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>In the morning he took Balaam to the high places of Baal to see part of the people from there.</span>
