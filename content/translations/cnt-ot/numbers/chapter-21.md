## Numbers Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by way of Atharim, he fought Israel and took some captives. 2Israel vowed to the LORD, "If you'll deliver them to me, we'll destroy their towns." 3He delivered them, and they "destroyed" them and their towns; the name of the place became Hormah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then they set out from Mount Hor by taking the road to the Red Sea, to go around Edom, and the people got impatient because of the journey. 5They criticized God and Moses, "Why bring us out of Egypt to die in the desert? There's no food or water. We hate this miserable food!" 6The LORD sent poisonous snakes among them. They bit the people and a lot of them died. 7They came to Moses, "We've sinned; we've criticized you and the LORD. Intercede with him so he'll take the snakes away." Moses did that, 8and the LORD told him, "Fashion a poisonous snake on a standard so everybody that looks at it will survive." 9Moses did that.  If a snake bit anyone and they looked at the bronze serpent, they'd survive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The Israelites moved out and camped in Oboth, 11 from there to Iyeabarim in the desert east of Moab, 12from there to Wadi Zered, 13and then to the other side of the Arnon in the desert that comes out of the border of the Amorite. The Arnon forms the border between Moab and the Amorites. 14 The Book of the Wars of the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> From there they continued to Beer. That's the "well" where the LORD told Moses, "Gather the people so I can give them water."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then Israel sang this song:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The well that the leaders sank, From the desert they continued to Mattanah, 19to Nahaliel, to Bamoth, 20to the valley in Moab, at the top of Pisgah, which overlooks Jeshimon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Israel sent ambassadors to Sihon, king of the Amorites, 22"Let me go through your land. We won't turn off into fields or vineyards, or drink water from your wells. We'll go by the King's Highway till we've passed through."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But Sihon wouldn't let them. He gathered his army and attacked Israel in the Wilderness at Jahaz. 24Israel struck him with the sword and took his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites. Jazer was the border of Ammon. 25Israel took those towns and lived in them, in Heshbon and its surrounding villages. 26Heshbon was Sihon's city, who had fought the former king of Moab and took his land as far as the Arnon. 27The ones that recite proverbs say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> A fire went out from Heshbon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Misfortune awaits you, Moab!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> But we've thrown them down;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> So Israel lived in the territory of the Amorites. 32Moses sent men to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and expelled the Amorites there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og, king of Bashan, went out with his people to fight at Edrei. 34But the LORD told Moses, "Don't be afraid of him. I'll give him, his people, and his land to you. Do to him what you did to Sihon." 35So they killed him, his sons, and his people till there wasn't a remnant left. They took over his land.</span>
