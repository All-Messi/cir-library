## Numbers Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he didn't go like before to look for omens, but faced the open country. 2He saw Israel camping by tribes, and God's Spirit came on him. 3He took up this oracle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Water will flow from Jacob's buckets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> God is bringing him out of Egypt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Israel lies down like a lion;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Balak was mad at Balaam. He clapped his hands, and said, "I called you to curse my enemies, and you've persisted in blessing them three times! 11Go back home. I said I'd greatly honor you, but the LORD has prevented you from receiving your honor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Balaam said, "Didn't I tell your messengers, 13'Though Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, on my own I can't do anything contrary to the LORD's command, good or bad. I'll say what he says.'? 14I'm going to my people, but I'll advise you what this nation will do to your people later."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He took up this oracle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Edom will be a possession;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> A ruler will arise from Jacob</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He looked at Amalek and took up this oracle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He looked at the Kenites and took up this oracle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Nevertheless, Kain will be consumed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He took up his oracle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But ships will come from the coast of Kittim</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Balaam went home and Balak left.</span>
