## Numbers Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The community cried out loud that night 2and complained to Moses and Aaron, "We should've died in Egypt! We should've died in the desert! 3Why is the LORD taking us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and little ones will become spoils of war. Wouldn't we be better off to go back to Egypt?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They said to one another, "Let's appoint a leader and go back."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in front of the assembly. 6Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh tore their clothes 7and told them, "The land we passed through is really good land. 8If the LORD is pleased with us, he'll take us in and give it to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 9Don't rebel against him or be afraid of them; they'll be our prey. Their protection has been removed, and the LORD is with us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But the community said to stone them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the Tent of Meeting to the Israelites, 11and he told Moses, "How long will these people spurn me? How long will they not trust me despite all the signs I've performed among them? 12I'll hit them with a plague and disinherit them, and I'll make you into a nation bigger and stronger than them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But Moses told him, "The Egyptians will hear about it, because by your strength you brought these people up from among them, 14and they'll tell the people in this land. They've heard you're among the people. You're seen eye to eye while your cloud stands over them, and you lead them in a pillar of cloud in the daytime and a pillar of fire at night. 15If you kill this whole nation, the nations that have heard of your fame will say 16you couldn't take them to the land you promised them with an oath; so you killed them in the desert. 17Let your power be great like you've said, 18'You're slow to get angry, you abound in kindness, and forgive sin. But you won't by any means acquit the guilty. You visit the consequences of parents' sin on their descendants for three or four generations.' 19Pardon these people in keeping with your great kindness—like you've done from Egypt till now."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The LORD said, "I'll pardon them; 21but as I live, I'll fill the whole world with my glory. 22The people saw my glory and signs in Egypt and in the desert, but they've tested me ten times and ignored me. 23None of them that spurned me will see the land I swore to their ancestors. 24I'll take my servant Caleb in. He's had a different spirit and followed me faithfully. His descendants will take possession of it. 25The Amalekites and Canaanites live in the valleys. Turn around tomorrow and set out to the open country by the Red Sea."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 27"How long do I have to put up with this evil community and their complaints against me. 26-28Tell them, 'As I live,' the LORD says, 'as you've said what I can hear, I'll say what you can hear. 29Your corpses will fall in this desert—everyone 20 years old and up that's criticized me. 30You won't come into the land I swore to settle you in—except Caleb and Joshua. 31I'll take in the little ones you said would be prey. They'll experience the land you rejected. [32] 33Your offspring will be shepherds in the desert for 40 years. Because of your unfaithfulness, they'll suffer till your corpses lie in the desert. 34So you'll realize how displeased I am, you'll suffer for your guilt one year for every day you spied out the land. 35I've spoken, and I'll do it to this community that has united against me: you'll die in this desert." 36-37The men that got the community to criticize Moses because of their bad report, died by a plague in the LORD's presence. 38But Joshua and Caleb remained alive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When Moses told that to the people, they mourned greatly. 40But in the morning, they got up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, "Here we are. We've indeed sinned, but we'll go up to the place the LORD promised."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> But Moses said, "Why sin against his command? It won't work. 42Don't go; your enemies will strike you down. The LORD's not with you. 43The Amalekites and Canaanites will confront you, and you'll fall by the sword because you rejected him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> But they went up anyway to the ridge of the hill country. Moses and the Ark stayed in camp. 45The Amalekites and Canaanites attacked them and beat them back to Hormah.</span>
