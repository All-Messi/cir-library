## Numbers Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The day Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated its furnishings, the altar, and its utensils. 2The leaders in Israel (besides the numbered men) made an offering 3and brought it to the Tabernacle: 6 covered carts and 12 cattle, a cart for each pair of leaders and an ox for each leader. 4The LORD told Moses, 5"Accept these things for use in the Tent of Meeting. Give them to each Levite according to his service." 6Moses accepted the carts and cattle and gave them to the Levites: 72 carts and 4 cattle to Gershon's descendants to match their service, 8and 4 carts and 8 cattle to Merari's descendants to match their service—as directed by Ithamar son of Aaron. 9He didn't give any to Kohath's descendants because their service was with the holy objects, which they carried on their shoulders. 10The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; they offered it in front of the altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then the LORD told Moses, "Have them present their offering, one leader a day, for the dedication of the altar." [Each leader presented the same offering as follows:]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The first day, Nahshon son of Amminadab, from Judah, presented his offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The second day, Nethanel son of Zuar, leader of Issachar, presented his offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The third day, Eliab son of Helon, leader of Zebulun, presented.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The fourth day, Elizur son of Shedeur, leader of Reuben, presented.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The fifth day, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, leader of Simeon, presented.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The sixth day, Eliasaph son of Deuel, leader of Gad, presented.</span>

[19-23] = [25-29] = [31-35] = [37-41] = [43-47] = [49-53] = [55-59] = [61-65] = [67-71] = 84That was the dedication offering for the altar from the leaders of Israel when it was anointed: 12 silver platters, 12 silver bowls, 12 gold pans, 85each silver platter weighing 3¼ lbs 130 shekels and each bowl weighing 28 oz 70 shekels. The silver of the utensils weighed 60 lbs 2,400 shekels of the sanctuary. 86The 12 gold saucers full of incense weighed 4 oz 10 shekels apiece—3 lbs 120 shekels altogether. 87For the burnt offerings there were 12 bulls, 12 rams, 12 male lambs a year old with their grain offerings, and 12 male goats for a sin offering. 88For the peace offerings there were 24 bulls, 60 rams, 60 male goats, 60 male lambs a year old. That was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed. 89Whenever Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak to the LORD, he'd hear a voice speaking to him from between the two cherubs above the mercy seat on the Ark of Testimony.</span>
