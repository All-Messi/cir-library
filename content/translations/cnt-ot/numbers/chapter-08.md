## Numbers Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses 2to have Aaron put up the 7 lamps to shine in front of the lampstand. 3Aaron did that. 4The lampstand was hammered gold from its base to its flowers in the pattern the LORD showed Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Again the LORD told Moses, 6"Take the Levites from among the Israelites and cleanse them. 7For their cleansing, sprinkle purifying water on them, have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. 8Then have them take a bull with its grain offering—fine flour mixed with olive oil. Take a second bull for a sin offering. 9Present the Levites at the Tent of Meeting and gather the community. 10Have them put their hands on the Levites. 11Then Aaron will present the Levites to the LORD as a wave offering from the people to qualify them to perform service to the LORD. 12The Levites will put their hands on the bulls' heads. They'll offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to atone for the Levites. 13Have the Levites stand in the presence of Aaron and his sons to present them as a wave offering to the LORD. 14"In that way, set the Levites apart from among the Israelites. The Levites will belong to me. 15Then they can serve in the Tent of Meeting. But you'll cleanse them and present them as a wave offering, 16because I've dedicated them to myself in place of every firstborn in Israel. 17Every firstborn belongs to me among people and animals. The day I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I sanctified them to myself. [18] 19I've given the Levites to Aaron and his sons to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting, and to atone for them so there won't be a plague on Israel from coming near the sanctuary."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> That's what Moses, Aaron, and the community did with the Levites. 21The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Aaron presented them as a wave offering and atoned for them. 22Afterwards they went into the Tent of Meeting to perform their service with Aaron and his sons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The LORD told Moses, 24"The Levites will serve in the Tent of Meeting from age 25 to 50 25and then retire. 26They can, however, help their relatives in the Tent of Meeting in keeping an obligation, but they themselves can't work."</span>
