## Numbers Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The whole community came to the Wilderness of Zin in the first month and stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died and they buried her there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The community didn't have water and gathered against Moses and Aaron, 3"If only we'd perished when our relatives perished in the LORD's presence! 4Why bring his assembly into this desert for us and our animals to die? 5Why make us come up from Egypt to this wretched place? It's not a place with grain, figs, grapes, or pomegranates; and there's no water."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Moses and Aaron came from the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and fell on their faces. The glory of the LORD appeared to them. 7He told Moses, 8"Take the staff. You and your brother gather the community. Speak to the rock in front of them so it will yield water, and the community and their animals can drink." 9Moses took the staff, 10and he and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock. He said, "Listen, you rebels. Should we bring water out of this rock for you?" 11Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, water came out abundantly, and the community and their animals could drink. 12But the LORD told him and Aaron, "Since youpl haven't treated me as holy in front of them, you won't bring this assembly to the land I've given them." 13That was the water at Meribah, because the Israelites "quarreled" with the LORD, and he proved himself holy among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Moses sent ambassadors from Kadesh to the king of Edom. "Your relative Israel says, 'You know the hardship that has fallen to us. 15You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt and stayed there a long time, and that the Egyptians mistreated them and us. 16But when we cried out to the LORD, he sent an angel to bring us out. We're at Kadesh on the edge of your territory. 17Let us go through your land. We won't go through fields or vineyards, or even drink water from a well. We'll stay on the King's Highway till we get past your territory.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But Edom said, "No. I'll come out with swords."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Again the Israelites said, "We'll go up the highway. If any of our livestock do drink your water, we'll pay for it. Just let us walk through; it's not a big thing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But he said, "No." He came out against them with a heavy force 21and refused to let them go through; so Israel turned away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When they left Kadesh, the whole community came to Mount Hor. 23The LORD told Moses and Aaron there at the border of Edom, 24"Aaron will pass on to his people. He won't enter the land I've given Israel because youpl rebelled against my command at Meribah. 25Bring him and his son Eleazar up to Mount Hor. 26Take off his vestments and put them on Eleazar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The three of them went up on Mount Hor as the community watched. 28After Moses stripped Aaron and put his vestments on Eleazar, Aaron died. Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 29When the community saw Aaron had died, they mourned for him 30 days.</span>
