## Numbers Chapter 9

### The Second Passover

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In <strong>the first month, second year</strong> <strong>after </strong><strong><em>the Israelites</em></strong><strong> left Egypt</strong>, the LORD told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>-3</sup></strong><em>“Have Israel observe Passover </em><em>as directed</em><em> </em><em>at its scheduled time:</em><em> the fourteenth day of this month </em><em>in the evening</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Moses told the Israelites to observe it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They did so in the Wilderness of Sinai the way the LORD commanded Moses.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 9:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>Some</em> men were ceremonially unclean because of a corpse, so they couldn’t observe it that day. They came to Moses and Aaron that day, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Although we’re unclean, why can’t we present the offering to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> at the scheduled time with the rest of Israel?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Moses said, <em>“I’ll listen to what the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>say</em><em>s.”</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	    </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The day they set up the Tabernacle (the Tent of Testimony), the cloud covered it. In the evening, what looked like fire appeared over it till morning. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>That became the pattern: the cloud covered it during the day and what looked like fire covered it at night. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Whenever the cloud lifted, the Israelites would set out. Where it settled, they’d camp. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>As the LORD directed Moses, they’d set out or camp. As long as the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle, they stayed at that camp <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>even if it was for a long time. [<strong><sup>20</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>If the cloud stayed all night and lifted in the morning, they’d move out in the morning. If it stayed all day and lifted at night, they’d move out in the evening. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Whether it was two days, a month, or a year, they wouldn’t move till the cloud lifted. [<strong><sup>23</sup></strong>]</span>
