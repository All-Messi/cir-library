## Numbers Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Moses told the tribal leaders, "This is what the LORD has commanded. 2If a man makes a vow to the LORD or takes an oath that obligates him to do something, he must keep his word.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> If a woman takes a vow to the LORD and obligates herself to do something while in her father's family in her youth, 4and her father hears it and doesn't object, then her vow or pledge stands. 5But if her father forbids her, her vow or pledge doesn't stand. The LORD will release her from them because her father forbade her. 6"But, if she marries while under her vow or rash statement 7and her husband hears about it and doesn't object, then her vow or pledge stands. 8But, if he forbids her, he annuls her vow or rash statement, and the LORD will release her from it. 10"However, if she vows in her husband's house or binds herself to an obligation with an oath 11and her husband hears it, but doesn't object, then her vow or pledge stands. 12But if her husband annuls it, it won't stand, and the LORD will release her from them. 13"A husband can annul any vow or binding oath a wife submits herself to. 14If he doesn't say anything to her the day he hears it, then he confirms it. 15But if he tries to annul it later, he'll bear her guilt."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Those statutes the LORD commanded Moses about a husband and wife and a father and daughter in her youth in his home.</span>
