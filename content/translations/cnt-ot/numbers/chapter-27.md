## Numbers Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The daughters of Zelophehad son of (Hepher son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh son of) Joseph came near: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 2They stood in front of Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and said, 3"Our father died in the wilderness, but not among those who opposed the LORD with Korah. He died in his own sin and didn't have any sons. 4Why should he disappear from his clan just because he didn't have any sons? Give us a possession among our father's brothers."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Moses brought the case to the LORD.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD told him, 7"Zelophehad's daughters are right. Give them a possession among their father's brothers and transfer their father's inheritance to them. 8If a man dies without a son, transfer his inheritance to his daughter. 9If he doesn't have a daughter, give it to his brothers. 10If he doesn't have any brothers, give it to his father's brothers. 11If his father doesn't have any brothers, give it to the nearest other relative in his family. It will be an ordinance in Israel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The LORD told Moses, "Climb one of the mountains in the Abarim range and look at the land I'll give Israel. 13When you've seen it, you'll pass on to your people like Aaron did. 14In the Wilderness of Zin, during the conflict with the community, you rebelled against my command to honor me as holy in front of them at the water" (of Meribah at Kadesh).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Moses said, 16"May the LORD, the God that gives breath to all flesh, appoint a man 17to lead the community so they won't be like sheep without a shepherd."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The LORD told him, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man that has the Spirit in him, and put your hand on him. 19Have him stand in the presence of Eleazar and the community and commission him. 20Put some of your authority on him so the community can obey him. 21He'll present himself to Eleazar, who will ask the LORD for him by the Urim. At his command, he and this whole community will determine what to do."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So Moses stood Joshua in front of Eleazar and the community, 23put his hand on him, and commissioned him.</span>
