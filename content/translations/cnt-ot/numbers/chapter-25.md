## Numbers Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> While Israel was camping in Shittim, the people started carrying on prostitution with the women of Moab. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They invited the people to the sacrifices to their gods, and the people ate and bowed to their gods. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>In this way, Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the LORD was angry. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He told Moses, <em>“</em><em>Seiz</em><em>e the </em><em>ring</em><em>leaders and execute them in broad daylight in </em><em>my</em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>presence</em><em> so </em><em>my fierce anger will</em><em> turn away from Israel.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Moses told the judges, <em>“Each of you </em><em>put to death</em><em> his men that have joined </em><em>in worshiping</em><em> Baal of Peor.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em><strong>Num 25:1-5</strong></span>

He took a spear, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>followed the man into the tent, and ran both of them through, and so checked the plague on Israel. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>24,000 had died from it.</span>
