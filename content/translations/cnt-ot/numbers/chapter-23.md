## Numbers Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Balaam told Balak, "Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and rams." 2They offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 3Balaam told him, "Stand beside your burnt offering, and I'll go. Maybe the LORD will come to me, and I'll tell you what he shows me." He went to a bare hill. 4God met him, and he said, "I've set up seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each one." 5The LORD gave Balaam a message, "Go tell Balak such and such." 6He went back to Balak, who was standing by his burnt offering with the leaders of Moab.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Balaam took up this oracle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> How can I curse someone God hasn't cursed?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I see him from the top of the cliffs</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Who can count the dust of Jacob</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I told you to curse my enemies; you've blessed them!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Balak said, "Come to a different place, where you can see them—even though it'll just be the tail-end of them. Curse them for me from there." 14He took him to the Field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and ram on each one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Balaam told him, "Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet the LORD over there." 16The LORD met Balaam and gave him a message, "Go back to Balak, and say such and such." 17Balaam went to him, who was standing by his burnt offering with the officials of Moab. Balak asked, "What has the LORD said?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Balaam took up this oracle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> God does not lie like people do</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I've received a command to bless;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He hasn't observed misfortune in Jacob</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> God is bringing them out of Egypt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> There's no omen against Jacob,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> These people rise like a lioness;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Balak told him, "Don't curse them at all or bless them at all!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> But Balaam answered, "Didn't I tell you I have to do what the LORD says?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Balak said to him, "Come on; I'll take you to another place. Maybe God will agree to put a curse on them there." 28Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks Jeshimon. 29Balaam told him, "Build seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and rams." 30Balak did that and offered a bull and ram on each altar.</span>
