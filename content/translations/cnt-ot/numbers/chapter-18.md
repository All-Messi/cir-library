## Numbers Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So the LORD told Aaron, "You, your sons, and your father's family will be responsible for the sanctuary. You and your sons will be responsible for the priesthood. 2But take your relatives from the tribe of Levi to help you while you and your sons serve in the Tent of Testimony. 3They'll make preparations throughout the Tent, but they can't approach the sanctuary furnishings or the altar, or they and you will die. 4An outsider can't come near you. 5They'll tend to preparations for the sanctuary and the altar so there won't be any more anger on Israel. 6I'll give your fellow Levites to you, dedicated to the LORD, to service the Tent of Meeting. 7But you and your sons will tend to everything around the altar and inside the curtain. I'm giving you the priesthood as a service; execute any outsider that comes near."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then the LORD told Aaron, "I've put you in charge of my heave offerings. 9As a permanent allotment, I've given you and your sons the holy gifts the Israelites bring. That will be yours from the most holy things, reserved from the fire. Every grain offering, sin offering, and gift offering will be most holy for you and your sons. 10Every male of yours will eat them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Their wave offerings are yours too. I've given them to you and your sons and daughters as an ongoing allotment. Anybody in your family that's ceremonially clean can eat them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I've given you the best of the fresh olive oil, fresh wine, and grain— the first part of the harvest that the people bring to me. 13They belong to you. Anybody in your family that's ceremonially clean can eat them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Devoted things in Israel are yours. 15You'll have the first issue of the womb of people and animals that's offered to me. Nevertheless, you'll redeem firstborn people and ceremonially unclean animals. 16The redemption price from a month old will be 2 oz of silver 5 shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs a shekel). 17But you can't redeem a firstborn ox, sheep, or goat; they're holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar and offer up their fat in smoke as a burnt offering, for an aroma pleasing to me. 18All their meat will be yours like the breast of a wave offering and the right thigh. 19The holy gifts are a permanent allotment to you, your sons, and daughters—a permanent covenant of salt with me for you and your descendants."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The LORD told Aaron, "You won't own or inherit land. I'm your portion, service in the Tent of Meeting. 21I've given the Levites a tithe from Israel as payment for their service. 22Israelites can't approach the Tent of Meeting anymore, or they'll be held guilty and die. 23Only Levites will perform service there. They'll bear that responsibility as an ongoing statute throughout your generations. [24]"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The LORD told Moses to tell the Levites, 26"When you receive the tithe from Israel, present a tenth of it to the LORD. 27It will be considered equivalent to the grain from the threshing floor or the wine from the wine vat. 28You, too, will present an offering to the LORD —from the tithes you receive. Present it to Aaron the priest 29from the best of the tithes, their sacred portion.  30Tell them, 'When you've offered the best of it, the rest will be considered equivalent to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor or the wine vat. 31You and your families can eat it anywhere; it's your compensation for service in the Tent of Meeting. 32You won't be held guilty when you've offered the best of it. Don't profane the Israelites' sacred gifts, or you'll die.'"</span>
