## Numbers Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD said to Moses, 2"Tell the Israelites to get a rod from each family leader. Write each man's name on his rod 3and write Aaron's name on Levi's rod. 4Then put them in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony where I meet you.  5The rod of the man I choose will sprout. I'll stifle the criticism of your critics.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Moses told the Israelites to give him a rod for each family leader (12 rods) with Aaron's rod among them. 7Moses put the rods in front of the LORD in the Tent of Testimony.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The next day Moses went into the Tent, and Aaron's rod had sprouted, put out buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. 9Moses brought out the rods as the Israelites watched and each man took his rod. 10But the LORD told Moses, "Put Aaron's rod back in front of the Testimony to keep as a sign against the rebels so you can stop their complaining against me and they don't die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Moses did that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Israelites said to Moses, "We're perishing! We're all dying! 13Everybody that goes near the Tabernacle dies. Are we all going to perish?"</span>
