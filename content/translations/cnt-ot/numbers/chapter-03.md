## Numbers Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Generations of Aaron and Moses</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The sons of Aaron were Nadab, the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar—3anointed and ordained as priests. 4In the Wilderness of Sinai, Nadab and Abihu died from offering before the LORD, fire different from what he'd commanded. They didn't have any children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during Aaron's lifetime.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD told Moses, 6"Set the tribe of Levi aside to serve Aaron. 7They'll perform duties for him and the whole community at the Tent of Meeting. They'll service the Tabernacle 8and keep the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting in assisting with the duties of the people. 9Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. 10Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; execute any layman that tries to come near."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Again the LORD told Moses, 12"I've taken the Levites from the people in place of the firstborn. 13The firstborn belong to me. When I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart to myself the firstborn people and animals in Israel. The Levites belong to me; I'm the LORD."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, 15"Count the descendants of Levi by families—every male a month old and up." 16Moses counted them:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The Libnites and Shimeites descended from Gershon. 22Their males a month old and up numbered 7,500. 23They camped west of the Tabernacle, behind it. 24Eliasaph son of Lael was family leader among the Gershonites. 25The sons of Gershon serviced the Tent of Meeting, including the Tabernacle and tent, its covering, the screen for the door to the Tent of Meeting, 26the hangings around the court, and the screen for the door to the court around the Tabernacle, the altar, and its cords.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites descended from Kohath. 28Their males a month old and up numbered 8,600; they serviced the sanctuary. 29They camped south of the Tabernacle. 30Elizaphan son of Uzziel was family leader among the Kohathites. 31The sons of Kohath serviced the Ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary they perform service with, and the screen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Eleazar son of Aaron, the chief leader from Levi, oversaw the ones that performed duties in the sanctuary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The Mahlites and Mushites descended from Merari. 34Their males a month old and up numbered 6,200. 35Zuriel son of Abihail was family of Merari. They camped north of the Tabernacle. 36The sons of Merari serviced the frames of the Tabernacle, its bars, posts, bases, equipment, 37together with the posts around the court with their bases, pegs, and cords.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Moses, Aaron, and his sons camped east of the Tabernacle and performed duties in the sanctuary for the obligation of Israel. Any layman that would come near was to be executed. 39The Levites that Moses and Aaron counted a month old and up numbered 22,000.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The LORD told Moses, "Count by name every male firstborn in Israel a month old and up. 41Take the Levites for me in place of Israel's firstborn sons, and take the Levites' livestock in place of the nation's firstborn livestock."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Moses counted Israel's firstborn: 4322,273 males a month old and up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> The LORD told Moses, 45"The Levites belong to me; I'm the LORD. 46For the ransom of the 273 firstborn in Israel above the number of Levites, 47take 2 oz 5 shekels per head, shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs to a shekel). 48Give the ransom money to Aaron and his sons."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Moses took the ransom money from the ones above the number ransomed by the Levites. 50From the firstborn he took the money in shekels of the sanctuary (1,365 shekels 34 lbs) 51and gave it to Aaron and his sons.</span>
