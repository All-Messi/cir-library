## Numbers Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>11</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>The people started complaining about their hardships. The LORD’s anger flared. It burned among them and burned up the outskirts of the camp. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The name of that place became Taberah, because the LORD’s fire “burned” among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Some riffraff among them had selfish interests and cried out again, <em>“Who’s going to </em><em>feed us</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>We remember the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, </em><em>melons, </em><em>leeks, onions, and garlic.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>N</em><em>ow our </em><em>appetite’s gone. T</em><em>here’s nothing to look at except this manna.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The manna was like coriander seed and looked like bdellium. <sup>8</sup>The people would go around and gather it up, grind it between millstones, mash it in mortars, or boil it in pots and make cakes. The cakes tasted like they were baked with olive oil. <sup>9</sup>Manna fell with the dew at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Moses heard the families whining at the entrance to their tents. The LORD’s anger kindled greatly, and Moses wasn’t pleased. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He asked the LORD, <em>“Why </em><em>be</em><em> so hard on </em><em>me</em><em>?</em><em> How</em><em> have I </em><em>displeased you that you’</em><em>ve laid the </em><em>responsibility for</em><em> all these people on me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Was I the one that conceived </em><em>them</em><em> and </em><em>had them</em><em>, that you should </em><em>tell me to c</em><em>arry them in </em><em>my</em><em> arms like a nurse carries a nursing infant to the land you swore to their ancestors?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Where can I get meat for all these people?</em><em> </em><em>They</em><em>’re</em><em> c</em><em>rying to me for something to eat! </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I can’t carry </em><em>them; they’re</em><em> too </em><em>heavy</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>If you’re going to deal with me this way, </em><em>take my life</em><em> now if I</em><em>’m pleasing to </em><em>you.</em><em> Spare me the</em><em> </em><em>misery</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>

### Elders Appointed to Help Moses


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>The LORD told Moses, <em>“Gather</em><em> the </em><em>70</em><em> elders and their officers</em><em> at the Tent of Meeting. Have</em><em> them stand there with you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I’ll come down and speak to you an</em><em>d take the Spirit that’s on you</em><em> and put on them.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll bear </em><em>responsibility for</em><em> the people</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>too,</em><em> so you won’t be </em><em>bearing</em><em> it by yourself.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Tell the</em><em>m</em><em>, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tom</em><em>orrow, and you’ll eat meat because you’</em><em>ve cr</em><em>ied, “Oh that someone would feed us</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>We were well-off in Egypt.”</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will give you meat and you’ll eat it—</em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>not </em><em>1</em><em> day,</em><em> 2</em><em> days,</em><em> 5</em><em>, </em><em>10,</em><em> or </em><em>20</em><em> day</em><em>s</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>but for a whole month, til</em><em>l it comes out </em><em>your nostrils and </em><em>you sick of it. That’s because y</em><em>ou’ve rejected the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em>’s among you and </em><em>whined</em><em> </em><em>to his face</em><em>, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But Moses said, <em>“</em><em>There are </em><em>600,000 </em><em>people around me; </em><em>yet you’ve said</em><em> you’d</em><em> give them meat </em><em>for a month. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Should they </em><em>butcher</em><em> flocks and herds to get enough</em><em> or try</em><em> t</em><em>o</em><em> </em><em>catch</em><em> all the fish in the sea</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>The LORD said, <em>“</em><em>Am I</em><em> limi</em><em>ted?</em><em> You’ll s</em><em>ee if </em><em>what I said</em><em> comes true.”</em><strong> </strong></span>

### elders and stationed them around the tent. 25The LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him. The Spirit that was on Moses he put on them. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they never did it again.


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Two men had remained in the camp, Eldad and Medad. The Spirit rested on them, and they kept on prophesying. (They were among the ones that had been registered but hadn’t gone out to the Tent.) <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>A young man ran and told Moses<em>, “Eldad and Medad </em><em>a</em><em>re </em><em>prophesying in the </em><em>camp.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em> <em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 11:24-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant from his youth, said, <em>“</em><em>Moses, my lord, </em><em>stop</em><em> them.”</em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“Are you jealous for me? Oh that all the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> people were prophets, and he would put his Spirit on them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Moses and the elders went back to the camp. <strong>The L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> Sends Quail</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The LORD made a wind blow from the sea to bring quail. They fell about a day’s walk away all around the camp—</span>

### ft deep all over the ground. 32The people spent all day, all night, and the next day picking them up and spreading them out all around the camp. The least anybody gathered was 62.5 bushels. 33While they chewed the meat, the LORD’s anger flared at them; he struck them with a severe plague. 34So they called the place Kibroth-hattaavah because they put in “graves” the people that had been “greedy.” 35From Kibroth-hattaavah they set out for Hazaroth and stayed there.
