### The Israelites Oppressed


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In time, a new king came to power in Egypt who didn’t know Joseph. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He told his people, <em>“The</em><em>re are too many Israelites, </em><em>and </em><em>they’re </em><em>too </em><em>strong</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Let’s deal wi</em><em>th them wisely so, if there’s </em><em>war, they won’t join our enemies and leave.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They appointed taskmasters and subjected the <em>Israelites</em> to hard labor. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But the more they mistreated them, the more they multiplied and spread. The <em>Egyptians</em> were afraid of them [<strong><sup>13</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and made their lives miserable, making bricks and mortar and laboring in the fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The king told the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“When you’re helping the Hebrew women on the birth stool, kill </em><em>the boys</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But the midwives respected God and let them live. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The king called them in and asked, <em>“Why have you let the boys live?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>“</em><em>Hebrew women aren’t like Egyptian women.</em><em> </em><em>They </em><em>deliver quickly</em><em> before midwives can get </em><em>there</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God was good to the midwives, and the people kept multiplying. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Because the midwives respected God, he gave them families of their own. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Pharaoh kept telling his people to throw the boys in the Nile but keep the girls.</span>
