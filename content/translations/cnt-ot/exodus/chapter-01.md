## Exodus Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel's descendants and their households that went to Egypt with Jacob: 2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 3Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 4Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher: 570 people (though Joseph was already there)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> That whole generation died, 7but Israel's descendants multiplied and became so numerous they filled the country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In time, a new king came to power in Egypt who didn't know Joseph. 9He told his people, "There are too many Israelites, and they're too strong. 10Let's deal with them wisely so, if there's war, they won't join our enemies and leave." 11They appointed taskmasters and subjected the Israelites to hard labor. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 12But the more they mistreated them, the more they multiplied and spread. The Egyptians were afraid of them [13] 14and made their lives miserable, making bricks and mortar and laboring in the fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The king told the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah, 16"When you're helping the Hebrew women on the birth stool, kill the boys." 17But the midwives respected God and let them live. 18The king called them in and asked, "Why have you let the boys live?" 19"Hebrew women aren't like Egyptian women. They deliver quickly before midwives can get there." 20God was good to the midwives, and the people kept multiplying. 21Because the midwives respected God, he gave them families of their own. 22Pharaoh kept telling his people to throw the boys in the Nile but keep the girls.</span>
