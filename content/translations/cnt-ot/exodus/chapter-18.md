## Exodus Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jethro/<em>Reuel</em>, priest in Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard what all God had done for Moses and his people in bringing them out of Egypt. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He’d taken Moses’ wife Zipporah after <em>Moses</em> sent her away <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>with her two sons Gershom (because he said, <em>“I’ve been a </em><em>‘foreigner’</em><em> in a foreign land”</em><em>)</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and Eliezer (because he said, <em>“My father’s </em><em>‘</em><em>God helped</em><em>’</em><em> me and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword”</em>). <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><sup>-6</sup></strong>Jethro/<em>Reuel</em> came to Moses with his wife and two sons, where <em>Moses</em> camped at the mountain of God. He sent word that he was bringing them<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Moses</em> went out to meet him, bowed and kissed him. They asked each other how they were doing and went into the tent. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Moses told him what all the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, the hardships they’d had on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jethro/<em>Reuel</em> was overjoyed at the LORD’s goodness to Israel. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Bless</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> that delivered you from </em><em>Pharaoh and </em><em>the Egyptians</em><em>’ control</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Now I know </em><em>he’s</em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>greater than all other gods. H</em><em>e proved it when they dealt arrogantly against </em>the people<em>.</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Jethro/<em>Reuel</em> brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with the elders to eat a meal with him in God’s presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The next day Moses sat judging the people. They stood around him from morning till evening. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When <em>Jethro</em><em>/Reuel</em> saw what he was doing, he asked, <em>“What</em><em> are </em><em>you doing?</em><em> </em><em>Why sit </em>to judge<em> so many </em><em>people </em><em>by yourself </em><em>from morning to </em><em>evening</em><em>?</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>T</em><em>he</em><em>y</em><em> come to me to </em><em>ask</em><em> God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>When they</em><em> have a dispute, </em><em>I </em><em>decid</em><em>e between </em><em>them</em><em> and </em><em>teach </em>them <em>God’s laws and statues.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>That’s not </em><em>good.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> and the people will both wear out</em><em>.</em><em> Your</em><em> job’s too big.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Here’s </em><em>some advice and God be with you.</em><em> B</em><em>e the people’s representative </em><em>to</em><em> God and bring the disputes to him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Then teach</em><em> them the laws and statutes, </em><em>how they’re supposed to act and </em><em>what</em><em> they’re supposed to do.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Select capable men that </em><em>respect</em><em> God, truthful men that hate disho</em><em>nest gain. Make them</em><em> leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Let them judge </em><em>lesser</em><em> matters.</em><em> T</em><em>hey can bring </em><em>m</em><em>ajor disputes to you</em><em>. It’</em><em>ll be easier </em><em>on</em><em> you</em><em>;</em><em> they’ll </em><em>help you </em><em>bear the burden.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>If you do th</em><em>at</em><em>—and God </em><em>agrees</em><em>—you’ll </em><em>hold up under</em><em> the work, and the people will go home </em><em>satisfied</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Moses took his advice <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and chose capable men to lead thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They judged on a regular basis and dealt with smaller issues. More difficult disputes they took to Moses. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Moses said goodbye to <em>Jethro/Reuel</em>, and he went back home.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>              </strong></span>
