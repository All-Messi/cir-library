## Exodus Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jethro/<em>Reuel</em>, priest in Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard what all God had done for Moses and his people in bringing them out of Egypt. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He’d taken Moses’ wife Zipporah after <em>Moses</em> sent her away <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>with her two sons Gershom (because he said, <em>“I’ve been a </em><em>‘foreigner’</em><em> in a foreign land”</em><em>)</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and Eliezer (because he said, <em>“My father’s </em><em>‘</em><em>God helped</em><em>’</em><em> me and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword”</em>). <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><sup>-6</sup></strong>Jethro/<em>Reuel</em> came to Moses with his wife and two sons, where <em>Moses</em> camped at the mountain of God. He sent word that he was bringing them<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Moses</em> went out to meet him, bowed and kissed him. They asked each other how they were doing and went into the tent. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Moses told him what all the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, the hardships they’d had on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jethro/<em>Reuel</em> was overjoyed at the LORD’s goodness to Israel. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Bless</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> that delivered you from </em><em>Pharaoh and </em><em>the Egyptians</em><em>’ control</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Now I know </em><em>he’s</em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>greater than all other gods. H</em><em>e proved it when they dealt arrogantly against </em>the people<em>.</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jethro/<em>Reuel</em> brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with the elders to eat a meal with him in God’s presence.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 18:1-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The next day Moses sat judging the people. They stood around him from morning till evening. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When <em>Jethro</em><em>/Reuel</em> saw what he was doing, he asked, <em>“What</em><em> are </em><em>you doing?</em><em> </em><em>Why sit </em>to judge<em> so many </em><em>people </em><em>by yourself </em><em>from morning to </em><em>evening</em><em>?</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Moses took his advice <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and chose capable men to lead thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They judged on a regular basis and dealt with smaller issues. More difficult disputes they took to Moses. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Moses said goodbye to <em>Jethro/Reuel</em>, and he went back home.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>              </strong><strong>Ex 18:13-27</strong> <strong>At Mount Sinai</strong></span>
