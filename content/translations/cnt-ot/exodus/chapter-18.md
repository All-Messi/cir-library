## Exodus Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jethro/Reuel, priest in Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard what all God had done for Moses and his people in bringing them out of Egypt. 2He'd taken Moses' wife Zipporah after Moses sent her away 3with her two sons Gershom (because he said, "I've been a 'foreigner' in a foreign land") 4and Eliezer (because he said, "My father's 'God helped' me and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword"). 5-6Jethro/Reuel came to Moses with his wife and two sons, where Moses camped at the mountain of God. He sent word that he was bringing them. 7Moses went out to meet him, bowed and kissed him. They asked each other how they were doing and went into the tent. 8Moses told him what all the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, the hardships they'd had on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them. 9Jethro/Reuel was overjoyed at the LORD's goodness to Israel. 10He said, "Bless the LORD that delivered you from Pharaoh and the Egyptians' control. 11Now I know he's greater than all other gods. He proved it when they dealt arrogantly against the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jethro/Reuel brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with the elders to eat a meal with him in God's presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The next day Moses sat judging the people. They stood around him from morning till evening. 14When Jethro/Reuel saw what he was doing, he asked, "What are you doing? Why sit to judge so many people by yourself from morning to evening?" 15"They come to me to ask God. 16When they have a dispute, I decide between them and teach them God's laws and statues." 17"That's not good. 18You and the people will both wear out. Your job's too big. 19Here's some advice and God be with you. Be the people's representative to God and bring the disputes to him. 20Then teach them the laws and statutes, how they're supposed to act and what they're supposed to do. 21Select capable men that respect God, truthful men that hate dishonest gain. Make them leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 22Let them judge lesser matters. They can bring major disputes to you. It'll be easier on you; they'll help you bear the burden. 23If you do that—and God agrees—you'll hold up under the work, and the people will go home satisfied."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Moses took his advice 25and chose capable men to lead thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 26They judged on a regular basis and dealt with smaller issues. More difficult disputes they took to Moses. 27Moses said goodbye to Jethro/Reuel, and he went back home.</span>
