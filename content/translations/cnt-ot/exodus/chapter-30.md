### Atonement Money [11] 12“When you take a census of the Israelites, each one will give a ransom for himself to the LORD so there won’t be any plague among them. 13-14Each person that’s counted from 20 years up will give .2 oz a half-shekel of the sanctuary as a contribution to the LORD (20 gerahs to a shekel). 15Rich and poor will contribute the same .2 oz a half-shekel of to make atonement. 16Give it for the service of the Tent of Meeting as a memorial to the LORD.   	Ex 30:11-16  	Bronze Basin for Washing [17] 18“Make a bronze laver with a bronze base, put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 19Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and feet from it 20when they go into the Tent of Meeting so they won’t die when they approach the altar to offer up in smoke a sacrifice by fire to me.  21That will be an ongoing statute for Aaron and his descendants.	 Ex 30:17-21 	Anointing Oil [22] 23“Take the finest spices: 12½ lbs 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cinnamon, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cane, 2412½ lbs 500 shekels of cassia, and 1½ gallons hin of olive oil. 25From them, make a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, a perfumer’s work. 26With it, anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of Testimony, 27the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 28the altar of burnt offering and its instruments, and the laver and its stand. 29Consecrate them so they’ll be holy. Whatever touches them will be holy. 30Anoint Aaron and his sons to consecrate them for performing service to me as priests. 31Tell the Israelites, ‘This will be an anointing oil holy to me throughout your generations. 32Don’t make any oil in the same proportions or pour it on anybody else. It’s holy, reserved for you. 33Whoever mixes any oil like it or puts any of it on a layman, will be excluded from the community.’” 	Ex 30:22-33 	Incense
