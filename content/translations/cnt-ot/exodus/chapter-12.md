## Exodus Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses and Aaron,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Moses called Israel’s elders, <em>“</em><em>Butcher</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> Passover lamb</em><em> for each family</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Dip a bunch of hyssop </em><em>in the blood that’s in the basin and apply </em><em>it to the lintel and</em><em> doorposts.</em><em> Don’t anyone </em><em>go outside till morning.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will pass through to s</em><em>trike down</em><em> the Egyptians.</em><em> </em><em>When he sees the blood on the lintel and </em><em>doorposts, he’</em><em>ll pass over and not </em><em>let</em><em> the </em><em>destroyer </em><em>come in to strike you.</em><em> [</em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>]</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>When you go in</em><em>to</em><em> the land the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> gives you, </em><em>observe this rite.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>When your children </em><em>ask you w</em><em>hat </em><em>it</em><em> mean</em><em>s,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>tell them i</em><em>t’s a Passover sacrifice to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, who </em><em>“</em><em>passed over</em><em>”</em><em> the </em><em>Israelites’ </em><em>houses when he struck the Egyptians.”</em> The people bowed low in worship <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>and did what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 12:21-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> At midnight the LORD struck the firstborn in Egypt—the firstborn of Pharaoh on the throne, the firstborn of captives in the dungeon, the firstborn livestock. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Pharaoh, his officers, and all the Egyptians got up during the night. There was a great outcry in Egypt; every home had someone die. <strong>The Exodus</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He called for Moses and Aaron during the night<em>, </em> <em>“Get up! Get away from my people,</em><em> </em><em><u>you and the Israelites</u></em><em><u>!</u></em><em><u> Go worship the </u></em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em><u> like you’ve said. </u></em><strong><u><sup>32</sup></u></strong><em><u>Take your flocks and herds</u></em><em>. Go</em><em> and bless me too.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The Egyptians urged the people to leave right away, <em>“We’ll all be dead!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> The people took their dough before it had yeast put in it, together with their kneading bowls tied up in the cloaks on their shoulders. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>The Israelites had done what Moses said and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold articles, and for clothes. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>The LORD had given the Egyptians a favorable attitude toward them, so they let them have what they asked for. That’s how they “plundered” the Egyptians.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 12:29-36</p>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot plus women and children. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>A mixed crowd <em>of non-Israelites </em>went with them along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>The dough they brought out of Egypt they baked into flat cakes of bread without yeast. It had no yeast in it because they were driven out and couldn’t delay. They hadn’t prepared supplies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The Israelites lived in Egypt 430 years. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong><strong>At the end of 430 years </strong>to the day, the hosts of the LORD left Egypt. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>It’s a night Israelites observe to him throughout their generations for bringing them out of Egypt.</span>

### Instructions for Passover


<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> The LORD told Moses and Aaron, <em>“This is the ordinance about</em><em> the Passover:</em><em> </em><em>no foreigner </em><em>can</em><em> eat it, </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>but every man’s slave purchased with money can eat it after you’ve circumcised him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>No</em><em> hired </em><em>hand can</em><em> eat it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>E</em><em>at</em><em> it</em><em> in a single house.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t </em><em>take</em><em> any of the meat out of the house </em><em>or</em><em> break any of its bones.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>The whole </em><em>community of Israel</em><em> is to celebrate it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f a foreigner </em><em>that lives with you wants to celebrate it, </em><em>all the males that belong to him </em><em>need to</em><em> be circumcised.</em><em> </em><em>Then he</em><em> can come to celebrate it. He’ll become a citizen of the country, b</em><em>ut no uncircumcised person can eat it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>The same law applies to </em><em>a </em><em>native </em><em>and</em><em> </em><em>foreigner</em><em> among you.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> The Israelites did what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>That same day, he brought them out of Egypt.</span>
