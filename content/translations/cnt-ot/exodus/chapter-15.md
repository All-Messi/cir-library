## Exodus Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD is my strength and song;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He's a soldier;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He has thrown Pharaoh's chariots and army into the Red Sea;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The depths covered them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your right hand, LORD, was majestic in its power;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In your extreme excellence, you overthrew your opponents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> At the blast of your nostrils, the water piled up;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The enemy said, 'I'll pursue,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You blew with your wind; the sea covered them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Who is like you, majestic in holiness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You reached out your hand,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In your kindness you led the people you redeemed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The nations have heard and tremble;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The chiefs in Edom are scared;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Panic and dread have fallen on them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You'll take them and plant them in the mountain</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The LORD will reign forever."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and cavalry went into the sea, and the LORD washed the water back over them; but the Israelites walked through on dry seabed. 20Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine and went out with the women with tambourines and dancing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> She lined out a song to them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Moses led the Israelites from the Red Sea to the Wilderness of Shur. They traveled three days without finding water. 23When they got to Marah, the water was too "brackish" to drink. That's why it was called Marah. 24The people complained to Moses, "What are we going to drink?" 25He called out to the LORD, and he showed him a tree. Moses threw it in the water and made it drinkable. The LORD made a statute and regulation to test them. 26"If you sincerely pay attention to me, do what I consider right, listen to my commandments, and keep my statutes, I won't put any disease on you that I put on the Egyptians, because I'm your healer."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They came to Elim with its 12 springs and 70 date palms, and camped there beside the water.</span>
