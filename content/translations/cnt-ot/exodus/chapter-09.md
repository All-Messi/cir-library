## Exodus Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told Moses, "Go tell Pharaoh, 'The LORD God of the Hebrews says to let his people go so they can serve him. 2If you keep holding them, 3he'll bring a severe plague on your livestock in the pasture—horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks. 4But he'll distinguish Israel's livestock from Egypt's. Nothing will die that belongs to the Israelites.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD set a time, "I'll do that in the country tomorrow." 6The next day he did it. Livestock in Egypt died, but none of the Israelites' livestock died. 7Pharaoh sent to find out that not a one of the Israelites' livestock died, but he hardened his heart and wouldn't let the people go.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The LORD told Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of ashes out of a kiln and throw them up in the air in front of Pharaoh. 9They'll become fine dust all over Egypt, and make boils break out with sores on people and animals everywhere in the country."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They took ashes out of a kiln and stood in front of Pharaoh. Moses threw them up in the air, and they made boils break out in sores on people and animals. 11The magicians couldn't withstand Moses because of the boils. They came on the magicians as well as all the Egyptians. 12The LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't listen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD told Moses, "Get up early, present yourselves to Pharaoh and tell him, 'The LORD God of the Hebrews says, "Let my people go so they can serve me. 14This time I'll send my plagues on you, your officers, and your people so you can know there's nobody on earth like me. 15If I'd struck you and your people with a deadly plague, you wouldn't be here 16 to see my power and to make myself known all over the world. 17You still rise up against my people and won't let them go. 18About this time tomorrow, I'll send heavy hail beyond anything Egypt has ever had. 19Bring inside whatever livestock you have in the pasture. People and animals will die that are not inside."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Pharaoh's officers that respected the LORD made their servants and livestock get under shelter. 21Those who didn't pay attention left them out in the open.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The LORD told Moses, "Hold your hand toward the sky so hail will fall on the people, animals, and plants out in the open everywhere in Egypt." 23He pointed his staff at the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the ground. 24There was really severe hail and lightning flashing continually in the hail, like nothing that had ever happened in Egypt since it became a nation. 25The hail struck everything that was out in the open everywhere in Egypt—people, animals, plants in the field, and shattered the trees. 26Only in Goshen, where the Israelites lived, there wasn't any hail.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, "I've sinned this time. The LORD is right; my people and I are wrong. 28Pray to him. We've had enough of his thunder and hail. I'll let you go for good."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Moses told him, "As soon as I leave the city, I'll spread out my hands to the LORD. The thunder and hail will stop, and you'll know the world belongs to the LORD. 30But I'm sure you and your officers still won't respect him." 31(The hail ruined the flax and barley crops because the barley had headed out and the flax had budded. 32It didn't ruin the wheat and spelt, which ripen later.) 33Moses left Pharaoh and the city and spread out his hands to the LORD. The thunder, hail, and rain quit pouring down. 34When Pharaoh saw it stop, he and his officers sinned again and hardened their hearts. 35He wouldn't let the people go.</span>
