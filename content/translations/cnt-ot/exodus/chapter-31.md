## Exodus Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've specifically called Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah. 3I've filled him with my spirit in wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I've appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan. In the hearts of everybody that's skilled, I've put the skill to make everything: [12] 13"Tell the Israelites to observe my Sabbaths. They're a sign between you and me throughout your generations so you can know I'm the LORD who sanctifies you. 14The Sabbath is set aside for you. Execute anybody that profanes it. Exclude from the community whoever works on it. 15Work for six days, but the seventh day will be a complete rest set aside to me. 16Israelites will observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a continuing covenant. 17It's a permanent sign between them and me, because I made earth and sky in six days, but stopped working on the seventh day and was refreshed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When God finished speaking to him on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets of the Testimony that God wrote with his own finger.</span>
