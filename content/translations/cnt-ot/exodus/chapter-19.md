## Exodus Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The same day of the third month after Israel left Egypt, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai. 2They'd set out from Rephidim and came to camp at the mountain. 3Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, "Tell Jacob's house, 4'You'vepl seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to me. 5If you'll obey me and keep my covenant, you'll be my special possession among the nations. The whole world belongs to me, 6but you'll be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Moses called the elders and told them. 8They answered together, "We'll do everything the LORD said." Moses went back to tell him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told Moses, "I'll come to you in a dark cloud so the people can hear when I speak to you and believe in you permanently. 10"Go consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes 11and be ready on the third day. That day I'll come down on Mount Sinai where they can see. 12Set upf boundaries and say, 'Don't go up on the mountain or touch it. Executef whoever touches it. 13Don't touchf them; stonef them or shootf them. Human or animal won't live.' When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, the people are to come to the mountain."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Moses came down from the mountain, consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes. 15He told them to be ready the third day and not to have relations with women.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The third morning, thunder and lightning came. A dark cloud came over the mountain accompanied by a loud bugle blast. The people in the camp trembled. 17Moses brought them out of the camp to meet God at the foot of the mountain. 18Smoke covered Mount Sinai because the LORD came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like from a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. 19When the bugle blast got louder and louder, Moses spoke to God, and he answered him with thunder. 20He came down on Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the top of it. 21"Go down and warn the people not to break through to stare and many of them perish. 22Have the priests that come near to me consecrate themselves so I don't flare out against them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Moses told the LORD, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai, because you warned us to set boundaries around it and consecrate it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The LORD said, "Go down and bring Aaron up. Don't let the priests or the people break through to come up to me, or I'll flare out against them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Moses went down and told them.</span>
