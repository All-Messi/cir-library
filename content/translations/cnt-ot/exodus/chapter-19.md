## Exodus Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The same day of the <strong>third month</strong> after Israel left Egypt, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They’d set out from Rephidim and came to camp at the mountain. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, <em>“Tell Jacob</em><em>’s house</em><em>,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>‘You’ve</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles</em><em>’</em><em> wings and brought you to m</em><em>e</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If you’ll obey me and keep my covenant, you’ll be my special possession among </em><em>the </em><em>nations.</em><em> </em><em>The whole world </em><em>belongs to me</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>but yo</em><em>u’ll be a kingdom of priests,</em><em> a holy nation.’”</em><em>	 </em><strong>Ex 19:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Moses called the elders and told them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They answered together, <em>“We’ll</em><em> do everything the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> said.” </em>Moses went back to tell him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told Moses, <em>“I’ll come to you in a </em><em>dark</em><em> cloud so the people can hear when I speak </em><em>to</em><em> you and believe in you permanently.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Moses came down from the mountain, consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He told them to be ready the third day and not to have relations with women<em>.</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 19:7-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The third morning, thunder and lightning came. A dark cloud came over the mountain accompanied by a loud bugle blast. The people in the camp trembled. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Moses brought them out of the camp to meet God at the foot of the mountain. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Smoke covered Mount Sinai because the LORD came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like from a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>When the bugle blast got louder and louder, Moses spoke to God, and he answered him with thunder. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He came down on Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the top of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Moses told the LORD, <em>“The people can’t come up to Mount </em><em>Sinai, because you warned us to s</em><em>et boundaries around </em><em>it and consecrate it.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The LORD said, <em>“Go down a</em><em>nd bring Aaron up. D</em><em>on’t let the priests </em><em>or</em><em> the people break through to come up to </em><em>me, or I</em><em>’ll </em><em>flare out against</em><em> them.”</em></span>
