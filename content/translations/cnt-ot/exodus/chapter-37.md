## Exodus Chapter 37

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bezalel made the Ark out of acacia wood: 45 x 27 x 27ins high. 2He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, made a gold border around it, 3and cast 4 gold rings for it, 2 on each side. 4He shaped poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold 5and put them in the rings for carrying it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He formed a mercy seat out of pure gold: 45 x 27in. 7It had 2 hammered gold cherubs for the ends of the mercy seat, 8and were one piece with it. 9Their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat and facing each other.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then he made the table out of acacia wood: 36 x 18 x 27in high. 11He overlaid it with pure gold, put a molding around it, 12formed a rim for it a hand's width, and a gold molding for the rim. 13He cast 4 gold rings for the bottom 4 corners 14close to the rim for holding the poles that carried the table. 15He shaped the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 16 Out of pure gold he fashioned the utensils for the table: dishes, pans, bowls, and jars for pouring liquid offerings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He formed the lampstand out of pure hammered gold with its base, shaft, cups, bulbs, and flowers as one piece. 18There were 6 branches, 3 coming out of each side. 19It had cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb, and a flower on each branch. 20On the lampstand there were 4 cups shaped like almond blossoms, its bulbs, and its flowers. 21There was a bulb under each of the three pairs of branches coming out of the lampstand. 22Their bulbs and branches were one piece with the lampstand; the whole thing was a single hammered work of pure gold. 23Out of pure gold he formed its 7 lamps with its snuffers and trays. 24He fashioned it and its utensils out of 75½ lbs a talent of pure gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He made the altar of incense out of acacia wood: 18 x 18 x 36in high. Its horns were one piece with it. 26He overlaid its top, sides, and horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it. 27For each side under its molding he made two gold rings to hold the poles for carrying it. 28He fashioned the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 29He made the holy anointing oil and pure fragrant incense out of spices—an incense maker's work.</span>
