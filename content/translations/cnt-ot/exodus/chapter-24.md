## Exodus Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the LORD told Moses, "Come up to me and worship at a distance—you, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders. 2Yousg alone will approach me; the others and the community can't approach me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Moses recounted to the people the LORD's ordinances, and they answered together, "We'll do what he's said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Moses wrote them down. Then he got up early and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with 12 pillars for the 12 tribes. 5He sent young men to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice young bulls as peace offerings. 6Moses put half of the blood in basins and sprinkled the other half on the altar. 7He read the covenant to the people. They said, "We'll do what the LORD has said." 8Moses sprinkled the blood on them, "This is the blood of the covenant the LORD has made with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders; 10and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was what looked like an expanse of sapphire as clear as the sky. 11Yet he didn't reach out against the nobles of Israel; they looked at him and ate and drank.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The LORD told Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain and stay here. I'll give you the stone tablets with the Law I've commanded and written to instruct them." 13Moses and Joshua his assistant went up on the mountain of God. 14But he told the elders, "Wait here till we get back. Aaron and Hur are with you. If anybody has a legal problem, go to them." 15Then he went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered it. 16The LORD's brightness rested on Mount Sinai for six days. On the seventh day, he called to Moses out of the cloud. 17To the people of Israel the LORD's brightness looked like a flagrant fire on the mountain. 18Moses went into the cloud as he climbed the mountain and was there for 40 days.</span>
