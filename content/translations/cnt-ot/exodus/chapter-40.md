<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then take Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and bathe them. 13Dress Aaron in the holy vestments and anoint him to consecrate him so he can serve as a priest to me. 14Bring his sons and put tunics on them. 15Anoint them like you anointed him. Their anointing will appoint them as an ongoing permanent priesthood."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Moses did everything the LORD told him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The first day, first month, second year, he set up the Tabernacle: 18laid its bases, set up its boards, inserted its bars, and set up its posts; 19he spread the tent over the Tabernacle and put the covering on it; 20put the Testimony in the Ark, attached the poles to it, put the mercy seat on top of it, 21took it into the Tabernacle, and screened it off; 22put the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the Tabernacle outside the curtain, 23and arranged the bread on it in front of the LORD; 24placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, across from the table on the south side of the Tabernacle, 25and lit the lamps in front of the LORD; 26put the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain, 27and burned fragrant incense on it; 28set up the curtain for the door to the Tabernacle, 29set the altar for burnt offering in front of the door, and offered the burnt offering and meal offering on it; 30put the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar with water in it for washing; 31out of it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet 32when they went into the Tent of Meeting to approach the altar; 33set up the court around the Tabernacle and the altar and hung a curtain across the court entrance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the LORD's glory filled the Tabernacle. 35Moses couldn't go into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the LORD's glory filled it. 36During their travels, whenever the cloud rose up from the Tabernacle, the Israelites would move out. 37If it didn't rise up, they'd stay till it did. 38The cloud was on the Tabernacle during the day; fire was in it at night where Israel could see it.</span>
