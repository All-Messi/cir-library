## Exodus Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A descendant from Levi married a woman from Levi, 2and she had a son. When she saw he was such a handsome baby, she hid him for three months. 3When she couldn't hide him anymore, she got a papyrus reed basket and covered it with tar. She put him in it and set it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 4His sister stood a distance away to see what would happen to him. 5Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the Nile with her attendants. As she walked along the river, she saw the basket in the reeds and had her maid bring it to her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When she opened it, she saw the baby crying and felt sorry for him, "This is one of the Hebrews' babies."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then his sister asked her, "Do you want me to call a Hebrew nurse for you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Pharaoh's daughter said, "Nurse him for me, and I'll pay you." 10He grew and she took him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses because she 'pulled him out' of the water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When Moses grew up, he went out to his relatives and looked at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. 12He looked around and saw nobody was there; he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 13He went out the next day, and two Hebrews were fighting. He asked the one that started it, "Why are you hitting your friend?" 14"Who made you a ruler or judge over us? Are you going to kill me like you did that Egyptian?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When Pharaoh heard about it, he tried to execute Moses, but he fled to Midian. He sat down by a well. 16The priest in Midian had seven daughters that came to draw water and fill the troughs for their father's flock. 17Some other shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses got up and helped them and watered their flock. 18When they went to their father Reuel/Jethro, he asked, 19"An Egyptian protected us from the shepherds. He even drew water for the flock." 20"Where is he? Why did you leave him behind? Invite him to have something to eat."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Moses was willing to live with the man, and he gave him his daughter Zipporah. 22She had a son he named Gershom, "Because I've been a 'foreigner' in a foreign country."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> After a long time, that king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under the slavery. They cried out and their call for help went up to God. 24He heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 25He took notice of them; he knew who they were.</span>
