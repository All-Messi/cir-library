## Exodus Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the LORD told the community to travel from the Wilderness of Sin and camp at Rephidim. They didn't have any water and 2complained to Moses, "Give us some water."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But they were thirsty, "Why bring us up from Egypt to let us, our little ones, and our livestock die from thirst?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Moses called out to the LORD, "What am I going to do with them? They're about ready to stone me." 5"Go stand in front of them. Take some of the elders and the staff you used to strike the Nile. 6I'll stand in front of you on the rock at Horeb/Sinai. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for them to drink." Moses did that. 7He named the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites "quarreled" with him and put the LORD on trial, "Is the LORD among us or not?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Amalek came to attack Israel at Rephidim, 9so Moses told Joshua, "Choose men and go fight Amalek. Tomorrow, I'll station myself on the hill with God's staff in my hand." 10Joshua did that; Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. 11When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; when he let it come down, Amalek prevailed. 12But his hands got heavy; so they put a boulder under him to sit on; Aaron and Hur supported his hands. His hands were steady till sundown. 13Joshua outfought Amalek and his people with the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then the LORD told Moses, "Write this in a scroll to remember. Tell Joshua I'll completely wipe out the memory of Amalek." 15Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner [Yahveh-nissi]. 16He said, "The LORD has sworn he'll be at war with Amalek endlessly."</span>
