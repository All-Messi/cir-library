## Exodus Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD said to Moses, 2"Tell the Israelites to turn around and camp at Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea across from Baal-zephon. 3Pharaoh will say you're wandering aimlessly; the open country has boxed you in. 4That's how I'll harden his heart, and he'll chase you. He and his army will honor me, and the Egyptians will know I'm the LORD."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When the king found out they'd left, he and his officials changed their minds, "What have we done, letting them leave from serving us?" 6He got his chariot ready and took his troops: 7600 select chariots as well as all the rest of Egypt's chariots and their officers. 8As the Israelites were leaving boldly, 9the Egyptians chased them with Pharaoh's horses, chariots, cavalry, and troops. They caught up with them camping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth across from Baal-zephon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As Pharaoh got close, the Israelites saw the Egyptians marching after them. They panicked and cried out to the LORD. 11They asked Moses, "Was it because there weren't any graves in Egypt that you've brought us out to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt? 12Didn't we tell you to just let us serve the Egyptians? It would've been better to serve them than die in the desert."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But Moses told them, "Don't be afraid! Stand by and watch the LORD deliver you. The Egyptians you see today you'll never see again. 14He'll fight for you while you just watch."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then the LORD told Moses, "Why call out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. 16Lift up your staff and hold your hand out over the sea to separate it. The Israelites will go through it on dry seabed. 17I'll harden the Egyptians' hearts so they'll go in after you; Pharaoh, his army, chariots, and cavalry. 18The Egyptians will know I'm the LORD when Pharaoh, his chariots, and cavalry honor me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> God's angel that had been going ahead of Israel, moved behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front to in back. 20The cloud and the darkness stood between the camps of Egypt and Israel; yet it gave light at night so they wouldn't come close to each other all night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Moses held his hand out over the sea, and the LORD pushed it back with a strong east wind all night. He separated the water and dried up the seabed. 22The Israelites went through the sea on dry seabed with the water like a wall on their left and right. 23 Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and cavalry went in after them. 24Just before dawn, the LORD looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud and threw them into confusion. 25He made their chariot wheels wobble so they were hard to drive. The Egyptians shouted, "Retreat! The LORD's fighting for Israel!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The LORD told Moses, "Hold your hand out over the sea so the water will wash back over the Egyptians, their chariots, and cavalry." 27The sea washed back to its normal position at daybreak while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it. He overthrew them in the sea. 28The water washed back over the chariots and cavalry. Not a one in Pharaoh's entire army remained who followed the Israelites into the sea. [29] 30Israel saw them dead on the shore. 31When they saw the great power the LORD had used against the Egyptians, they feared him and trusted him and Moses.</span>
