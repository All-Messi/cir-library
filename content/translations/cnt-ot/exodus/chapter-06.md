## Exodus Chapter 6

I didn't make myself known to them by my name 'Yahveh.' 4I made a covenant with them to give them Canaan, where they were living as nomads. 5I've heard the Israelites' groaning because the Egyptians are holding them in slavery, and I've remembered my covenant. 6Tell the Israelites, 'I'll take you out from under Egyptian bondage and redeem you with power and great acts of judgment. 7I'll take you to be my people and be your God. You'll know I'm the LORD your God who brought you out from under the burdens the Egyptians put on you. 8I'll take you to the land I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.'"</span>
