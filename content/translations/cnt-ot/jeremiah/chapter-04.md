## Jeremiah Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If you want to come back, you can;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Swear, 'As sure as the LORD lives,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The LORD says to the people in Judah and Jerusalem:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Declare in Judah and Jerusalem:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Lift up a standard toward Zion!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> A lion has come up out of its thicket,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Put on burlap for that;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then I said, "Lord GOD, you completely misled this nation and Jerusalem when you said they'd have peace; they have a sword at their throat!" 11-12"I'll answer them, 'A scorching wind from the desert's barren hills will blow on you, a wind too strong for winnowing grain or sweeping a threshing floor. It will come at my command to pronounce condemnation on you.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Judah's enemy rises up like clouds;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jerusalem, wash the evil off your heart</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A voice declares from Dan</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Like watchmen around a field, they're against it all around</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My soul, my soul! I'm in anguish!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Disaster on top of disaster is in store,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> How long do I have to look at the standard</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I looked at the earth;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I looked at the mountains and hills,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I didn't see any people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The fertile land had become a desert;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The earth will mourn,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> At the sound of calvary and archers, every town is scattering;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> What are you going to do, desolate one?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> I hear a woman crying out in labor,</span>
