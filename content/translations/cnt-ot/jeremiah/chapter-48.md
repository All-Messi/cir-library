## Jeremiah Chapter 48

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About Moab</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> No more renown for Moab;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Moab's to be destroyed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> At the ascent to Luhith,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Run, save yourselves</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Because you trusted in your wealth and skill,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A destroyer will come on every city;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Give Moab wings so it can fly away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A curse on the one that does the LORD's work halfheartedly; 12"But the times coming," the LORD says, "when I'll send it to the ones that upset jugs, and they'll turn it upside down. They'll empty its jugs and shatter its jars. 13Moab will be disillusioned with Chemosh like Israel lost confidence in Bethel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> How can you claim to be great soldiers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Moab will be destroyed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Mourn for it, you that live near it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Stand by the road and watch, 21"Judgment has also come on the plateau—on Holon and Jahzah, on Mephaath, 22Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 23on Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 24on Kerioth, Bozrah, and the towns in Moab near and far. 25Moab's horn has been cut off and his arm broken," the LORD says. 26"Get him drunk because he's gotten arrogant toward the LORD. So Moab will wallow in his own vomit, something to be ridiculed. 27Wasn't Israel someone you ridiculed? Was he a thief caught stealing? Every time you spoke about him, you shook your head in scorn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> We've heard about Moab's great pride,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I know his insolence," the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> So I'll wail can cry out for Moab;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> So happiness and joy have been taken away 34"From Heshbon, Elealeh, and Jahaz, from Zoar, Horonaim, and Eglath-shelishiyah, they've raised their voice; because even the water in Nimrim will dry up. 35I'll put an end to Moab that offers sacrifice on the high place and burns incense to its god. 36So my heart wails like a flute for Moab and the people in Kir-heres. They've lost the abundance it produced. 37Every head's bald; every beard's shaved off. Everybody has gashes on their hands and burlap around their waists. 38There's mourning everywhere in Moab's streets and on its housetops, because I've broken it like a pot nobody cares about. 39How shattered it is! How they wail! How Moab has turned its back in humiliation. So it's something to laugh at, an object of terror to everyone around it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Its towns will be taken,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Moab will be destroyed from being a people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Terror, pit, and snare are coming on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> The one that runs from the terror</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Misfortune awaits you, Moab!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Yet later I'll restore Moab's fortunes."</span>
