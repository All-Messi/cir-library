## Jeremiah Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD told me<em>, “Go buy a linen waistcloth and put it </em><em>on. D</em><em>on’t </em><em>wash it</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>So I bought one and put it on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Then he said, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Take</em><em> it to the Euphrates and hide it in a crevice in a rock.” </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So I went and hid it there. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A long time later the LORD told me to go get it<em>. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I went and dug it out of where I’d put it. It was ruined.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Then he told me, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“</em>This waistcloth<em> illustrates how I’ll ruin arrogant Judah and Jerusalem. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>These</em><em> people are following their own stubborn hearts in serving and bowing to other gods; they won’t be good for anything—like this waistcloth. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> it clings to a person’s waist, so I made Israel and Judah for clinging to me so they could be my people, a name, praise, and glory; but they’ve ignored me. </em><em>	   </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 13:1-11</p>

### 12“So tell them that the LORD God of Israel says to fill every jug with wine. When they say, ‘Don’t we very well know how to do that?’ 13then say, ‘The LORD says, “I’m about to make everybody drunk in this land, from kings on David’s throne, to priests and prophets, and the residents in Jerusalem! 14I’ll pit them against one another, even parents against children. Pitying, feeling sorry, having compassion won’t keep me from destroying them.”’” 	Jer 13:12-14 Exile Threatened


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Listen; don’t be proud; the LORD has spoken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Honor him <em> </em>	before he brings darkness, before you stumble on the darkened mountains. If you look for light <em>then</em>, he’ll turn it into darkness and gloom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>If you don’t listen, my soul will sob in secret, my eyes will weep bitterly, tears will run down <em>my cheeks</em> because the LORD’s flock’s been captured.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Tell the king and queen mother, <em>“T</em><em>ake a low</em><em> seat,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>because your beautiful crown </em> <em>	</em><em>	has been taken from</em><em> your head.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The towns in the Negev will be closed; nobody will be able to open them; Judah will go into exile.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 13:15-19</p>

### 20“Look who’s coming from the north. 	Where are the beautiful sheep 	of the flock you were given?


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup><em>What</em><em> will you say when </em>the LORD<em> appoints over you</em> <em>	</em><em>	former allies that you taught?</em> <em>	Won’t pains come on you</em> <em>	</em><em>	like a woman in childbirth?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup><em>If</em><em> you say to yourself,</em> <em>	‘Why has this happened to me?’</em> <em>	It’s because of how sinful you are</em> <em>	</em><em>	that your skirt has been torn off,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and you’re being raped.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><em>Can</em><em> a Nubian change </em>the color of<em> his skin</em> <em>	</em><em>	or a leopard change its spots?</em> <em>	</em>Then<em> can you do good </em> <em>	</em><em>	that have the habit of doing </em><em>evil?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> I’ll scatter you like chaff in the desert wind.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup><em>That’s</em><em> the lot I’ve measured out to you,”</em> the LORD says,</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 13:20-</p>

### 25a 	“because you’ve forgotten me and trusted in lies.


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> I have stripped your skirt off over your face</em> <em>	to show your shame.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup><em>I’ve</em><em> seen your detestable deeds:</em> <em>	</em><em>	your adulteries and neighing,</em> <em>	</em><em>	your lewd prostitution right out in the open</em><em> </em><em>on the hills. </em> <em>	Misfortune awaits you, Jerusalem!</em> <em>	How long will you stay defiled?”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jer </strong><strong>13:25b-27</strong></span>
