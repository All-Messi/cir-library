## Jeremiah Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD told me, "Go buy a linen waistcloth and put it on. Don't wash it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> So I bought one and put it on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then he said, 4"Take it to the Euphrates and hide it in a crevice in a rock." 5So I went and hid it there. 6A long time later the LORD told me to go get it. 7I went and dug it out of where I'd put it. It was ruined.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then he told me, 9"This waistcloth illustrates how I'll ruin arrogant Judah and Jerusalem. 10These people are following their own stubborn hearts in serving and bowing to other gods; they won't be good for anything—like this waistcloth. 11As it clings to a person's waist, so I made Israel and Judah for clinging to me so they could be my people, a name, praise, and glory; but they've ignored me. 12"So tell them that the LORD God of Israel says to fill every jug with wine. When they say, 'Don't we very well know how to do that?' 13then say, 'The LORD says, "I'm about to make everybody drunk in this land, from kings on David's throne, to priests and prophets, and the residents in Jerusalem! 14I'll pit them against one another, even parents against children. Pitying, feeling sorry, having compassion won't keep me from destroying them."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Listen; don't be proud;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Honor him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> If you don't listen,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Tell the king and queen mother,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The towns in the Negev will be closed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> What will you say when the LORD appoints over you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> If you say to yourself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Can a Nubian change the color of his skin</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So I'll scatter you like chaff in the desert wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> That's the lot I've measured out to you," the LORD says, 		Jer 13:20-25a</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> So I have stripped your skirt off over your face</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I've seen your detestable deeds:</span>
