## Jeremiah Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message to Jeremiah About the People in Judah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Jeremiah told the people in Judah and Jerusalem: 3"From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, till now (23 years), the LORD's message has been coming to me. I've spoken to you again and again, but you've ignored me. 4He has sent you his prophets over and over, 5'Turn from your sinful ways and deeds, and live on the land I've given you and your ancestors forever. 6Don't worship and serve other gods. Don't make me angry with what you've made with your hands, and I won't hurt you.' 7But you ignored me and made me angry with what you've made with your hands to your own hurt. 8"'So, because you haven't obeyed me, 9I'm going to send for the armies in the north and for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant, and bring them against this land and surrounding nations. I'll destroy them, make them something to abhor, to gasp at, a permanent wasteland. 10I'll take away the joy and happiness, the voices of bride and groom, the sound of millstones, the light from lamps. 11This whole region will be desolate. Those nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years. 12"'When the 70 years are up, I'll punish the king of Babylon and the Babylonians for their sin. I'll make it a permanent wasteland 13and bring on it everything I've threatened in this scroll that Jeremiah prophesied. 14Many nations and great kings will make slaves out of them too. I'll pay them back for what they've done and their hands have made.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD God of Israel told me, "Take this cup of the wine of my anger and make the nations drink it. 16They'll stagger and go crazy because of the sword that's coming among them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The LORD handed me the cup, and I made the nations drink it: 18Jerusalem and the towns in Judah, its kings and officials—to make them a ruin, something to abhor, to gasp at and curse, like it is now: 19Pharaoh, Egypt's king, his attendants, officials, and people; 20foreigners, the kings of Uz, the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); 21Edom, Moab, the Ammonites; 22the kings of Tyre, Sidon, and the regions beyond the sea; 23Dedan, Tema, Buz, those who clip the hair on their temples; 24the kings of Arabia and the foreigners that live in the desert; 25the kings of Zimri, Elam, Media; 26the north near and far, one with another—all the kingdoms in the region. The king of Sheshach/Babylon will drink after them. 27"Tell them the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, 'Drink it, get drunk, vomit, fall down, and not get up; I'm sending a sword among you.' 28If they try to refuse, tell them the LORD of Hosts says, 'You will drink it! 29I'm about to bring a catastrophe on this city I've identified with, and you think you'll avoid getting punished?! I'm calling for a sword against everybody on the earth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> The judgment cry will resound to the end of the earth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The LORD of Hosts says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The LORD will slay from one end of earth to the other.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Wail, shepherds; cry out;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The shepherds won't be able to get away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Listen to the shepherds' cries,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The peaceful folds will become a wasteland</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He has left his hiding place like a lion looking for prey</span>
