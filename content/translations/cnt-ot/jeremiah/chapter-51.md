<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'll send foreign winnowers to Babylon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let the defending archer not bend his bow</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They'll fall down dead in the land of the Babylonians,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God, the LORD of Hosts,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Escape from Babylon;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Babylon has been a gold cup in the LORD's hand,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> All of a sudden Babylon has fallen!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> We tried to heal Babylon, but it didn't heal;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The LORD has brought about our vindication;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Sharpen the arrows, fill the quills!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Raise up a standard against the walls of Babylon;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You that live by lots of water, abundant in treasures,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The LORD of Hosts has sworn by himself:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He's the One that made the earth by his power,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When he speaks, there's thunder in the rain above;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Every mortal is stupid and ignorant;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They're worthless objects to ridicule;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jacob's portion is not like theirs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I'll break horse and rider in pieces,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> With you I'll destroy shepherd and flock,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They won't reuse from you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Set up a standard in the land;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Prepare the nations against it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> So the ground shakes</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> One courier runs to another,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They've seized the fords;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Zion will say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> So the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Babylon will be a pile of rubble, a den for jackals,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> They'll roar together like young lions;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When they get hungry,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> I'll bring them down like lambs to slaughter,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The River has flooded Babylon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Its towns have become something to abhor,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> I'll punish Bel in Babylon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Don't let your heart faint;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> So the time's coming</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Earth and sky and everything in them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Babylon will fall in payment for the slain in Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> You that have escaped the sword, 51We're ashamed because we've heard reproof; 53Even if Babylon ascends to the sky 54There's an outcry from Babylon, 55The LORD is going to destroy it 56The destroyer is coming against Babylon; 59The Message Jeremiah Gave to Seraiah Son of Neriah, 60Jeremiah wrote in one scroll the catastrophe to come on Babylon. 61He told Seraiah, "As soon as you get to Babylon, read this message out loud: 62'LORD, you've promised to cut this place off so nothing will live in it, people or animals, so it'll be a permanent desolation.' 63As soon as you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River. 64Say, 'In the same way, Babylon will sink and not float back up because of the catastrophe I'm going to bring on it. The workers will have worn themselves out for nothing.'"</span>
