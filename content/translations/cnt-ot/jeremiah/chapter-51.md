<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> send foreign winnowers to Babylon </em> <em>	to devastate its land.</em> <em>O</em><em>n every side they’ll </em><em>o</em><em>ppose it</em> <em>	at the time of its catastrophe.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup><em>Let</em><em> the </em>defending<em> </em><em>archer </em><em>not bend</em><em> his </em><em>b</em><em>ow</em> <em>	or stand in his </em><em>coat of mail</em><em>.</em> <em>Don’t spare the young </em><em>men;</em> <em>	devote the</em><em> whole army to destruction.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><em>They’ll</em><em> </em><em>fall down</em><em> dead in the land of the </em><em>Babylonia</em><em>ns,</em> <em>	pierced through in their streets.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>God, the LORD of Hosts, has not abandoned Israel and Judah even though their land is full of guilt in front of the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Escape from Babylon; save yourselves! Don’t get destroyed in its punishment; this is the LORD’s revenge; he’s going to render retribution to it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Babylon has been a gold cup in the LORD’s hand, intoxicating the whole region. The nations have drunk its wine; so they’re acting crazy.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:5-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>All of a sudden Babylon has fallen! Wail for it! Bring salve to heal its pain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>We tried to heal Babylon, but it didn’t heal; so abandon it and get to your own country. Its judgment has reached heaven; it towers as high as the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>The LORD has brought about our vindication; let’s recount in Zion the work of the LORD our God!</span>

### A Hymn of Praise to the LORD


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>He’s the One that made the earth by his power, that established the world by his wisdom, that stretched out the sky with his intelligence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When he speaks, there’s thunder in the rain above; he makes clouds rise up from the horizon, makes lightning for the rain, and brings wind out of his storehouses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Every mortal is stupid and ignorant; goldsmiths are disgraced by their idols because their molten images misrepresent; they can’t even breathe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>They’re worthless objects to ridicule; when they’re punished, they perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Jacob’s portion is not like theirs. <em>His God</em> has made everything; Israel is his inheritance; <u>his name is </u><u>Yahveh</u><u> of Hosts</u>.<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:15-19</p>

### Babylon’s Destruction 	 20“You’re my battle-ax and weapon; 	I’ll shatter nations with you; 		I’ll destroy kingdoms.


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> break horse and rider in pieces,</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>chariot</em><em> and </em><em>occupant</em><em>,</em> <em>	man and woman, young and old.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><em>With</em><em> you I’ll destroy shepherd and flock,</em> <em>	farmer and ox team,</em> <em>	governors and prefects.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:20-23</p>

### 24“I’ll repay Babylon and the Babylonians  for the devastation they’ve brought on Zion  right in my presence,” 	the LORD says. 25“I’m against you, destroying mountain 		that destroys the world. I’ll reach out against you 		and roll you down from the crags 		and make you a burned-out ruble.


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><em>They</em><em> won’</em><em>t</em><em> </em><em>reuse from</em><em> you </em> <em>	a cornerstone or foundation stone</em><em>.</em> <em>Y</em><em>o</em><em>u’ll be as permanent wasteland.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:24-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Set up a standard in the land; blow the bugle among the nations. Consecrate the nations against it; summon Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against it; bring on horses like bristling locusts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Prepare the nations against it, the kings of the Medes, their governors and officials, and every land they control.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>So the ground shakes because the LORD’s intention against Babylon stands: to make it an uninhabited wasteland.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:27-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they’re staying in the barracks. They’ve used up their strength and become like women. Their houses are on fire; the bars of its gates are broken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>One courier runs to another, one ambassador runs to another to tell the king of Babylon his city’s been captured from end to end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>They’ve seized the fords; they’ve burned the fortifications; the army is in panic.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:30-32</p>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, <em>	“Babylon is like a threshing floor tamped </em><em>firm;</em> <em>	in a little while threshing will begin on it.</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:33</p>

### 34“Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,  		has devoured me and crushed me. 	He has set me down like an empty cup, 		swallowed me like a monster, 		filled his stomach with my delicacies, 		and rinsed me out.”


<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>Zion will say, <em> </em><em>	“May the violence </em><em>done</em><em> to us </em> <em>	</em><em>	be done to Babylon.”</em> Jerusalem will say, <em>	“May my blood be on the people in Babylon.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>So the LORD says, <em>“I’</em><em>ll argue</em><em> your case</em> <em>	</em><em>	and take full revenge for </em><em>you;</em> <em>	I’ll dry up its River</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and dry up its oasis.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:34-36</p>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup><em>Babylon</em><em> will be a pile of rubble, a den for jackals, </em> <em>	something to abhor and gasp </em><em>at;</em><em> </em> <em>	nobody will live there.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup><em>They’ll</em><em> roar together like young </em><em>lions;</em> <em>	they’ll growl like lion cubs.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup><em>When</em><em> they get hungry,</em> <em>	I’ll serve </em><em>them</em><em> their banquet.</em> <em>I’ll make them drunk till they pass out</em><em>	</em> <em>	and put them to sleep forever.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> bring them down like lambs to slaughter,</em> <em>	like rams and male goats for </em>sacrifice<em>.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:37-40</p>

### 41“How Sheshak has been captured! 	What the whole world praised has been seized! How Babylon has become something to abhor among the nations!


<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> River has flooded Babylon,</em> <em>	swamped it in crashing waves.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup><em>Its</em><em> towns have become something to abhor,</em> <em>	a parched land, a desert,</em> <em>	a land where nobody lives</em> <em>	</em><em>	and nobody visits.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> punish Bel in Babylon</em> <em>	and make him vomit what he’s swallowed.</em> <em>The nations won’t stream to him </em><em>anymore;</em><em> </em> <em>	even Babylon’s walls have </em><em>fallen down</em><em>!</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:41-44</p>

### 45“Get out of there, my people! 	Save yourselves from my fury!


<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup><em>Don’t</em><em> let your heart </em><em>faint;</em> <em>	don’t be afraid at the report in the land</em> <em>	</em><em>	when a report comes one year,</em> <em>	</em><em>	another one comes a year later,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and violence is in the land</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	with ruler against ruler.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> the time’s coming</em> <em>	when I’ll punish the idols in Babylon.</em> <em>Its whole land will be </em><em>disgraced;</em> <em>	its slain will fall inside it.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup><em>Earth</em><em> and sky and everything in them </em> <em>	will shout for joy over Babylon,</em> <em>	because its destroyers will come from the north,”</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em>the LORD says.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:45-48</p>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup>Babylon will fall <em>in payment for</em> the slain in Israel and the whole region.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>You that have escaped the sword, leave! Don’t stay! Remember the LORD from afar and keep Jerusalem in your mind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><sup><strong>51</strong></sup>We’re ashamed because we’ve heard reproof; disgrace shows on our faces because foreigners have entered the holy places in the LORD’s Temple.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:49-51</p>

### 52“So the time’s coming  	when I’ll punish its idols, 	and the mortally wounded will groan throughout its land.


<span class="verse" id="v53"><sup><strong>53</strong></sup><em>Even</em><em> if Babylon ascends to the sky</em> <em>	and fortifies its lofty fortress,</em> <em>	destroyers will come to it from me,” </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em>the LORD says<em>.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:52-53</p>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><sup><strong>54</strong></sup>There’s an outcry from Babylon, great destruction in the land of the Babylonians!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><sup><strong>55</strong></sup>The LORD is going to destroy it and quiet its loud noise. The waves of enemies will roar, and the noise from their uproar will increase.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v56"><sup><strong>56</strong></sup>The destroyer is coming against Babylon; he’ll capture its strong men. The LORD is a God that exacts recompense; he’ll fully repay. <strong><sup>57</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>I’ll</em><em> make its </em><em>official</em><em>s and wise men drunk,</em> <em>	its gove</em><em>rnors, officers, and strong men </em><em>too;</em> <em>	</em><em>they’ll sleep forever,</em><em>”</em> <u>the King </u><u>says,</u><u> whose name is </u><u>Yahveh</u><u> of Hosts</u>. <strong><sup>58</sup></strong><em>“Babylon’s</em><em> </em><em>thick</em><em> wall</em><em>s will be completely torn down,</em> <em>	its massive gates set on </em><em>fire;</em> <em>	</em><em>so</em><em> the nations will have worked for </em><em>nothing;</em> <em>	</em><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em> build</em></strong><strong><em>ers will have worn themselves out</em></strong><em> </em> <em>	only to get their work burned.” </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 51:54-58</p>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><sup><strong>59</strong></sup>The Message Jeremiah Gave to Seraiah Son of Neriah, Grandson of Mahseiah, When He Went with Zedekiah, King of Judah, to Babylon in the <strong>Fourth Year of His Reign</strong> (Seraiah Was Quartermaster.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup>Jeremiah wrote in one scroll the catastrophe to come on Babylon. <strong><sup>61</sup></strong>He told Seraiah, <em>“As soon as you </em><em>get to</em><em> Babylon, read this message out loud</em><em>:</em> <strong><sup>62</sup></strong><em>‘</em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, you</em><em>’ve</em><em> promised to cut this place off</em><em> so nothing will live in it, people or animals, </em>so <em>it’ll be a permanent desolation.’ </em><strong><sup>63</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> soon as you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates </em>River<em>. </em><strong><sup>64</sup></strong><em>Say</em><em>, ‘</em><em>I</em><em>n the same way, </em><em>Babylon will sink and not float back up because of the catastrophe I’m going to bring on it. </em><strong><em>The workers will have worn themselves out</em></strong><em> for nothing.’”</em> Jeremiah’s message ends here<strong>.</strong></span>
