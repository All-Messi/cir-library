<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time," the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The people that survived the sword</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The LORD appeared to him from afar and said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll rebuild you, virgin of Israel!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You'll plant your vineyards on Samaria's hills again;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> There'll be a time when watchmen</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll bring them from the north country;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They'll come weeping,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Nations, listen to a message from the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD has ransomed Jacob,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The virgins will celebrate in the dance;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll fill the soul of the priests with abundance;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> There's hope for your future;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I've heard Ephraim moaning,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> After I turned around, I repented;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Is Ephraim my dear son,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> How long will you wander around,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, "They'll speak this message again in Judah's towns when I restore their fortunes:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Judah's townspeople, farmers and herdsmen will live in harmony. 25I'll satisfy the weary and refresh the fainting."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then I woke up; my sleep was pleasant. 27"The time's coming when I'll sow Israel and Judah with people and animals. 28As I've watched over them to pull up, tear down, overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster; so I'll watch over them to plant and build. 29They won't say anymore,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Everybody will die for their own sin. Those who eat sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths pucker. 31"The time's coming," the LORD says, "when I'll make a new covenant with Israel and Judah. 32It won't be like the one I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. They broke that covenant even though I was a husband to them. 33I'll make this kind of covenant with them: I'll put my Law inside them; I'll write it on their heart. I'll be their God and they'll be my people. 34No one will be teaching their brother and fellow citizen to know the LORD, because they'll all know me from least to greatest. I'll forgive their sin; I won't keep it in mind anymore."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The LORD says—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> If the sky above can be measured 38"The time's coming," the LORD says, "when the city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 39The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb and then turn to Goah. 40The whole valley of dead bodies and ashes, the fields over to the Brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate on the east—will be sacred to me, never again uprooted or thrown down."</span>
