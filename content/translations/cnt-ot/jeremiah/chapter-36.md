## Jeremiah Chapter **36**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah in the <strong>Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Son of Josiah, King of Judah</strong> <strong>Baruch Reads Aloud the </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong>’s</strong><strong> Messages</strong> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>On</em><em> a scroll</em><em>,</em><em> write </em><em>down </em><em>everything I’ve </em><em>told</em><em> you about Israel, Judah, and the nations from Josiah</em><em>’s time</em><em> till now.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Maybe</em><em> Judah will listen to the catastrophe</em><em> I intend to bring on them to get </em><em>them</em><em> to </em><em>repent</em><em>.</em><em> Then I’ll forgive them</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Jeremiah called for Baruch son of Neriah, and he wrote down the LORD’s messages that Jeremiah dictated. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He told Baruch, <em>“I </em><em>can’t </em><em>go to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> Temple.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>o</em><em> you go on a fast day and read to the </em><em>people the messages </em><em>you’ve written.</em><em> R</em><em>ead them to t</em><em>he people in Judah who </em><em>come from their </em><em>towns</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Maybe</em><em> </em><em>they’ll turn from their sinful ways</em><em> and </em><em>ask for his forgiveness. T</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has pronounced great </em><em>anger</em><em> against </em><em>them</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Baruch did that and read the messages in the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>In the <strong>ninth month, fifth year of Jehoiakim</strong><strong>/</strong><strong><em>Coniah</em></strong>, the people in Jerusalem and Judah declared a fast to the LORD. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>What Jeremiah said, Baruch read in the quarters of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, in the upper courtyard at the entry of the New Gate to the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>When Micaiah son of Gemariah heard it, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>he went down to the secretary’s office in the king’s palace. The officials were sitting there—Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and the others. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He told them what he heard Baruch reading to the people. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah (son of Shelemiah son of Cushi) to Baruch and said, <em>“Bring</em><em> the scroll you read to the people.”</em><strong>	</strong> So Baruch took it to them.</span>

### 15“Sit down and read it to us.”


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When they heard it, they turned in fear to one another and said to Baruch, <em>“We </em><em>have to</em><em> report this</em><em> to the king.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> us how you wrote this. Did </em>Jeremiah<em> dictat</em><em>e it</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“He</em><em> dictated it to me, and I wrote it in ink on the scroll.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The officials said, <em>“Both of you, go hide. Don’t tell anybody where you are.”</em> <strong>King Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>So they reported to the king what it said, but they’d deposited the scroll in the office of Elishama the secretary. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He sent Jehudi to get it, and he read it to the king and the officials standing beside him. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The king was sitting in the winter palace in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier beside him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe’s knife and throw them in the brazier till he’d burned up the whole scroll. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The king and his attendants weren’t afraid and didn’t tear their clothes. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with him not to burn the scroll, he did it anyway. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He told Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah; but the LORD hid them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah <strong>After the King Burned the Scroll</strong> <strong>Baruch Had Written at Jeremiah’s Dictation</strong> <strong>Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll</strong> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“Take</em><em> another scroll and write </em><em>down </em><em>everything </em><em>again</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>Say</em><em> </em><em>to </em><em>Jehoi</em><em>akim, king of Judah, ‘</em><em>Yo</em><em>u burned this scroll and said, “</em><em>Why did you write that the king</em><em> of Babylon will</em><em> destroy this land and empty </em><em>out </em><em>it</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>people</em><em> and animal</em><em>s?</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>his</em><em> is </em><em>the LOR’s answer: ‘You</em><em> won’t have any</em><em> descendant</em><em> to sit on </em><em>David’s</em><em> throne</em><em>. T</em><em>hey’ll toss </em><em>your</em><em> dead bod</em><em>y out to the heat of the day </em><em>and the frost</em><em> of the night</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> punish </em><em>you</em><em>,</em><em> your family, and your attendants for your sins. </em><em>I’ll bring on</em><em> you and the people in Jerusalem</em><em> and Judah the catastrophe I’ve d</em><em>eclared—but they didn’t listen.</em><em>’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>So Jeremiah gave Baruch another scroll, and dictated everything Jehoiakim had burned, and added similar messages.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
