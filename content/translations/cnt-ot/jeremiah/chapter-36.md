## Jeremiah Chapter 36

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah 2"On a scroll, write down everything I've told you about Israel, Judah, and the nations from Josiah's time till now. 3Maybe Judah will listen to the catastrophe I intend to bring on them to get them to repent. Then I'll forgive them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jeremiah called for Baruch son of Neriah, and he wrote down the LORD's messages that Jeremiah dictated. 5He told Baruch, "I can't go to the LORD's Temple. 6So you go on a fast day and read to the people the messages you've written. Read them to the people in Judah who come from their towns. 7Maybe they'll turn from their sinful ways and ask for his forgiveness. The LORD has pronounced great anger against them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Baruch did that and read the messages in the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In the ninth month, fifth year of Jehoiakim/Coniah, the people in Jerusalem and Judah declared a fast to the LORD. 10What Jeremiah said, Baruch read in the quarters of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, in the upper courtyard at the entry of the New Gate to the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When Micaiah son of Gemariah heard it, 12he went down to the secretary's office in the king's palace. The officials were sitting there—Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and the others. 13He told them what he heard Baruch reading to the people. 14They sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah (son of Shelemiah son of Cushi) to Baruch and said, "Bring the scroll you read to the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When they heard it, they turned in fear to one another and said to Baruch, "We have to report this to the king. 17Tell us how you wrote this. Did Jeremiah dictate it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The officials said, "Both of you, go hide. Don't tell anybody where you are."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> So they reported to the king what it said, but they'd deposited the scroll in the office of Elishama the secretary. 21He sent Jehudi to get it, and he read it to the king and the officials standing beside him. 22The king was sitting in the winter palace in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier beside him. 23When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe's knife and throw them in the brazier till he'd burned up the whole scroll. 24The king and his attendants weren't afraid and didn't tear their clothes. 25Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with him not to burn the scroll, he did it anyway. 26He told Jerahmeel the king's son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah; but the LORD hid them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah 28"Take another scroll and write down everything again. 29Say to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, 'You burned this scroll and said, "Why did you write that the king of Babylon will destroy this land and empty out its people and animals?" 30This is the LOR's answer: 'You won't have any descendant to sit on David's throne. They'll toss your dead body out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. 31I'll punish you, your family, and your attendants for your sins. I'll bring on you and the people in Jerusalem and Judah the catastrophe I've declared—but they didn't listen.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> So Jeremiah gave Baruch another scroll, and dictated everything Jehoiakim had burned, and added similar messages.</span>
