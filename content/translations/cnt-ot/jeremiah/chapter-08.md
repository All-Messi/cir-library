## Jeremiah Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD says, "At that time, they'll bring out of their graves the bones of Judah's kings, its officials, priests, prophets, and the people of Jerusalem. 2They'll spread them out to the sun, moon, and stars, which they've loved, served, and worshiped. They won't be gathered up or buried. They'll be like manure on the ground. 3The remnant of this evil family will chose death rather than life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Why then do my people, Jerusalem,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I've been listening to what they're saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Even a stork in the sky knows when to migrate;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The wise are put to shame;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So I'll give their wives to other people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They try to bandage over my people's wounds					by saying, 'Everything's all right,' when it's not. 13"When I snatch them away,										there won't be any grapes left on the vine								or figs on the tree,											and their leaves will wither;									what I've given them will be gone."						14Why are we sitting here?									Let's get to fortified cities to die;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> We looked for peace, but it didn't come;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> From Dan we can hear the horses snorting;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> My sorrow can't be healed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Listen! It's my people's outcry from a distant land:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I'm hurting for my people's hurt;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Isn't there any salve in Gilead?</span>
