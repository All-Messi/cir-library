## Jeremiah Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, his brothers and sons—the whole family of Rechabites—4to the LORD's Temple to the office for the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God. It was close to the officials' quarters, above the room for Maaseiah son of Shallum, the doorkeeper. 5I put pitchers of wine and cups in front of the Rechabites, "Have a drink!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But they said, "We won't drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab/Jehonadab son of Rechab told us, 'Never drink wine, you or your descendants, forever. 7Don't build houses, sow seed, plant vineyards, or own them. Live in tents so you'll live a long time in the land.' 8We, our wives, sons, and daughters have obeyed him. 9We don't build houses or own vineyards, fields, or seed. 10We live in tents. 11But when Nebuchadnezzar invaded the land, we came to Jerusalem before the Babylonian and Syrian armies got here. So we've been living in Jerusalem."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then a message from the LORD came to Jeremiah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, "Tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, 'Won't you receive instruction and listen to me? 14The descendants of Jonadab still observe his command not to drink wine. I've spoken to you time and again, but you've ignored me. 15I've sent you prophets time and again and said, "Turn from your sinful way, correct your deeds, don't go after other gods so you can live in the land I've given you and your ancestors." But you've ignored me. 16Jonadab's descendants have observed their ancestor's command, but you've ignored me. 17So, I'm bringing on Judah and Jerusalem the disaster I've threatened.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Jeremiah told the Rechabites, "The LORD of Hosts says, 'Because you've obeyed Jonadab, 19he'll always have descendants to serve me.'"</span>
