## Jeremiah Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Nobles send servants to draw water,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The ground is cracked</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Does out in the country</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Donkeys stand on the barren hills</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The people say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Israel's Hope, our Savior in distress,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Why are you like someone overwhelmed,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The LORD answers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD told me, "Don't pray for them. 12I'll ignore their outcry when they fast. When they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I won't accept them. I'll put an end to them with sword, famine, and disease."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But I said, "Lord GOD, the prophets are telling them they won't see sword or famine, that you'll give them lasting peace here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He answered, "The prophets are prophesying falsely in my name. I haven't spoken to them. They're prophesying false visions, worthless fortunetelling, the deceptions in their own minds. 15Though I haven't sent them, they keep saying there won't be sword or famine here. So they'll meet their end by sword and famine! 16The people they're prophesying to will be victims thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem. There won't be anybody to bury them, their wives, or children. I'll pour out their own wickedness on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> If I go out in the country,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Have you completely rejected Judah?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> We know we're ungodly, LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> For your own reputation, don't despise us;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Can any nation's idols bring rain?</span>
