## Jeremiah Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> That same year in the fifth month, fourth year of Zedekiah's reign, Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the LORD's Temple with the priests and the people standing there: 2"The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, 'I've broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 3Within two years I'll bring back the articles from the LORD's Temple that Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon.  4I'll also bring back Jeconiah, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah that went to Babylon. I'll break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jeremiah answered him, 6"Amen! May the LORD do just that! Bring back the articles and exiles from Babylon! 7But listen to what I'm telling you! 8For centuries, the prophets have prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms about war, catastrophe, and disease. 9A prophet that predicts a peace that actually comes, is one the LORD has actually sent."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Hananiah grabbed the yoke off Jeremiah's neck and broke it. 11He told the people, "The LORD says, 'In the same way, two years from now I'll break Nebuchadnezzar's yoke from off the neck of all the nations.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah 13"Go tell Hananiah that the LORD says, 'You've broken a wooden yoke, but I've replaced it with an iron one 14on those nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar. I've even given him the wild animals.' 15"Hananiah, the LORD didn't send you. You made the people believe a lie. 16So he says you're going to die this year because you've advised rebellion against him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Hananiah died two months later in the seventh month.</span>
