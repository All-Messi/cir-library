## Jeremiah Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Judah's sin is recorded with an iron stylus;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> As well as they remember their children,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My mountain in the open country,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You'll voluntarily let go of the inheritance I gave you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They're like a tamarisk shrub in the desert</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Fortunate are the people that trust in the LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They're like a tree planted by water</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I, the LORD, search hearts and test minds</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> People that make a fortune unjustly</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> From the beginning, our sanctuary</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> LORD, hope of Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> LORD, I'll be healed if you heal me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They keep asking to me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But I haven't hurried away from serving as your shepherd;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don't be a terror to me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Disgrace those who harass me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The LORD told me, "Go stand in the gate that Judah's kings use, and in the other gates around Jerusalem. 20Say, 'Listen to the LORD's message, Judah, kings of Judah, people living in Jerusalem who use these gates: 21For your own good, don't carry any load on the Sabbath or bring anything in through these gates. 22Don't carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath or work. Set the Sabbath aside like I told your ancestors. 23But they stiffened their necks and wouldn't follow directions. 24"'Listen carefully and don't carry any load through this city's gates on the Sabbath. Set it aside by resting on it. 25Then through these gates will come kings and officials who sit on David's throne, who ride in chariots and on horses, people of Judah and Jerusalem. People will live in this city permanently. 26They'll come in from the towns in Judah and places around Jerusalem, from Benjamin, the western foothills, the hill country, and the Negev. They'll bring thanksgiving sacrifices to the LORD's Temple. 27If you don't set the Sabbath aside, I'll light a fire in Jerusalem's gates. It will spread to the palaces in Jerusalem, and it won't be put out.'"</span>
