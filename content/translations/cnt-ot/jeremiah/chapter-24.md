## Jeremiah Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Nebuchadrezzar/Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon Jeconiah/Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials in Judah along with the craftsmen and artisans. Then the LORD showed me two baskets of figs sitting in front of the Temple. 2One basket had nice figs in it, like first-ripe ones; the other basket held rotten ones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He said, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs, really good ones and really bad ones you can't eat because they're rotten."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then his message came to me: 5"The LORD God of Israel says, 'Like those good figs, I'll treat as good the captives of Judah that I've sent out to Babylonia. 6I'll tend to them and bring them back. I'll build them up, not tear them down; plant them, not pull them up. 7I'll give them a heart to know me because I'm the LORD. They'll be my people, and I'll be their God. They'll come back to me with all their heart. 8'But like those bad figs, I'll treat Zedekiah, his officials, the remnant in Jerusalem, and the ones living in Egypt. 9I'll make them something every kingdom can see: a disgrace, a byword, a taunt, a curse wherever I scatter them. 10I'll send them sword, famine, and disease till they're gone from the land I gave them and their ancestors.'"</span>
