## Jeremiah Chapter 37

### Jeremiah Imprisoned

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Zedekiah son of Josiah, that Nebuchadnezzar had appointed as king in Judah, ruled in place of Coniah son of Jehoiakim. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But he, his attendants, and the people that were left ignored what the LORD said through Jeremiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah to say, <em>“Pray to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> our God on our behalf.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jeremiah was still moving freely among the people because they hadn’t put him in prison yet. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Meantime, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt. When the Babylonians besieging Jerusalem heard about that, they lifted the siege.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>“Tell</em><em> the king that sent you to inquire from me, ‘Pharaoh</em><em>’s</em><em> army </em><em>that‘</em><em>s come out to </em><em>help</em><em> you will go back to Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>Babylonians</em><em> will</em><em> come back and attack this city, capture </em><em>and burn it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> </em><em>deceive</em><em> yourselves</em><em> into thinking they’ll leave. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Even</em><em> if you’d defeated the whole </em><em>Babylonia</em><em>n army and only </em><em>the </em><em>wounded </em><em>were </em><em>left in their tents, they’</em><em>d get up and burn the city.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When the Babylonian army lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Jeremiah left Jerusalem for the territory of Benjamin to take over some property there. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>At the Benjamin Gate, a sentry named Irijah (son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah) arrested him, claiming he was deserting to the Babylonians!<em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Jeremiah denied it,<em> </em>but he wouldn’t listen. He arrested him and took him to the officials. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They were mad at Jeremiah, and beat him and put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they’d converted into a prison.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 37:6-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When he’d been in the dungeon many days, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>King Zedekiah secretly brought him to his palace to ask him if<em> </em>any message had come from the LORD.<em> </em> <em>“</em><em>Yes</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>You’ll be turned over to </em><em>the</em><em> king of Babylon!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>How</em><em> have I sinned against you, your attendants, or the people that you’ve put me in prison? </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Where</em><em> are your prophets now that said the king of Babylon wouldn’t attack you or this land? </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> listen now, my lord the king. Don’t put me back in Jonathan’s house to die</em>.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> King Zedekiah commanded them to commit him to the courtyard of the guard. They gave him a loaf of bread each day from the bakers’ street till the bread in the city ran out. So he remained in the courtyard of the guard.</span>
