## Jeremiah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wander back and forth in the streets in Jerusalem;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Although they swear, 'As sure as the LORD lives,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> LORD, aren't you looking for honesty?						You've struck them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then I said, "They're poor and foolish,							because they don't know the way of the LORD								or the ordinance of their God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'll go to their leaders and speak to them;									surely they know the way of the LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So a lion from the woods will kill them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They were well-fed, lusty stallions,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Won't I punish them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Israel and Judah have dealt deviously with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They've misjudged me and said,									'He won't do anything;											misfortune won't fall on us;										we won't see sword or famine.							13His prophets are windbags; they don't have any message from him.'						Indeed, those things will happen to them!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So the LORD God of hosts says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll bring a distant nation against you, Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Their quiver is like an open grave;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They'll eat your harvest and your food,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yet even at that time," the LORD says, "I won't destroy you completely. 19When they say, 'Why has the LORD our God done this to us?' tell them, 'As you've left me and served foreign gods in your country, so you'll serve foreigners in someone else's country.' 21'Foolish, senseless people, listen to this,								you that have eyes, but don't see,											and ears, but don't hear,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You're not going to respect me?									You're not going to tremble in my presence?'"										the LORD says.        	    	Jer 5:20-22a "I've made sand a boundary for the ocean,									an eternal decree it can't cross;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But my people have a stubborn, rebellious heart;							they've turned aside and left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They don't say in their hearts,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Your iniquities have deprived you of those things;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Sinners among my people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Like cages full of birds,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They're healthy and sleek,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Won't I punish them?</span>
