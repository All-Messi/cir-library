## Jeremiah Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oh that my head was a body of water</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I wish I had an inn in the desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They all deceive their friends;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They live in deceit;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So he says:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Their tongues are deadly arrows that deceive;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Am I not going to punish them for such things</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'll make Jerusalem a pile of ruins, a den for jackals,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is the LORD talking to that can pass it on? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert nobody travels through? 13The LORD answers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They've followed Baal and their stubborn heart</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So I'll feed them bitter plants to eat</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll scatter them among nations</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The LORD of Hosts says:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Have them hurry and raise up wailing for us</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> There is wailing in Zion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Listen to the LORD's message, women;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Death has come up into our windows</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Say, "The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Instead, they need to take pride 25"The time's coming when I'll punish everyone that's circumcised in body but not in heart—26Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and the ones in the desert that cut the corners of their hair.</span>
