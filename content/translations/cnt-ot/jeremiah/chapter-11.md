## Jeremiah Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah 2"Listen to this covenant and tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem 3that the LORD God of Israel says, 'People are under a curse who ignore the covenant 4that I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, the iron furnace. I said, "If you listen to what I'm telling you, you'll be my people, and I'll be your God."  5Doing what I tell you confirms the oath I swore to give you a land flowing with milk and honey, like it is now.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He told me, "Deliver this message in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, 'Do what the covenant says. 7From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt till now, I solemnly and persistently warned them to listen to me, 8but they didn't. They followed their own stubborn hearts. So I brought on them what the terms of the covenant warned would happen if they didn't keep it.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then the LORD said, "I've found mutiny among the people in Judah and Jerusalem. 10They've returned to their ancestors' sins by going after other gods. Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their forefathers. 11So I'm going to bring a disaster they can't escape. Even if they call out to me, I'll ignore them. 12Then the towns in Judah and the people in Jerusalem will call out to the gods they burn incense to, but they won't save them when disaster comes. 13Judah, you have as many gods as towns. You have as many incense altars to Baal as you have streets in Jerusalem. 14"So, Jeremiah, don't pray for my people or lift up a cry for them in this disaster. 15What right does my beloved have to live in my house when she's done so many disgusting things? Can sacrificing meat make her disaster go away and make her happy?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The LORD once called you a green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form. With the noise of a great fury, he's set it on fire and burned up its branches. 17Israel and Judah, the LORD of Hosts that planted you has pronounced disaster on you because you've provoked him by burning incense to Baal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> LORD, I found out from you their plots against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I was like a gentle lamb led to slaughter;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But, LORD of Hosts, who judges justly,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So this is what the LORD says about the ones in Anathoth that tell me they'll kill me if I prophesy in his name:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> None of them will survive the disaster</span>
