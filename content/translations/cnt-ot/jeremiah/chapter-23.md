## Jeremiah Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This is what the LORD God of Israel says about shepherds that scatter and destroy his sheep instead of tending to them, "I'm about to tend to you for the evil you've done. 3But I'll gather the remnant of my flock out of the countries where I've driven them, and bring them back to their pasture to reproduce and multiply. 4I'll raise up shepherds to tend them. They won't be afraid anymore, and none of them will go missing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In his time Judah will be safe;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> People won't swear then, 'As sure as the LORD lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.' 8They'll swear, 'As sure as the LORD lives who brought Israel's descendants back from the north countries where he'd banished them.' They'll live again on their own land."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> As for the false prophets:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The country is full of adultery;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So their road will be a slippery path in the dark</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Now I've seen something horrible about the prophets in Jerusalem;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So this is what the LORD says about the prophets:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The LORD of Hosts says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They keep telling those who despise me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But who has stood in the council of the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> An angry storm has gone out like a tornado,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The LORD's anger won't let up</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> If they'd stood in my council,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Can anybody hide from me? 25"I've heard what the false prophets have lied in my name, 'I have dreamed! I have dreamed!' 26How long will they prophesy lies from their imagination, 27and try to get my people to forget me by telling dreams to one another like their ancestors who forgot me for Baal? 28The prophet that has a dream can go ahead and tell it, but he must tell my message faithfully. Straw's different from wheat. 29My word is like fire, like a sledgehammer that breaks rock into pieces. 30I'm against prophets that steal messages from one another 31and claim I said it, 32that prophesy lying dreams and mislead my people so recklessly. They're no benefit them at all. 33"When a prophet, priest, or layman asks you, 'What's the LORD's burden?' tell him he's the burden, and the LORD is going to throw him off. 34Any prophet, priest, or layman that says, 'The LORD's burden,' I'll punish along with his family. 35You're to ask your brother and fellow citizen, 'What has the LORD answered?' 'What has the LORD said?' 36Don't use the expression 'the LORD's burden' anymore; that 'burden' is nothing but somebody's own idea that perverts the message from the living God, the LORD of Hosts, our God. 37So ask the prophet, 'What has the LORD answered you?' 'What has the LORD said?' 38If you say, 'The LORD's burden,' 39I'll throw you away with the city I gave you and your ancestors. 40I'll permanently disgrace you.'"</span>
