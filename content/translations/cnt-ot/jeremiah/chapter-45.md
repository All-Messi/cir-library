## Jeremiah Chapter 45

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Message Jeremiah Spoke to Baruch 2"This is what the LORD God of Israel says to you, Baruch: 3'You said, "Misfortune awaits me! The LORD has added sorrow to pain. I'm exhausted from groaning. I can't sleep."' 4Tell him the LORD says, 'What I've built up I'm about to tear down. What I've planted I'm about to uproot—the whole land. 5Are you anticipating great things for yourself? Don't. I'm going to bring disaster on everybody, but I'll give you your life as a reward of war wherever you go.'"</span>
