<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> People of Benjamin, get out of Jerusalem!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'll destroy attractive, delicate Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Get ready for war with it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So get up! Let's attack at night</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD of Hosts says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As a well keeps its water fresh,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jerusalem, pay attention to the warning,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The LORD of Hosts says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> How should I warn them?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But I'm full of the LORD's anger;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Their houses will pass on to other people,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> That's because every one's greedy								from least to greatest;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They try to bandage over my people's wounds</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Are they ashamed of their disgusting acts?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The LORD said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I posted a watchman over you and said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Listen, earth; I'm going to bring disaster on them,						a disaster that results from their intentions,							because they ignored me									and wouldn't accept my Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Why offer me frankincense from Sheba</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They take up bow and spear;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> We've heard the report about them; our hands hang limp;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don't go out in the field or walk on the road,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Put on burlap, my people, and roll in ashes;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They're stubborn and rebellious,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The bellows blow fiercely,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Assay them as 'rejected silver'</span>
