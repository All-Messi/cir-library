## Jeremiah Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I got down to his shop, he was there, working at his wheel. 4But the jar he was making with his hands didn't come out the way he wanted; so he made another one out of it that he was satisfied with.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then the LORD's message came to me: 6"Israel, can't I deal with you like this potter did? You're like clay in my hands. 7At one time I might talk about uprooting, tearing down, or destroying a nation. 8If it turns from its sin, I'll relent. 9At another time I might talk about planting it or building it up. 10If it doesn't obey, I'll change my mind about the good I was going to do for it. 11So tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, 'I'm preparing a catastrophe for you. Turn back from your sinful lives, every one of you. Reform your ways and deeds.' 12"But they say, 'We're not going to do that! We're going to make our own plans and do what we want to!'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Does the snow in Lebanon ever leave</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> My people have forgotten me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They end up making their land desolate,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll scatter them ahead of their enemies like an east wind</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then they said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Should people repay good with bad?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So let their children starve;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> May they scream in their houses</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> LORD, you know about their deadly designs against me.</span>
