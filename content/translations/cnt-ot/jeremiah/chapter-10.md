<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Their customs are delusions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber patch.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> There's none like you, LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who wouldn't respect you, King of nations?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But their instruction is completely foolish;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> People bring beaten silver from Tarshish</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But the LORD is a real God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Tell them this: "The gods that didn't make earth and sky</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He's the One that made the earth by his power,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When he speaks, there's thunder in the rain above;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Every mortal is stupid and ignorant;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They're worthless objects to ridicule;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jacob's portion is not like them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Pick up your baggage,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I'm hurt and my wound can't heal;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> My tent's destroyed;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The shepherds don't use any sense;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> There's a loud uproar in the north</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I know, LORD, that we don't set our own way;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Correct me, but in due measure,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Pour out your anger on nations that don't know you,</span>
