## Jeremiah Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message to Jeremiah from the LORD 2"Make yokes and straps and put them on your neck. 3Send back a message to the kings of Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, Tyre, and Sidon by the couriers that come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah. 4Have them tell their masters, 'The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, 5"By my power I made the world, its people and animals. I'll give it to whoever pleases me. 6I've given these countries to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant. I've even given him the wild animals. 7Every nation will serve him, his son, and his grandson till the time when many nations and great kings make him and his land their servant. 8"Any kingdom that doesn't surrender and put its neck under his yoke, I'll punish with sword, famine, and disease. 9Don't listen to prophets, fortunetellers, dreamers, soothsayers, and sorcerers that tell you not to surrender; 10they're lying. You'll be exiled and perish. 11But a nation that puts its neck under his yoke, I'll let remain on its land, cultivate it, and keep living there."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I told Zedekiah, king of Judah, "Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon. Surrender and you'll stay alive! 13Why die by sword, famine, and disease like the LORD warned any nation that wouldn't serve him? 14-15I didn't send the prophets that tell you otherwise. They're prophesying falsely in my name. As a result, I'll drive you out; you and those prophets will perish."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I told the priests and the people, "The LORD says not to listen to prophets that tell you the articles from the Temple will soon come back from Babylon. 17Surrender and you'll stay alive! Why let this city become a ruin? 18If those prophets have the LORD's message, let them ask him that the articles still in his Temple not go to Babylon. 19The LORD of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the stands, the articles still in this city—20things Nebuchadnezzar didn't take when he exiled Jeconiah and the nobles in Judah and Jerusalem—[21] 22'He'll take them to Babylon till I go and bring them back.'"</span>
