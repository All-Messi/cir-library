## Jeremiah Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You render justice, LORD,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You planted them and they took root;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But, LORD, you know me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How long will the land mourn</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Even the members of your own family</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> My permanent possession has roared at me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Is my inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They've made it desolate;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Destroying armies have come</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They've sown wheat and reaped thorns;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> This is what the LORD says about neighboring nations that strike at my people's inheritance: "I'm about to uproot them from their lands along with Judah. 15But afterward I'll relent and bring these nations back to their territories. 16Then, if they'll learn to swear by me, 'As sure as the Lord lives,' like they taught my people to swear by Baal, I'll let them live among my people. 17But any nation that won't listen, I'll uproot and destroy."</span>
