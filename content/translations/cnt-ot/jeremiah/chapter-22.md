## Jeremiah Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The LORD says, "Go to the king's palace in Judah and say, 2'Listen to this message from the LORD, king of Judah on David's throne—you, your officials, and your people that come in these gates. 3"Be just and good. Deliver from their oppressors those who've been robbed. Don't mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, or shed innocent blood here.  4If you do that, kings who sit on David's throne will come in these palace gates with attendants riding in chariots and on horses. 5If you won't, I swear by myself that this palace will be empty."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He says this about the king of Judah's palace:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll send destroyers against you with their weapons 8"Nations will pass this city and say, 'Why did the LORD do that to this great city?' 9People will answer, 'Because they abandoned his covenant with them and served other gods.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> This is what the LORD says about Shallum/Jehoahaz son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father and was exiled from here: his upper rooms with injustice:								he made his countrymen work for him for nothing;							14he said, 'I'll build myself a grand palace									      with large upper rooms, 									            cut out windows for it,											panel it with cedar,											and paint it red.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Do you think you're a king because you traffic in cedar?					Didn't your father eat and drink,									do justice and goodness?									Things went well for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He defended the poor and needy;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But you have eyes and heart									only for your own dishonest gain,								for shedding innocent blood,									for practicing oppression and violence."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So the LORD says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They won't mourn for him, as in								'My master' or 'He had such splendor!'							19They'll bury him like a donkey,								dragged off and thrown out of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Go up to Lebanon and cry out;									shout in Bashan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I spoke to you in your prosperity;								but you said, 'I don't have to do that!'							That's the way you've acted since you were young.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The wind will blow your allies away;								your buddies will go into captivity.							Your sinfulness will disgrace you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You that live nested in cedars from Lebanon,							how you'll groan when pangs come on you								like a woman in childbirth! 24"As I live," the LORD says, "even if you, Coniah/Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I'd pull you off 25and hand you to the executioners you dread: Nebuchadrezzar/Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. 26I'll expel you and your mother from your native land. 27You won't return to the land you'll yearn to see. 28"Why is Coniah/Jehoiachin a despised, shattered pot,						an unwanted container?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Land, land, land,										listen to the LORD's message: 30'Let the records show that this man had no children;							he was a failure in his own time.</span>
