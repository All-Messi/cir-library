## Jeremiah Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD says, <em>“</em><em>Go to the king’s </em><em>palace</em><em> in Judah and say, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>‘Listen</em><em> to </em><em>this</em><em> message from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, king of Judah on David’</em><em>s throne—</em><em>you, your </em><em>official</em><em>s, and your people that </em><em>come</em><em> in these gates.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Be</em><em> just and good. Deliver from their oppressors those who’ve been robbed. Don’t mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, or shed innocent blood here.  </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you do that, kings who sit on David’s throne will come </em><em>in</em><em> these palace gates with attendants riding in chariots and on horses. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you won’t, I swear by myself that this palace will be empty.”’” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> his time Judah will be </em><em>safe;</em> <em>	</em><em>	Israel will live safely.</em> <em>	They’ll call him </em><em>Yahvwh</em><em> Our Goodness.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><strong><em>People</em></strong><strong><em> won’t swear then, ‘As sure as the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.’ </em></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><em>They’ll</em></strong><strong><em> swear, ‘As sure as the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>lives who brought Israel’s descendants back from the north countries where he’d banished them.’ </em></strong><strong><em>They’ll live again on their own land.”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>            </strong></span>

### Message About False Prophets


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>As for the false prophets: My heart’s broken; my body’s shaking; I’m like someone drunk on wine because of the LORD and his holy message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The country is full of adultery; it languishes under a curse. The pastures have dried up; <em>the prophets</em> all do evil; they misuse their authority.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:9-10</p>

### 11“Prophet and priest are ungodly; 	I’ve found their wickedness right in my Temple.


<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>This is what the LORD says about Shallum/<em>Jehoahaz</em> son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father and was exiled from here: <em>“He’s never coming </em><em>back;</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> their road will be a slippery path in the dark</em> <em>	where they’ll be driven and </em><em>fall down</em><em>.</em> <em>I’ll bring catastrophe on them</em> <em>	when I punish them.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:11-12</p>

### 13“I’ve seen something offensive about the prophets in Samaria; 	they’ve prophesied by Baal and misled my people.


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><em>Now</em><em> I’ve seen something horrible about the prophets in </em><em>Jerusalem;</em> <em>	they’ve committed adultery and followed lies.</em> <em>They encourage the ones that do evil,</em> <em>	</em><em>so</em><em> nobody turns back from sin.</em> <em>They’ve become like Sodom</em><em> </em><em>to me,</em> <em>	like the people in Gomorrah.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> this is what the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says about the prophets:</em> <em>	</em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>I’</em></strong><strong><em>ll</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>feed</em></strong><strong><em> them bitter plants</em></strong><strong><em> to eat</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and </em></strong><strong><em>give them</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>poisoned water to drink</em></strong><em>,</em> <em>	because the prophets in Jerusalem</em> <em>	</em><em>	have spread ungodliness in the land.’”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:13-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>The LORD of Hosts says, <em>	“Ignore your </em><em>prophets;</em> <em>	</em><em>	they’re giving you false hopes.</em> <em>	They talk to you about visions they imagine,</em> <em>	</em><em>	not visions from me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><em>They</em><em> keep telling those who despise me</em> <em>	that the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> has said they’ll have </em><em>peace;</em> <em>they say to the ones who follow their own stubborn heart</em> <em>	 that catastrophe won’t happen to them.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup><em>But</em><em> who has stood in the council of the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em> <em>	to see and hear his message?</em> <em>	Who has paid attention to what he says?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><em>An</em><em> angry storm has gone out like a tornado,</em> <em>	like a micro-burst on the heads of sinners.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> anger won’t let up</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>till he’s carried out his intentions.</em> <em>Later, you’ll understand.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:16-20</p>

### 21“I didn’t send those prophets;  		yet they hurried to deliver their ideas; 	I didn’t speak to them;  		yet they kept on prophesying.


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> spoke to you in your prosperity;</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	but you said, ‘I don’t have to do that!’</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	That’s the way you’ve acted since you were young.</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 22:18-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup><em>If</em><em> they’d stood in my council,</em> <em>	they would’ve delivered my message </em> <em>	and turned back from their own ways and deeds.</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“Am</em><em> I a God that’s close by </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>and not one that’s far off?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><em>You</em><em> that live nested in cedars from Lebanon,</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	how you’ll groan when pangs come on you</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	like a woman in childbirth!</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em> <strong>Message About Jehoiachin</strong> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“As</em><em> I live,” </em>the LORD says,<em> “even if you, </em><em>Coniah/</em>Jehoiachin<em> son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I’d pull you off </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> hand you to the executioners you dread: Nebuchadrezzar/</em>Nebuchadnezzar<em> and the Babylonians. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> expel you and your mother from your native land. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> won’t return to the land you’ll yearn to see. </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 22:22-27</p>

### 28“Why is Coniah/Jehoiachin a despised, shattered pot,						an unwanted container?							 Why have he and his descendants been expelled							into a foreign country?


<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Can</em><em> anybody hide from me?</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>Don’t I fill</em><em> earth and sky? </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:21-24</p>

### 25“I’ve heard what the false prophets have lied in my name, ‘I have dreamed! I have dreamed!’ 26How long will they prophesy lies from their imagination, 27and try to get my people to forget me by telling dreams to one another like their ancestors who forgot me for Baal? 28The prophet that has a dream can go ahead and tell it, but he must tell my message faithfully. Straw’s different from wheat. 29My word is like fire, like a sledgehammer that breaks rock into pieces. 30I’m against prophets that steal messages from one another 31and claim I said it, 32that prophesy lying dreams and mislead my people so recklessly. They’re no benefit them at all.  	Jer 23:25-32 33“When a prophet, priest, or layman asks you, ‘What’s the LORD’s burden?’ tell him he’s the burden, and the LORD is going to throw him off. 34Any prophet, priest, or layman that says, ‘The LORD’s burden,’ I’ll punish along with his family. 35You’re to ask your brother and fellow citizen, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ ‘What has the LORD said?’ 36Don’t use the expression ‘the LORD’s burden’ anymore; that ‘burden’ is nothing but somebody’s own idea that perverts the message from the living God, the LORD of Hosts, our God. 37So ask the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ ‘What has the LORD said?’ 38If you say, ‘The LORD’s burden,’ 39I’ll throw you away with the city I gave you and your ancestors. 40I’ll permanently disgrace you.’” 	      Jer 23:33-40	        Two Baskets of Figs


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup><em>Land</em><em>, land, land,</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	listen to </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s</em><em> message:</em><em>	</em><em> </em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>‘Let</em><em> the records show that this man had no children;</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	he was a failure in his own time.</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em> <em>He won’t have a descendant to succeed him</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	on David’s throne in Judah.’”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 22:28-30</p>

### The Righteous Branch 23:[1] 2This is what the LORD God of Israel says about shepherds that scatter and destroy his sheep instead of tending to them, “I’m about to tend to you for the evil you’ve done. 3But I’ll gather the remnant of my flock out of the countries where I’ve driven them, and bring them back to their pasture to reproduce and multiply. 4I’ll raise up shepherds to tend them. They won’t be afraid anymore, and none of them will go missing. 		5“The time’s coming 			 when I’ll raise up a good Branch for David; 	he’ll reign as King, deal wisely, 		and carry out justice and goodness in the land.
