## Jeremiah Chapter 52

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Zedekiah was 21 when he became king and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 2He did all the evil Jehoiakim had done. 3Because of the LORD's anger over that, he put Jerusalem and Judah out of his presence. Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon. 4The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, Nebuchadnezzar came with his army, set up camp against Jerusalem, and built a siege wall around it. 5The city lay under siege till Zedekiah's eleventh year. 6The ninth day, fourth month, the famine was so severe in the city that the people didn't have any food left. 7Then they broke into the city, and the fighting men fled at night through the gate between the two walls by the king's garden, even though the Babylonians were all around the city. They went toward the Arabah, 8but the Babylonian army overtook the king in the plains by Jericho. His whole army scattered from him. 9They captured him and took him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 10He executed Zedekiah's sons right in front of him and executed the officials of Judah. 11Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with bronze bonds, and took him to Babylon. He put him in prison till his death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The tenth day, fifth month, nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, captain of the king of Babylon's bodyguard, came to Jerusalem. 13He burned the LORD's Temple, the king's palace, the houses in Jerusalem, and the important buildings. 14The Babylonian army tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 15Nebuzaradan took into exile some of the poorest people, people left in the city, those who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans. 16He left some destitute to dress grapevines and plow fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The Babylonians broke in pieces the bronze pillars in front of the LORD's Temple, the stands, and the bronze sea; and carried their bronze to Babylon. 18They took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, basins, pans—all the bronze articles for the Temple service. 19The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, firepans, basins, pots, lampstands, dishes for incense and liquid offering bowls, what was gold and fine silver. 20The 2 pillars, the sea, the 12 bronze bulls under the sea, and the stands King Solomon had made for the LORD's Temple—the bronze in all those items was too much to weigh. 21Each pillar was 27ft tall and 18ft in circumference—4 fingers thick and hollow. 22The bronze capital on each pillar was 7½ft high, with bronze network and pomegranates all around it. 23There were 96 pomegranates on the sides—100 altogether.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, 27and the king put them to death there in Hamath. So they led Judah away into exile.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> The twenty-fifth day, twelfth month, thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's exile, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, was gracious to Jehoiachin and brought him out of prison. 32He was kind to him and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings that were with him in Babylon. 33So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and had his meals with the king regularly 34till his death.</span>
