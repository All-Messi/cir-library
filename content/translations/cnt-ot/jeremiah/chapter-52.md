## Jeremiah Chapter 52

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Zedekiah was 21 when he became king and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He did all the evil Jehoiakim had done. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Because of the LORD’s anger over that, he put Jerusalem and Judah out of his presence. Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The <strong>tenth day, tenth month, ninth year of </strong><strong><em>Zedekiah’s</em></strong><strong> reign,</strong> Nebuchadnezzar came with his army, set up camp against Jerusalem, and built a siege wall around it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The city lay under siege till <strong>Zedekiah’s eleventh year.</strong> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The <strong>ninth day, fourth month,</strong> the famine was so severe in the city that the people didn’t have any food left. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then they broke into the city, and the fighting men fled at night through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden, even though the Babylonians were all around the city. They went toward the Arabah, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>but the Babylonian army overtook the king in the plains by Jericho. His whole army scattered from him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They captured him and took him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He executed Zedekiah’s sons right in front of him and executed the officials of Judah. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze bonds, and took him to Babylon. He put him in prison till his death.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### The Temple Burned


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The <strong>tenth day, fifth month, nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar</strong>, Nebuzaradan, captain of the king of Babylon’s bodyguard, came to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He burned the LORD’s Temple, the king’s palace, the houses in Jerusalem, and the important buildings. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The Babylonian army tore down the walls around Jerusalem. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Nebuzaradan took into exile some of the poorest people, people left in the city, those who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He left some destitute to dress grapevines and plow fields. <strong>                  </strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The Babylonians broke in pieces the bronze pillars in front of the LORD’s Temple, the stands, and the bronze sea; and carried their bronze to Babylon. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, basins, pans—all the bronze articles for the Temple service. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, firepans, basins, pots, lampstands, dishes for incense and liquid offering bowls, what was gold and fine silver. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The 2 pillars, the sea, the 12 bronze bulls under the sea, and the stands King Solomon had made for the LORD’s Temple—the bronze in all those items was too much to weigh. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Each pillar was 27ft tall and 18ft in circumference—4 fingers thick and hollow. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The bronze capital on each pillar was 7½ft high, with bronze network and pomegranates all around it. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>There were 96 pomegranates on the sides—100 altogether. <strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>and the king put them to death there in Hamath. So they led Judah away into exile.</span>
