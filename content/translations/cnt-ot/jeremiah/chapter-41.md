## Jeremiah Chapter 41

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama from the royal family and a chief officer of the king, along with 10 men, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. While they were eating there, 2Ishmael and the 10 men got up and struck down Gedaliah with the sword. 3He struck down the Jews that were with Gedaliah as well as the Babylonian soldiers there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The next day, before anybody knew what had happened, 580 men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria with their beards shaved off, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed. They had grain offerings and incense to present at the LORD's Temple. 6Ishmael went out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, "Come in to Gedaliah." 7But as soon as they came in the city, he and the men killed them and threw them in a cistern. 8But 10 of them said to Ishmael, "Don't kill us. We have stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey stashed in the field" so he didn't kill them. 9The cistern that Ishmael filled with corpses was the one King Asa had made because of Baasha, king of Israel. 10Then he took captive everybody left in Mizpah, the king's daughters, and the remaining people that Nebuzaradan had put under Gedaliah's charge. He set out with them to cross over to the Ammonites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But Johanan son of Kareah and his commanders heard what Ishmael had done. 12So they took all the men and went to fight him; they found him by the large pool in Gibeon. 13When the people with Ishmael saw Johanan and his commanders, they were happy. 14So the ones Ishmael had taken captive defected to Johanan. 15But Ishmael escaped from Johanan with 8 men and went to the Ammonites. 16Johanan and his commanders took from Mizpah the remnant of the people he'd recovered from Ishmael—the soldiers, the women, children, and eunuchs. 17They went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, near Bethlehem, with the intention of going to Egypt. 18They were afraid of the Babylonians since Ishmael had struck down Gedaliah.</span>
