## Jeremiah Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Pashhur son of Immer, the priest in charge of the LORD's Temple, heard Jeremiah prophesying that, 2he had him beaten and put in stocks at the upper Benjamin Gate of the Temple. 3The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah told him, "The LORD doesn't call you Pashhur, but The Man Surrounded by Terror. 4He says, 'I'm going to make you a terror to yourself and your friends. While you watch, they'll fall by their enemies' sword. I'll turn Judah over to the king of Babylon to carry away and kill. 5I'll turn over this city's wealth, its produce, its expensive things, the treasures of Judah's kings to take to Babylon. 6Pashhur, you, everybody in your house, and the friends you've falsely prophesied for will go into captivity and be buried in Babylon.'"</span>
