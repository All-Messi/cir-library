## Jeremiah Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Words of Jeremiah Son of Hilkiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Messages from the LORD came to him from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah. 3They came as well during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, till the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, till Jerusalem's exile in the fifth month.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A message from the LORD came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But the LORD told me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You don't need to be afraid of them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He reached out and touched my mouth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> A message from the LORD came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Another message came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then he said, "Evil is going to pour out from the north onto the people in this country. 15I'm calling the armies in the kingdoms up north. Each one will set a throne at Jerusalem's gates, against its walls all round, against the towns in Judah. 16I'll render judgment on this nation for leaving me and sacrificing to other gods, for worshiping what they've made with their own hands. 17Gird up your loins. Get up and tell them everything I've told you. Don't let them intimidate you, or I'll dishearten you in front of them. 18Today, I'm making you like a fortified city, like an iron pillar, like bronze walls against the whole land, Judah's kings, officials, priests, and people. 19They'll fight you, but they won't win, because I'm with you."</span>
