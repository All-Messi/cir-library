## Jeremiah Chapter **19**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The LORD says, <em>“Go buy a </em><em>clay pot. T</em><em>ake some elders and senior priests</em><em> </em>along<em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>to</em><em> the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom by the entrance to the Potsherd Gate. Deliver</em><em> </em><em>my</em><em> message</em><em> there, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>‘Listen</em><em> to a message from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em>, kings of Judah and </em><em>people of</em><em> Jerusalem</em><em>. I’m about to bring such </em><em>catastrophe</em><em> here that will make everybody’s ears ring when they hear about it. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> abandoned me and made this a foreign place, and burned sacrifices here to gods that you, your ancestors, and the kings of Judah never knew. You’ve filled it with innocent people’s blood </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> built high places for Baal so you can burn your sons as offerings to him. I never commanded that. Such a thing never even entered my mind! </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> the time’s coming when this place won’t be called </em><em>Topheth</em><em> or </em><em>The Valley of (Ben)Hinnom</em><em>, but </em><em>The Valley of Slaughter</em>.<em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> void the plans that Judah and Jerusalem have. I’ll make them fall by the sword and give their carcasses to buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> city will be desolate, something to gasp at. Everybody that goes by will marvel at its disaster. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> eat their sons and daughters during the siege and distress their enemies bring on them.’</em><strong>       </strong></span>

### 10“Then break the pot in front of the men that go with you. 11Say, ‘The LORD of Hosts says, “Just like a shattered potter’s jug you can’t repair, I’ll shatter this nation and this city. They’ll bury people in Topheth; there won’t be any place else to bury them. [12] 13Their houses, including the kings’ palace, will be defiled like Topheth, because on their roofs they burned sacrifices to the host of heaven and poured out liquid offerings to other gods.”’”


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Jeremiah came back from Topheth and spoke to the people in the court of the LORD’s Temple, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“T</em><em>he</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> of Hosts</em><em>, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’m about to bring on this city and </em><em>surrounding</em><em> towns the entire catastroph</em><em>e I’ve declared against it. You</em><em>’</em><em>ve stiffened your necks and ignored</em><em> </em><em>me</em><em>.’”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
