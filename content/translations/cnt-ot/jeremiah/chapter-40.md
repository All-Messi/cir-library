## Jeremiah Chapter 40

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The captain of the bodyguard took Jeremiah and told him, "The LORD your God declared this catastrophe on this place. 3He brought it on and did what he declared. Because your people sinned against him and ignored him, this happened to youpl. 4But I'm freeing yousg from your chains. If you prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along. I'll take care of you. But if you prefer not to, don't. The whole land is open to you. Go wherever seems right. 5Go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan that the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns in Judah. Stay with him among the people or go somewhere else." So he gave him a ration and a gift, and released him. 6Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah and stayed with him among the people that were left in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The commanders of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah over the land and put him in charge of the men, women, and children, the poorest left in the land. 8So they and their men went to Gedaliah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah; Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite. 9Gedaliah swore to them and their men, "Don't be afraid to serve the Babylonians. If you stay and serve the king of Babylon, you'll survive. 10I'll be at Mizpah to represent you to the Babylonians that come to us. Gather in wine, summer fruit, and oil, and put them in storage containers. Live in the towns you've taken over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and appointed Gedaliah over them. 12They came back to him in Judah and gathered a bumper crop of wine and summer fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Johanan and the commanders of his forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 14and said, "Are you aware that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael to kill you?" But Gedaliah didn't believe it. 15Then Johanan spoke secretly to him, "Let me go kill Ishmael; nobody will know it. Why should he take your life, and the Jews that have gathered to you, get scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But Gedaliah said, "Don't do that. What you're telling me isn't true."</span>
