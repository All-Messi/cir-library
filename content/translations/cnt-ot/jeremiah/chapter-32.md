## Jeremiah Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah in <strong>the Tenth Year of Zedekiah</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> King of Judah</strong> (<strong>Eighteenth Year of Nebuchadnezzar</strong>) <strong>Jeremiah Buys a Field</strong> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Babylon’s army was laying siege to Jerusalem. Zedekiah had shut Jeremiah up in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace, and said, <em>“Why </em><em>do you prophesy that t</em><em>he </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> says, ‘I’m about to give the</em><em> city to the king of Babylon</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Zedekiah</em><em> won’t escape;</em><em> </em><em>the king of Babylon will</em><em> speak to him face t</em><em>o face. </em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>H</em><em>e’ll</em><em> take </em><em>him</em><em> to Babylon</em><em> till I visit him. I</em><em>f you fight the </em><em>Babylonians</em><em>, you</em><em>’ll</em><em> </em><em>lose’?</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jeremiah said, “<em>A message from the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> came to me,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>‘Hanamel</em><em> son of Shallum your uncle is coming to tell you to buy his field in Anathoth; you have first-right to redeem it.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He did come to me in the courtyard of the guard like the LORD said, and told me, <em>“Buy my field at Anathoth in Benjamin. It’s yours to redeem.” </em><strong>	  </strong><strong>Jer 32:1-</strong><strong>8a</strong> Then I knew it was a message from the LORD. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I bought the field from my cousin and weighed out 6.8 oz <sup>17 </sup><sup>shekels</sup> of silver for him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I called in witnesses, signed and sealed the deed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>I took the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, and the unsealed copy, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and gave them to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah in front of Hanamel and the witnesses who signed it in the presence of the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>In front of them I told Baruch, <strong>	</strong><strong>Jer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>32:18b-13</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> After I gave Baruch the deed, I prayed,<em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“Lord</em><em> G</em><em>OD</em><em>, you made earth and sky by your great power! There’s </em><em>nothing’s</em><em> you can’t do. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> show enduring love to </em><em>thousands, but</em><em> pay </em>the consequences <em>of one generations’ </em><em>sins</em><em> on the next, great powerful God. Your name is </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> of Hosts. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>You’re<em> great in counsel and powerful </em><em>in deed</em><em>. You see everything people do and repay them accordingly. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>showed signs and wonders in Egypt, in our time in Israel, and elsewhere. You’ve made a name for yourself. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> brought your people out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand, outstretched arm, and great terror. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> gave them this </em><em>land</em><em> you swore to their ancestors you’d give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> took possession of it, but they didn’t obey your Law; </em><em>so</em><em> you brought this catastrophe on them. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Siege</em><em> mounds have come up to take it by sword, famine, and disease. You’ll give it to the Babylonians. What you said has happened. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Lord</em><em> G</em><em>OD</em><em>, you told me to buy the field and call witnesses, even though you’re giving the city to the Babylonians.’”</em><strong>	   </strong><strong>Jer 32:14-25</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> So this is what the LORD God of Israel says about this city he has given over to sword, famine, and disease: <strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>“I’ll</em><em> gather them out of the lands where I drive them in my anger, wrath, and great indignation, and bring them back here to live safely. </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> be my people and I’ll be their God. </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> give them one heart and one way so they’ll always respect me for the good of them and their descendants. </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> make an everlasting covenant not to abandon </em><em>them</em><em> and to put respect for me in their hearts so they won’t abandon </em><em><u>me</u></em><em>. </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>With</em><em> all my heart and soul, I’ll enjoy doing them good and faithfully planting them in this land. </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>Just</em><em> as I brought this catastrophe on them, I’ll bring on them all the </em><em>good</em><em> I’m promising. </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>People</em><em> will buy fields in this land that you say is ‘a waste without people or animals,’ </em>a land<em> lost to the Babylonians. </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> call witnesses and seal deeds in </em><em>Benjamin, in Jerusalem, in the towns in Judah, the hill country, the western foothills, and the Negev. I’ll restore their fortunes.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>Jer 32:36-44</strong></span>
