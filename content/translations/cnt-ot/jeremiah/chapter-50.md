## Jeremiah Chapter 50

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message the LORD Spoke About Babylon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A nation has come down against it from the north. It will make the land something to abhor; nobody will live there. People and animals will wander off. 4"At that time, Israel and Judah will return home. They'll go along weeping, looking for the LORD their God. 5They'll ask how to get to Zion and turn in that direction to join the LORD in an everlasting covenant they won't forget. 6"My people have become lost sheep. Their shepherds had led them astray and abandoned them on the mountains. They've gone along from mountain to hill and lost track of their resting place. 7Everyone that came at them has devoured them. Their enemies have said, 'We didn't do anything wrong; they'd sinned against the LORD, where goodness lives, who was their ancestors' hope.' 8"Wander away from Babylon and leave the land of the Babylonians. Be like male goats at the head of the flock. 9I'm going to bring against Babylon a horde of great nations from farther north. They'll draw up their battle lines and capture it. Their arrows will fly from skilled soldiers that won't come back empty-handed. 10Babylonia will become plunder. Those who plunder it will gather as much as they want," 				the LORD says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Because of the LORD's anger,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Draw up your battle lines on every side of Babylon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Raise your battle cry at it everywhere!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Eliminate the sower from Babylon 17"Israel is like a flock driven away and scattered by lions. The king of Assyria devoured it first. Then Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, broke its bones. 18So the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, 'I'm going to punish Babylon like I punished Assyria. 19I'll bring Israel back to his pasture so he can graze on Carmel and Bashan. He'll eat as much as he wants in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead. 20At that time, they'll search for Israel's iniquity and Judah's sin, but they won't find any. That's because I'll pardon the ones I'm leaving as a remnant.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The noise of battle is in the land</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> How the sledgehammer of the whole world</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I set a snare for you and caught you, Babylon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The LORD has opened his armory</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Attack it from the farthest border;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Kill its young bulls with the sword;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> There's the sound of fugitives from Babylon;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> So its young men will fall in its streets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> I'm against you, arrogant one;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The arrogant one will stumble and fall</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The LORD of Hosts says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Their redeemer is strong;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> A sword against them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> A sword against their fortunetellers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> A sword against their horses and chariots,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> A drought to dry up its water 39"So the desert animals will live there along with jackals and owls. Nobody will ever live in it again 40as when I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> They take hold of bow and javelin;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> The king of Babylon has heard the reports about them, 44"Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I'll chase everyone away from it in an instant. I'll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> So listen to what the LORD has planned for Babylon and the Babylonians. They'll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 46At the shout, "Babylon's been captured!" the ground will shake. The nations will hear the shout.</span>
