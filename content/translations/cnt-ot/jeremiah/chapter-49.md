## Jeremiah Chapter 49

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About Ammon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The time's coming</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Why do you brag about your fertile valleys?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'm going to bring terror on you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yet later I'll restore Ammon's fortunes."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> About Edom</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Turn around, run away,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If grape-gatherers come to you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But I'll strip bare Esau's land</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But leave its orphans behind; I'll keep them alive;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The LORD says, "If the ones that didn't deserve the cup have to drink it, will you be let off? You will drink it! 13I've sworn by myself that Bozrah will be something to abhor, a disgrace, a ruin, a curse. Its towns will lie in permanent ruins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I've heard a message from the LORD;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll make you small among the nations;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The terror you inspired 17"Edom will be something to abhor. Everybody that goes past it will be horrified and hiss at its wounds. 18Like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, and its neighbors, nobody will live there. 19Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I'll chase everybody away from it. I'll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me.  20So listen to the LORD's plan for Edom, his intentions for Teman. They'll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 21The ground will shake at their downfall. The outcry will be heard all the way to the Red Sea. 22It's enemy will soar high and swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings against Bozrah. The hearts of Edom's mighty men will be like the heart of a woman in labor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> About Damascus</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Damascus is helpless;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> How that famous city has been deserted,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Its young men will fall in its streets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> About Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They'll take away their tents and flocks,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Run! Flee! Live in deep caves,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Their camels will be plunder;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah About Elam</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> I'm going to bring on Elam the four winds</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> I'll scatter Elam ahead the enemies</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then I'll set my throne in Elam</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Yet later I'll restore Elam's fortunes.'"</span>
