## Jeremiah Chapter **34**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah <strong>When Nebuchadnezzar</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> King of Babylon</strong> <strong>and His Army and the Kingdoms He Ruled</strong><strong> Were</strong> <strong>Fighting Jerusalem and </strong><strong>Surrounding </strong><strong>Towns </strong> <strong>A Warning to Zedekiah</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Go tell Zedekiah, king of Judah, that the LORD says, <em>“I’m giving this city to the king of Babylon, and he’ll burn it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> be captured and </em><em>turned over</em><em> to him.</em><em> </em><em>You’ll see </em><em>him</em><em> </em><em>in person,</em><em> he’ll speak to you </em><em>directly, and you’ll go to Babylon.” </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But listen to the LORD, Zedekiah! <em>“</em><em>You won’t die by the sword; </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>you’ll</em><em> die in peace.</em><em> </em><em>As they burned spices for the kings before you, they’ll burn spices </em><em>and lament, ‘Ah, lord!</em><em>’</em><em> for you. </em><em>I’ve spoken</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>That’s what Jeremiah told Zedekiah <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>while Babylon’s army was fighting Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah, the only fortified cities left in Judah.<strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah <strong>After King Zedekiah Made a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Agreement</strong> <strong>with the People in Jerusalem to Declare Liberty</strong> <strong>Freedom for Hebrew Slaves</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Each man was to free his Hebrew male and female slaves so nobody would enslave a fellow Jewish. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The officials and the people obeyed and agreed not to hold them as slaves any longer. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But afterward they went back on their word and brought their freed slave back into subjection.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then a message from the LORD came to Jeremiah:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The LORD God of Israel says,<em> “</em><em>I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of bondage </em><em>in</em><em> Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>At</em><em> the end of seven years, set your </em><em>fellow </em><em>Hebrew </em><em>free </em><em>that’s been sold to you.</em><em> </em><em>But your ancestors didn’t obey me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Recently</em><em> you </em><em>changed</em><em> and did</em><em> what wa</em><em>s right</em><em>. Y</em><em>ou </em><em>freed</em><em> your </em><em>fellow citizen</em><em> and made a covenan</em><em>t in my presence</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> you’ve </em><em>gone back on your word </em><em>and profaned my name.</em><em> </em><em>You’ve </em><em>enslaved</em><em> </em><em>again the</em><em> s</em><em>laves </em><em>you’</em><em>d freed.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 34:12-16</p>

### 17“You haven’t obeyed me by releasing your brother and fellow citizen; so I’m releasing you to sword, famine, and disease. I’ll make you something other kingdoms abhor. 18-20The ones that didn’t keep that covenant, I’ll release to their enemies that want to kill them: officials in Judah and Jerusalem, court officers, priests, and common people who cut a calf in two and passed between its parts. Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. 21I’ll deliver Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies, 22and direct them to attack this city again, burn it, and fill Judah with ghost towns.”           	      Jer 34:17-22
