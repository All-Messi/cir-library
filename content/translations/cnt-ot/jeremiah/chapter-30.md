<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Ask and see if a man can have a baby.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> That day will be like no other,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll break the yoke off his neck and tear off its straps. Foreigners won't enslave him anymore. 9He'll serve the LORD his God and David his king that I'll raise up for him."</span>
