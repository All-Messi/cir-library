## Jeremiah Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the LORD told me, "Even if Moses and Samuel were standing here, my heart wouldn't be with this nation. Send them away! 2If they ask you where to go, tell them the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll send four kinds of destruction on you: the sword to slay, dogs to drag away, buzzards to devour, and scavengers to consume. 4I'll see that the kingdoms abhor you because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You've left me and keep getting worse;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll winnow you with a winnowing fork</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You'll have more widows than sand by the sea;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> She that bore seven sons will pine away</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD said, "I'll set you free for good;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Can anybody smash iron,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Because of your sins within your borders, I'll give away your wealth and treasures as plunder free of charge. 14Your enemies will take it to a country you don't know about, because my anger has been fired up. It'll burn you up."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When I discovered your words, I devoured them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I didn't sit with the revelers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Why does my pain persist?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So the LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then for my people I'll make you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I'll keep you away from sinners</span>
