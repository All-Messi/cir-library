## Jeremiah Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Look up at the barren hills;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So I've withheld showers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Haven't you called out to me just now,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> At the time of King Josiah, the LORD said to me: "Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She's gone up on every tall hill and carried on her prostitution under every green tree. 7I thought that after she'd done that, she'd come back to me. But she didn't, and her unfaithful sister saw it. 8I gave Israel divorce papers and sent her away for her adultery, but her unfaithful sister Judah wasn't afraid. She left and became a prostitute too. 9Because prostitution was a small matter to her, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. 10Despite all this, her unfaithful sister Judah didn't come back to me with all her heart, only in pretense."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The LORD told me: "Unfaithful Israel has proved to be more upright than unfaithful Judah. 12Go deliver this message toward the north,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Just own up to your unfaithfulness to me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Come back, unfaithful children,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll give you shepherds after my own heart who will feed you knowledge and insight. 16When you've multiplied in the land, they won't say anymore 'The Ark of the LORD's covenant.' It won't be remembered or missed or remade. 17At that time, they'll call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD. All the nations will gather there to be in his presence. They'll stop following their stubborn, sinful hearts. 18Judah will follow Israel; together they'll come back from exile in the north to the land I gave their ancestors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But like an unfaithful wife that leaves her husband,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> On the barren hills is the sound of</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The hills are a delusion, 24"But from the time we were young, shameful things have consumed our ancestors' labors, flocks and herds, sons and daughters. 25Let's lie down in our shame and cover ourselves with our humiliation. We and our ancestors have sinned against the LORD our God. We haven't obeyed him."</span>
