<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Israel was holy to me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A Message from the LORD to the House of Jacob</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The LORD says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They didn't say, 'Where's the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I brought you to a productive land</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The priests didn't say, 'Where's the LORD?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Sail to Cyprus and see;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Has any nation ever changed gods</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> What are you doing on the road to Egypt</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Your own sins will correct you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yet I planted you as a choice stock,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Though you wash yourself with lye and lots of soap,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Where are the gods you made for yourselves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Can a young woman forget her jewelry,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> You scheme so well to find love!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> The blood of the innocent poor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> How lightly you gad around from one way to another;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> You'll leave here with your hands on your head,</span>
