## Jeremiah Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from the LORD at the Beginning</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The LORD says, "Stand in the court of Yahveh's Temple and speak to the towns in Judah that have come to worship here. Don't hold back a word! 3Maybe they'll listen so I can change my mind about the catastrophe I'm planning for them. 4Tell them, 'If you won't follow the Law I've given you 5or listen to the prophets I've sent you time and again, 6then I'll make this Temple like Shiloh and this city accursed to every nation.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The priests, the prophets, and the people were listening to Jeremiah saying this. 8When he finished, they grabbed him, "You have to die! 9Why did you prophesy in Yahveh's name that this Temple will be like Shiloh and this city without residents?" The people gathered around him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When the officials of Judah heard about that, they came up from the king's palace to Yahveh's Temple and sat in the entrance of the New Gate. 11The priests and prophets told the officials and the people, "This man has to die! You've heard him prophesy against this city."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Jeremiah answered, "Yahveh sent me to prophesy the message you heard. 13If you mend your ways and deeds and obey him, he'll change his mind about this misfortune. 14Do to me what you like. 15Just know that if you put me to death, you'll bring innocent blood on yourselves, this city, and its people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The officials and the people told the priests and prophets, "This man doesn't deserve to die. He's spoken to us in the name of Yahveh our God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Some elders of the land stood up and told the assembly, 18"Micah of Moresheth prophesied at the time of Hezekiah, king of Judah. He told the people in Judah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Did Hezekiah and Judah put him to death? Didn't they respect Yahveh and ask for his blessing? Yahveh changed his mind about the misfortune he'd pronounced on them. We're about to do ourselves great harm."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Another man prophesied in Yahveh's name, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. Like Jeremiah, he was prophesying against this city and the land. 21When King Jehoiakim, his officials, and soldiers heard it, the king tried to put him to death, but Uriah found out and fled to Egypt. 22The king sent Elnathan son of Achbor and some others to Egypt, 23and they brought him back. Jehoiakim killed him with a sword and threw his body into the graves for commoners. 24But Ahikam son of Shaphan defended Jeremiah; so he wasn't executed.</span>
