## About Christian Internet Resources (CIR)

Christian Internet Resources (CIR) presents its essays with the characteristics of personal relationship in mind: **interpersonalism (IP)**. That feature of the Christian worldview joins our personal creator to us and to each other, and provides for a systematic theology in website form. IP establishes the context for every topic and impacts the interpretation of scripture since the convictions about interpersonalism arise in the first place from revelation's self-consistent witness.

### Our Purpose

Here we try our hand at providing clear answers to age-old issues that should be understandable to wayfaring strangers and useful to seasoned theologians. After all, the Lord's way claims to be simple enough that everyday people need not err in it (Isaiah 35:8) though interpersonalism is the most complex reality that exists. It is not beyond the simple or beneath the wise because experience has already taught the simple how it operates, and its complexity sufficiently challenges the wise to search its depths.

### About the Author

Virgil Warren, PhD, is a theologian and biblical scholar. One author stands behind virtually everything the website presents. That fact correlates with our striving to achieve consistency and emphasizing ideas more than concentrating on who says what about which.

### Our Approach

The approach calls for all personal operations to operate in the mode of First and Second Great Commandments. Love as defined by the Golden Rule serves as the positive code word for all vertical and horizontal actions between persons.

Our studies endeavor to avoid anything pejorative about viewpoints alternative to ours. We have supposed that people believe what they believe because they think it is true. Assuming improper attitudes and bad motives frustrates the meeting of minds. The Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12) applies to opponents as well as friends (5:43-44).

## Understanding Our Structure

### Level System

CIR content is organized into three levels based on length, complexity, and whether biblical languages are significantly involved:

- **Level 1**: Short treatments including dictionaries, prime passages, misused scriptures, and short answers to frequent questions
- **Level 2**: Medium-length essays with moderate theological complexity
- **Level 3**: Substantial documents; may involve detailed biblical language study

### Document Indicators

- **\*** indicates substantial documents
- **G** indicates Greek is significantly involved
- **H** indicates Hebrew is significantly involved
- **LXX** - Septuagint, a widely-used, pre-Christian Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament
- **MT** - Masoretic Text, the standardized Old Testament Hebrew text

### Position Papers

A high proportion of our presentations function as position papers on topics of interest. They do not aim to qualify as scholarly studies by providing extensive documentation of sources for ideas not available in print to much of a typical readership anyway. Being position papers explains why a great number of our offerings are relatively short.
