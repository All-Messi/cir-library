Bill,

Enclosed is a copy of my review of James Torrance’s book.  Apologies again for the long delay.  Along with the review, please find a copy of an essay on evangelism as integrated with interpersonalism.  Let me know either way whether you think you can or cannot use the unsolicited material.  It will likely go up on the Internet with the other essays if there is no other avenue of publication for it.  Both the book review and the essay are on a floppy disk that I have sent along with the hard copy.  The disk is in MicroSoft Word 97; if you can use it from the disk, it may save you some editing time.

In our common calling,
