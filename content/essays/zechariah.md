ZECHARIAH

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1The Eighth Month, Second Year of Darius

A Message from Yahveh to the Prophet Zechariah Ben-Berechiah Ben-Iddo

A Call to Return to Yahveh

2“IYwas angry with your ancestors. 3So tell the people, ‘Yahveh of hosts says, “Come back to me so I can come back to you. 4Don’t be like your ancestors that former prophets told to come back from their sinful ways and deeds, but they didn’t pay any attention. 5Where are those ancestors? Prophets don’t live forever, 6but my message commanded through them did come to bear on your ancestors. As a result, they repented and said, ‘Yahveh of hosts has dealt with us the way he intended, according to our ways and deeds.’”’” 	Zech 1:1-6

7The Twenty-Fourth Day, Eleventh Month (Shebat), Second Year of Darius

A Message from Yahveh to Zechariah

A Man Among the Murtle Trees

8During the night I saw a man on a chestnut horse among some myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were chestnut, sorrel, and white horses and their riders. 9I said, “Sir, what do those horses mean?”

The angel said, “I’ll show you.”

10The man on the horse among the myrtle trees said, “Yahveh has sent them to patrol the earth.”

11They answered the angel of Yahveh, who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We’ve patrolled the earth. It’s peaceful and quiet.”

12The angel asked, “Yahveh of Hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and the towns in Judah that you’ve been angry with these 70 years?”

13Yahveh answered him with gracious, reassuring words.

14So the angel told me,

“Declare that Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘I’m jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, 15but I’m angry with the nations that are at ease. While I was a little angry, they made the disaster worse. 16So I’ll come back to Jerusalem with mercy. My Temple will be rebuilt there, and a measuring line will be stretched out over it for reconstructing it.’”

17“Also say, ‘My towns will overflow with prosperity again. I’ll comfort Zion again and choose Jerusalem once more.’”	Zech 1:7-17

Four Horns and Four Blacksmiths

18Then I looked up and saw four horns. 19I asked the angel what they represented.

“The horns of the nations that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”

20Then Yahveh showed me four blacksmiths.

21I asked what they were coming to do.

“The four horns scattered Judah and humbled it. But these blacksmiths have come to hammer down and destroy the nations that lifted up their horns to scatter the people of Judah.”	Zech 1:18-21

A Man with a Measuring Line

2:1Then I saw a man holding a measuring line, and 2asked him where he was going.

“To measure how wide and long Jerusalem is.”

3The angel that was talking to me was leaving, and another angel met him 4and said,

“Run and tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be lived in like open country because of the number of people and livestock that’s in it. 5I’ll be a fire wall around it and the glory in it.

6“Flee from up north where I’ve scattered you to the four winds.  7Zion! Escape, you exiles in Babylon.’

8“‘It’s for glory that he has sent me against the nations that plundered you, because whoever touches you will be poking themselves in the eye. 9I’ll raise my fist over them so their slaves will plunder them. You’ll know Yahveh of Hosts has sent me.

10“Sing and be happy, Zion, because I’m coming to live among you. 11Many nations will join Yahveh then and become my people. I’ll live among you, and you’ll know Yahveh of Hosts has sent me to you. 12He’ll own Judah as his portion in the holy land and choose Jerusalem again.’”

13Be silent in his presence, all you nations; he has risen up to take action from the holy place where he lives.	Zech 2:1-13

The Cleansing of Joshua the High Priest

3:1Then he showed me Joshua/Jeshua the high priest standing in front of the angel of Yahveh, and Satan standing to his right to accuse him. 2Yahveh told Satan, “Yahveh rebuke you, Satan! I who chose Jerusalem reject your accusations! Isn’t this man a brand snatched out of the fire?”

3Joshua’s clothes were dirty, 4so the angel told the ones standing there, “Change his dirty clothes.” “I’ve taken your sinfulness off so I can dress you up with festive robes.”

5I said, “Have them put a clean turban on him too.” So they dressed him up while the angel of Yahveh stood by.	Zech 3:1-5

6The angel charged Joshua,

7“Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘If you follow me and do your service, you’ll have charge of my Temple and courts. I’ll let you have free access along with the ones that are standing here. 8Listen, Joshua, you and your friends sitting in front of you are symbols, because I’m going to bring in my servant the Branch. 9Look at the stone I’ve put in front of Joshua, a single stone with seven facets. I’ll engrave an inscription on it and remove the sinfulness of the land in one day. 10At that time, each one of you will invite your friend to sit under your vine and fig tree.’”

Zech 3:6-10

A Lampstand and Two Olive Trees

4:1The angel came back and brought me to as if I’d been asleep. 2He asked me what I saw.

“A gold lampstand with its bowl of oil on top, as well as its seven lamps with one spout apiece. 3I see an olive tree on each side of it. 4What do they mean, Sir?”

5“Don’t you know?”

“No.”

6“This is what Yahveh tells Zerubbabel, ‘Not by force, not by power, but by my Spirit. 7Not even a big mountain will be able to get in your way. You’ll set the cap stone for the Temple amid shouts of “God bless it!! God bless it!”’”	 Zech 4:1-7

8A Message from Yahveh to Me

9“Zerubbabel has laid the foundation for the Temple, and he’ll finish it. Then you’ll know Yahveh of Hosts is the One that sent me to youpl. 10Whoever has been disappointed during the time of small beginnings will be happy when they see Zerubbabel holding a plumb line. These seven lamps represent Yahveh’s eyes that scan back and forth over the world.”

11I asked, “What do the two olive trees beside the lampstand represent? 12What do the two olive branches represent beside the two gold tubes that drain out the golden oil?”

13“You don’t know?”

“No, Sir.”

14“They represent the two anointed ones that stand beside the Lord of the whole world.”

Zech 4:8-14

A Flying Scroll

5:1Then I looked up and saw a flying scroll.

2He said, “What do you see?”

“A flying scroll, 15 by 30ft.”

3He told me,

“It contains the words of the curse that’s over the whole world. Everyone that steals will be erased from one side. Everyone that swears falsely will be erased from the other. 4Yahveh of Hosts will send the curse out to the thief’s house and to the house of the one that swears falsely by his name. The curse will remain there all night till it consumes its timbers and stones.’”  	Zech 5:1-4

A Woman in a Basket

5The angel came forward and said, “Look at what’s coming.”

6I said, “What is it?”

“A basket ephah for measuring grain. It’s filled with the sins of everybody in the land 7[a lead cover was lifted off of it], and that’s a woman sitting inside it 8named Wickedness!” He shoved her down into the ephah and put the lead lid back on it. 9I saw two women flying toward us with wings like a stork. They took the ephah up in the air.

10I asked the angel where they were taking it.

11“To Shinar to build a temple for it. When it’s ready, they’ll set the ephah there on its own pedestal.”	 Zech 5:5-11

Four Chariots

6:1I looked again and saw four chariots coming out from between two bronze mountains. 2Chestnut horses were pulling the first chariot, black horses the second, 3white horses the third, and powerful dappled-gray horses the fourth.

4I asked the angel, “What are they, Sir?”

5“They’re the four spirits of heaven going out from the Lord of the whole world. 6One chariot is going north with the black horses; after them the white horses are going west. The dappled-gray horses are going south. 7Those powerful horses went out, chomping at the bit to patrol the world.”

He said, “Go on and patrol it.” So they did.

8Then he shouted to me, “Look, the ones going north have appeased my anger there.”

Zech 6:1-8

9A Message from Yahveh to Me

The Crowning of Joshua

10“Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring an offering of silver and gold from the exiles in Babylon. The same day, go to the house of Josiah Ben-Zephaniah to meet them. 11Make a crown out of the silver and gold, and put it on Joshua/Jeshua Ben-Jehozadak, the high priest. 12Tell him, ‘Yahveh of Hosts says a man named Branch will “branch out” from where he is and build the Temple, 13bear the honor, and rule from his throne. He’ll also be a priest on his throne, and his combined roles will work together.’ 14The crown will serve as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah in Yahveh’s Temple. 15People from a long way off will come to rebuild the Temple.”

When these things come about, they’ll assure you that Yahveh of Hosts has sent me. They will all happen if you faithfully obey him. 	Zech 6:9-15

7:1The Fourth Day, Ninth Month (Chislev), Fourth Year of King Darius

A Message from Yahveh to Zechariah

A Call for Justice and Mercy, Not Fasting

2The people in Bethel had sent Sharezer, Regem-melech, and their men to ask for Yahveh’s blessing. 3They spoke to the priests in Yahveh’s Temple and to the prophets,

“Should we keep mourning and fasting in the fifth month like we’ve done all these years?”

4A Message from Yahveh to Me

5“Tell the priests and people in the land, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months those 70 years, were you really fasting for me? 6And now when you eat and drink, aren’t you eating and drinking for yourselves? 7Isn’t that the same message Yahveh delivered by the former prophets to the people in Jerusalem when it and its towns were prospering, and people were living in the Negev and western foothills?’”	Zech 7:1-7

8A Message from Yahveh to Zechariah

9“Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘Judge fairly, practice kindness and mercy with each other. 10Don’t oppress widows and orphans, foreigners or poor people. Don’t plot against one another.’ 11But your ancestors refused to pay attention, turned a stubborn shoulder, and covered their ears. 12They hardened their hearts like flint so they couldn’t hear the Law and what Yahveh had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. That’s why he was so angry with them. 13Just as he called and they wouldn’t listen, so they called and he wouldn’t listen. 14With a tornado he scattered them throughout foreign nations. The land they left lay so desolate nobody traveled through it. They’d turned their pleasant land into a wasteland.”	Zech 7:8-14

8:1A Message from Yahveh

Promised Blessings for Jerusalem

2“Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘I’m jealous for Zion. 3I’ll come back to live in Jerusalem, and it’ll be called The City of Truth. My mountain will be called The Holy Mount. 4Old men and women will sit in its streets again with staffs in hand because they’re old. 5Boys and girls will play in the streets. 6If that sounds incredible to the remnant that’s left, does that make it incredible for me?  7I’m going to save my people from lands east and west 8and bring them back to live here. They’ll be my people, and I’ll be their God, faithful and just.’  	Zech 8:1-8

9“Be strong, you that are listening to this message from the prophets who spoke when the foundation of myY Temple was being laid so it could be completely rebuilt. 10Before then there weren’t any jobs. Because criminals were everywhere, travelers weren’t safe; everybody was working against everybody else. 11But I won’t treat the remnant like that now. 12Their descendants will have peace, the grapevines will bear fruit, the ground will grow produce, the sky will drop dew. The remnant will inherit those things. 13Just as you were a curse among the nations, Judah and Israel, so I’ll save you to become a blessing. Don’t be afraid; be strong.

14“Just as I planned to punish you when your ancestors were so offensive to me and I didn’t hold back; 15so now I intend to treat Jerusalem and Judah well. Don’t be afraid! 16To have peace around you, tell the truth and judge honestly. 17Don’t make plots or commit perjury. I despise things like that.”     	Zech 8:9-17

18A Message from Yahveh to Me

19“Yahveh of hosts says, ‘The fasts in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will be a joy for Judah; so love honesty and peace. 20People from cities all around will attend. 21One city will go to another and say, “Let’s travel together to look up to Yahveh and ask for his blessing.”

“All right.”

22So, many nations and powerful countries will look up to meY in Jerusalem and ask for my blessing.’ 23Ten men from different languages will clutch one Jew’s cloak and say, “Can we go along? We’ve heard that God is with you.”’”	Zech 8:18-23

9:1A Message from Yahveh Against the Land of Hadrach [Aram]

The message from Yahveh is against Damascus—for the eyes of all people, including the tribes of Israel, are on Yahveh—

2against Hamath, which borders it,

and against Tyre and Sidon, though they’re so very wise.

3Tyre built a fortress,

piled up silver like dust,

and gold like dirt on the streets.

4Yahveh will confiscate its possessions,

throw its wealth into the sea;

and burn it down.

5Ashkelon will see it and be afraid.

Gaza will writhe in anguish;

Ekron, too, because it’s lost hope;

Gaza won’t have a king;

Ashkelon will be empty.

6Ashdod will house a mongrel race;

I’ll destroy the Philistines’ pride.

7I’ll remove the blood from their mouths

and the disgusting things from between their teeth.

They’ll be a remnant for our God,

like a clan in Judah;

Ekron will be like Jebusites.	Zech 9:1-7

8I’ll camp around my Temple to protect it

so armies can’t walk all over my people;

oppressors won’t run over them anymore

because I’m watching.

Zion’s Coming King

9Celebrate, Zion!

Shout, Jerusalem!

Your king is coming to you,

just and able to save,

humble and riding on a donkey,

on a colt, a donkey’s foal.

10I’ll get rid of chariots in Ephraim,

warhorses in Jerusalem,

and the bow used in battle.

I’ll offer peace to the nations

and rule from sea to sea,

from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.	Zech 9:8-10

11Because of my covenant with you, sealed with blood,

I’ve freed your prisoners from the dry cistern.

12Come back to the fortress, all you prisoners that still have hope;

I promise to restore you double today.

13I’ll bend Judah like my bow;

Ephraim will be my arrow.

I’ll stir up Zion against Greece

and wield you like a sword.

14Yahveh will appear above them;

his arrows will shoot like lightning.

He’ll blow the bugle

and march in the windstorm from the south.	Zech 9:11-14

15Yahveh of Hosts will defend his people;

they’ll trample the stone slingers.

They’ll drink their bloodlxx and be boisterous as with wine,

filled like a sacrificial basin,

drenched like the horns on the altar.

16Yahveh their God will save them then

like a flock of his sheep,

like jewels in a crown,

sparkling in his land.

17How nice things will be!

Grain will make the young men thrive;

new wine will make the maidens flourish.	Zech 9:15-17

Yahveh Will Restore His People

10:1Ask Yahveh for showers in the spring;

the One that forms the storm clouds

will give each farmer crops in his field.

2Household gods speak nonsense;

fortunetellers see false dreams

and give empty consolation.

So people wander in danger like lost sheep

because they don’t have a shepherd.

3“My anger flares at the shepherds;

I’ll punish the male goats,

because I care about my flock, the House of Judah;

I’ll make them like my majestic steed in battle.

4The cornerstone will come from Judah,

the tent peg, the bow in battle, and every ruler.

5Together they’ll become great warriors

and walk all over their enemies like dirt on a road;

they’ll fight because Yahveh will be on their side;

they’ll outfight enemies that ride horses.

6He’ll strengthen Judah and save Joseph,

and bring them back.

7Ephraim will become a powerful man

and be happy as if from wine.

His children will see it and be happy too,

and celebrate in Yahveh.	Zech 10:1-7

8I’ll whistle for them to gather

because I’ve redeemed them;

there’ll be as many of them as before.

9Though I scattered them among the nations,

they’ll remember me in far countries,

survive with their children,

and return.

10I’ll bring them back from Egypt and Assyria

and settle them in Gilead and Lebanon

till they take up the whole area.

11I’ll escort them through the distressing Red Sea

and hold back its waves;

I’ll completely dry up the Nile,

crush Assyria’s pride,

and end Egypt’s rule.

12I’ll make my people strong,

and they’ll follow me.” 	Zech 10:8-12

Good and Bad Shepherds

11:1Open your doors, Lebanon,

so fire can consume your cedar forests.

2Wail, cypress trees, for the fallen cedars;

The stately trees have burned up.

Wail, oaks of Bashan;

the thick woodland has been cut down.

3The shepherds wail

because their good pasture’s gone.

The young lions roar

because the jungle by the Jordan is decimated. 	Zech 11:1-3

4Yahveh my God says,

“Pasture the flock that’s doomed to slaughter. 5The buyers butcher them without remorse. The sellers say, ‘Praise Yahveh, I’m rich!’ Their own shepherds don’t care about them! 6I won’t have mercy on people like that. I’ll let them fall into each other’s hands and the hands of their king. They’ll ruin the land, and I won’t protect it.”	 Zech 11:4-6

7So I began pasturing the flock that was doomed to slaughter by the ones that trafficked in sheep. I took two staffs; I called one Favor and the other Unity, and I tended the flock with them. 8I fired three worthless shepherds in one month.

I also lost patience with the sheep, and they lost interest in me. 9I told them,

“I won’t pasture you anymore.

What’s to die will die;

what’s to be destroyed will be destroyed.

The rest will eat one another.”

10The staff I called Favor I cut in pieces to demonstrate that I was breaking the covenant I’d made with all the nations. 11That day, the ones that trafficked in sheep realized Yahveh was acting out a message through me. 12I told them, “If you want, pay me; if not, keep it!” So they weighed out 12 oz 30 shekels of silver to pay me. 13Yahveh told me, “Throw them to the potter, that grand value they put on me!” So I threw them to the potter in Yahveh’s Temple. 14Then I cut in pieces the staff I called Unity to demonstrate that I was breaking the alliance between Judah and Israel.     				Zech 11:7-14

15Yahveh told me,

“Again, dress up like a worthless shepherd. 16I’m going to show the land a picture of a shepherd that won’t take care of the dying, look for the strays, heal the injured, or feed the healthy. He’ll eat the healthy ones and tear off their hoofs.

17“Misfortune awaits the worthless shepherd

that deserts the flock!

A sword will cut his arm

and poke out his right eye!

His arm will wither,

and his right eye will go blind.”	Zech 11:15-17

12:1A Message from Yahveh About Israel

Future Destruction of Jerusalem’s Enemies

This is what Yahveh says who stretched out the sky, laid earth’s foundation, and formed the human spirit:

2“I’m going to make Jerusalem a cup that makes every nation stagger who lays siege to Jerusalem and Judah. 3I’ll make Jerusalem a heavy rock; any nation that tries to pick it up will rupture itself. When nations surround it, 4I’ll make their horses bolt and their riders panic, but I’ll watch over Judah as I strike those enemies’ horses blind. 5The clans in Judah will realize that the residents of Jerusalem have strong protection from Yahveh of Hosts their God.’ 	Zech 12:1-5

6“At that time, I’ll make the clans in Judah like a fire pot in a woodpile, a torch among bundles of grain. They’ll consume the nations around them while Jerusalem stays safe. 7Yahveh will save the people in Judah first so David’s royal line and Jerusalem won’t have greater glory than the rest of Judah. 8The weakest among the people in Jerusalem will be as strong as David, and his descendants will lead them out like God, like the angel of Yahveh. 9I’ll destroy any nation that attacks Jerusalem.	Zech 12:6-9

The One They Have Pierced

10“I’ll pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on David’s family and the people in Jerusalem so they’ll look at me that they’ve speared. They’ll mourn for me like people mourn for an only son or a firstborn son. 11There’ll be extreme mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning for Hadad-rimmon on the Plain of Megiddo. 12Each clan in Israel will mourn by itself, husbands and wives separately: the clans of Nathan, 13Levi, the Shimeites, and 14the rest.  	Zech 12:10-14

The Cleansing Fountain

13:1“Then a fountain will spring up for David’s house and the people in Jerusalem, a fountain for cleansing sin and impurity. 2I’ll get rid of the idols in Israel; they’ll fade from memory. I’ll remove false prophets and unclean spirits. 3If anybody still tries to make up their own prophecy, their own parents will say, ‘You’ve lied in Yahveh’s name!’ and they’ll run them through. 4People will be averse to claiming they’ve had visions; they won’t put on a prophet’s hairy robe to create impressions. 5They’ll say, ‘I’m not a prophet; I plow ground because a man sold me as a slave when I was a kid.’ 6If somebody asks him, ‘Where did those scars come from around your wrists?’ he’ll say, ‘From wounds at “a friend’s” house!’    	Zech 13:1-6

The Shepherd Struck, the Sheep Scattered

7Wake up, sword, against my shepherd,

my associate;

strike the shepherd,

scatter the sheep,

and turn against the lambs.

8In the whole land, two parts will perish,

but the third will survive;

9I’ll bring that third part through the fire,

refine them like silver,

purify them like gold.

They’ll call on me, and I’ll answer.

I’ll say, ‘They’re my people’;

they’ll say, ‘Yahveh’s our God.’” 		Zech 13:7-9

Yahveh Will Rule the World

14:1Yahveh will bring a time when nations will plunder you right in front of you. 2He’ll gather them against Jerusalem and capture it. The houses will be looted and the women raped; half the people will be exiled and the rest abandoned among the ruins.

3But then Yahveh will go out and fight them. 4His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem. The mountain will split apart east to west, half moving north and half moving south with a wide valley between. 5You’ll escape by that valley, which will reach as far as Azal. You’ll flee like you did from the earthquake when Uzziah reigned in Judah. Then Yahveh my God will come with his holy ones! 6There won’t be any cold or frost, 7a unique day known only to Yahveh, without day or night; there’ll be light in the evening. 8At that time, water will pour out of Jerusalem year around, half to the Dead Sea and half to the Mediterranean.

9Yahveh will become king of the whole world, the only one. 10The land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will become a large plain. But Jerusalem will rise on its site from Benjamin’s Gate to the First Gate to the Corner Gate, from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses. 11People will live in Jerusalem safely because its curse will be gone. 	Zech 14:1-11

12Yahveh will use a plague to strike the nations that attacked Jerusalem. Their flesh will rot while they’re standing; their eyes will decay in their sockets; their tongues will mold in their mouths. 13Yahveh will throw them into a panic, and they’ll attack one another in hand-to-hand combat. 14Judah will fight at Jerusalem and gather wealth from surrounding nations—lots of gold, silver, and clothing. 15There’ll also be a plague on the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and cattle in those enemies’ camps.

16Any nation that attacked Jerusalem and survived the plague, will go up every year to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, and celebrate the Festival of Booths. 17-18It won’t rain for any family in Egypt or elsewhere who won’t go up to that celebration. [19] 20Even the bells on their horses will bear the inscription “Holy to the LORD.” Cooking pots in his Temple will be as sacred as bowls beside the altar. 21Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be sacred to him, so everybody that sacrifices can boil meat in them from the sacrifices. There won’t be any Canaanites anymore in the Temple of the LORD of Hosts.	 Zech 14:12-21
