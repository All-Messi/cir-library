HABAKKUK

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1The Oracle That Habakkuk the Prophet Saw

Habakkuk’s Complaint

2How long, Yahveh, will I call out for help,

and you won’t listen?

I cry out, “Violence!”

but you don’t protect me.

3Why do you make me watch wickedness?

Destruction and violence go on right in front of me;

fighting and arguing keep getting worse and worse.

4The courts ignore the Law,

so they don’t render justice;

sinners are in the majority,

so they pervert justice. 	Hab 1:1-4

Yahveh’s Answer

5Yahveh’s first answer:

“Look around at the nations

and be astounded.

I’m doing something in your own day

you wouldn’t believe if somebody told you.

6I’m arousing the Babylonians,

that fierce, impetuous people

that marches across the region

to seize places to live that aren’t theirs.

7They’re dreaded and feared;

they’re a law unto themselves

and make their own rules.

8Their horses are faster than cheetahs,

more vicious than wolves at dusk.

Their cavalry comes charging from far away

and swoops down like eagles to devour their prey.

9They come bent on violence;

their hordes surge forward like a desert wind

and sweep captives away like sand.

10They scoff at kings and ridicule rulers;

they laugh at fortresses

and pile up ramparts to besiege them.

11They rush through like the wind and move on;

they’re guilty men whose power is their god.” 	Hab 1:5-11

Habakkuk’s Second Complaint

12Aren’t you from everlasting,

Yahveh, my God, my Holy One?

Surely you won’t let us die.

You, Yahveh, have appointed the Babylonians to judge us;

you, Rock, have sent them to punish us.

13You’re too pure to approve of evil;

you can’t countenance wickedness.

Why do you tolerate treacherous people?

Why are you silent when sinners swallow up

people better than themselves?	Hab 1:12-13

14They treat us like fish in the sea,

like creatures with no rulers.

15Sinful people fish us out with hooks

and scoop us up with nets.

They catch us in their seines;

they’re happy and celebrate.

16So they sacrifice to their seines

and burn incense to their fishing nets,

because they make large catches with them

and have lots to eat.

17Will they empty their nets then

and keep on killing nations without mercy?	Hab 1:14-17

2:1I’ll stand at my post and watch;

I’ll station myself on a watchtower

to see how he’ll answer my complaint.

Yahveh’s Second Answer

2Yahveh’s second answer:

“Write down this vision, etch it on tablets

so the messenger can run with it.

3The vision is still for a future time;

it speeds toward the goal and won’t fail.

Though it seems slow, wait for it;

it will certainly come in due time.	Hab 2:1-3

4“Arrogant people aren’t righteous,

but the righteous will have life by his trust in me.

5Besides, wine betrays the arrogant, so they don’t last.

Their greed increases like the grave;

like death, they’re never satisfied.

They gather the whole world to themselves

and use everybody. 				Hab 2:4-5

6“Won’t people taunt them and say in mockery,

‘Misfortune awaits you that accumulate what’s not yours

and make yourselves rich by extortion

—for how long, though?

7Won’t your creditors suddenly decide

to call in their loans?

You’ll become their plunder.

8Since you’ve looted many nations,

other nations will loot you

for the blood of men and women that you shed,

for your violence to towns and their people.’

Hab 2:6-8

9“Misfortune awaits whoever uses dishonest gain

to build a prominent house up high,

like a nest beyond harm’s reach.

10You’ve plotted shamelessly to build that house

by ruining lots of people’s lives;

you end up sinning against yourself.

11The very stones cry out against you from the wall,

and the beams in the ceiling echo the complaint.	Hab 2:9-11

12“Misfortune awaits whoever builds a city with murder

and establishes a town by violence!

13Isn’t it from Yahveh of hosts

that people labor only to have it burn up

and nations wear themselves out for nothing?

14The knowledge of Yahveh’s glory

will cover the earth like water fills the ocean. Hab 2:12-14

15“Misfortune awaits you that make other people drink

your venom to get them drunk

so you can stare at their disgrace!

16You’ll be disgraced, not honored;

you’ll drink and expose your own disgrace.

The cup in Yahveh’s right hand will come around to you;

complete disgrace will cover up your honor.

17The violence you did to Lebanon will overwhelm you;

the devastation of its animals will terrify you,

because of the murder and violence

you did to the land, its towns, and their people.

Hab 2:15-17

18“What good is an idol after its maker carves it,

or an image, which represents a lie?

Its maker puts his faith in what he’s made

when the idol he’s made can’t talk.

19Misfortune awaits whoever says to a piece of wood, ‘Wake up!’

or to a speechless stone, ‘Get up and help us!’

That’s your teacher!?

It’s overlaid with gold and silver,

but it can’t breathe.

20But Yahveh is in his holy Temple;

let the whole earth be silent in his presence.” 	Hab 2:18-20

3:1A Prayer of Habakkuk

Set to Shigionoth

2Yahveh, I’ve heard about you and stand in awe.

Revive your work in our time

and show what you can do;

in your anger remember mercy.	Hab 3:1-2

3God is coming from Teman,

the Holy One from Mount Paran.

His brilliance covers the sky;

his praise fills the earth.

4His brightness shines like sunshine;

lightning bolts flash from his hand

where his power lies hidden.

5Disease goes ahead of him;

plague follows him.

6He stops and looks the world over;

the nations see him and tremble.

He beats down the everlasting mountains

and levels the ancient hills.

His ways of working have existed from eternity.

7I can see the tents in Nubia in distress;

the tent curtains in Midian are shaking in fear.	Hab 3:3-7

8Did you rage against the rivers?

Was your anger against the streams?

Was it against the sea

that you drove your steeds and victory chariots?

9No. You took the cover off your bow

and put your arrows to the string.

You washed out canyons in the ground.

10The mountains watched you and shook

as the torrent flooded past;

The roaring deep cried out in surrender

and lifted its hands in submission.

11The sun and moon stood still;

they retreated at the flash of your arrows

and the radiance of your spear. 			Hab 3:8-11

12In your fury you marched across the world;

in your anger you trampled nations.

13You headed out to save your people,

to rescue your anointed ones.

You crushed the heads of the wicked

and laid them open from neck to thigh.

14You thrust through the leaders of their troops

with their own spears.

They’d stormed in to scatter us,

celebrating as if running over the poor unchecked.

15But with your horses you tramped down the sea of soldiers,

that surging mighty flood.	Hab 3:12-15

16I heard it and my body trembled;

my lips quivered at the sound.

My knees buckled;

I froze, unable to move;

I’ll wait in silence for distress

to descend on our invaders.

17Though the fir tree hasn’t budded,

and there’re no grapes on the vine,

and the fields aren’t growing any food,

though the flock has scattered from the fold,

and there are no cattle in the stalls,

18I’ll still rejoice in Yahveh

and delight in the salvation he’ll bring me.

19The Lord Yahveh is my strength;

he’s made my feet like deer’s feet

and enables me to walk surefooted on high places.

(For the choir director accompanied by my stringed instruments) 	Hab 3:16-19
