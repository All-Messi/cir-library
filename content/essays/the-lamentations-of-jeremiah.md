THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

Jerusalem Deserted

1:1How lonely the city sits that used to bustle with people!

She’s like a widow that was once great among the nations!

The princess among the provinces has become a slave!

2She cries bitterly at night; tears are on her cheeks.

Nobody among her lovers is there to comfort her.

Her friends have betrayed her

and become her enemies.

3Judah has gone into exile in affliction and hard servitude;

she’s spread out among the nations now

with no resting place.

Her pursuers have caught up with her in the middle of her distress.

4The roads to Zion are in mourning,

because nobody attends the appointed festivals.

Her gates are desolate, her priests groan,

her virgins suffer, and she suffers bitterly herself.	Lam 1:1-4

5Her adversaries have become her masters; her enemies prosper.

Yahveh has made her suffer for her many sins.

Her children have gone away captive to the foe.

6The majesty is gone from Zion;

her officials are like bucks that can’t find pasture;

they’ve fled away weak before their pursuers.

7In her time of suffering and homelessness,

Jerusalem remembers her treasured things from before;

when her people fell to her adversaries and nobody helped her,

the enemies gloated over her and mocked her downfall.

8Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she’s become filthy.

Everybody that honored her before despises her now,

because they’ve seen her nakedness.

She groans and turns away. 	Lam 1:5-8

9Her uncleanness was in her skirts;

she didn’t give any thought for her doom;

so she’s fallen terribly with no comforter.

10The foe has reached out for her treasured things;

she has watched the nations invade her sanctuary,

people you commanded not to enter your community.

11The people are groaning as they look for bread;

they’ve given their treasured things for food to stay alive;

“Look, Yahveh, I’m despised.

12Is it nothing to you that go by?

Look and see if there’s any pain like my pain

that was severely dealt out to me,

that Yahveh inflicted in his fierce anger.	Lam 1:9-12

13He sent fire from on high into my bones, and it descended on them.

He spread a net for my feet and turned me back;

he left me desolate and faint all day long.

14He has tied my sins together into a yoke around my neck;

he has made my strength fail,

and turned me over to those I can’t withstand.

15The Lord has rejected the strong men that are with me;

he has called an appointed time against me to crush my young men;

like a winepress he has trodden down the young virgin Judah.

16I weep for those things; my eyes run down with tears,

because there’s no comforter near to restore my soul.

My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.” 	Lam 1:13-16

17Zion holds out her hands, but there’s no one to comfort her;

Yahveh has commanded against Jacob

that his neighbors would be his enemies;

Jerusalem has become something filthy in their minds.

18“Yahveh is good; I’ve rebelled against his command;

listen now, all you nations, and look at my pain;

my virgins and young men have gone into captivity.

19I called to my lovers, but they deceived me;

my priests and elders perished in the city

as they looked for food to stay alive.

20Look, Yahveh, because I’m in distress; my soul is in turmoil.

My heart’s upset because I’ve been rebellious.

The sword bereaves in the street; it’s like death in the house.	Lam 1:17-20

21They’ve heard that I’m groaning with nobody to comfort me.

My enemies have heard about my trouble;

they’re glad you’ve done it.

Bring the time you’ve promised

and let them be like me.

22Pay attention to their sinfulness,

and deal with them like you’ve dealt with me for my sins.

I groan a lot, and my heart is faint.”	Lam 1:21-22

Destruction for Sin

2:1How the Lord in his anger has covered Zion under a cloud!

He has thrown down Israel’s splendor from heaven to earth;

he hasn’t remembered his footstool in his wrath.

2Without mercy the Lord has swallowed up the residents in Jacob.

In his anger he has thrown down Judah’s fortresses

and leveled the kingdom and its officials to the ground in dishonor.

3In his fury he has cut down Israel’s power

and stopped restraining the enemy.

He has burned like a fire in Jacob

and consumed it everywhere.

4He has bent his bow like an enemy;

he has set his right hand like an adversary

and killed everybody we took pride in.

He has poured out his anger like fire in the tent of Zion.	Lam 2:1-4

5The Lord has become like an enemy;

he has swallowed up Israel,

laid its palaces in ruins,

destroyed its fortresses,

and multiplied mourning and groaning in Judah.

6He’s violently treated his Tabernacle like a garden shed

and laid in ruins his appointed meeting place.

Yahveh has stricken from memory

the appointed festivals and Sabbaths in Zion,

and deposed king and priest in his angry indignation.

7The Lord has rejected his altar, disowned his sanctuary,

and delivered to the enemy the walls of its palaces.

A clamor was raised in Yahveh’s Temple

like that of an appointed festival day.

8Yahveh decided to destroy the wall around Zion.

He stretched out a line

and didn’t restrain his destroying.

He made rampart and wall mourn;

they’ve broken down together.                                         	Lam 2:5-8

9Its gates have sunk into the ground;

he has ruined and broken its bars

and scattered its king and officials among the nations.

There’s no law anymore;

prophets don’t have visions from Yahveh.

10The elders of Zion sit silent on the ground;

they’ve thrown dust on their heads

and wrapped themselves in burlap.

The virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.

11My eyes are worn out from crying;

my spirit is in turmoil;

my heart is poured out on the ground

because my people have been destroyed;

the little ones and babies pass out in the street.

12They ask their mothers, “Where is the bread and wine?”

as they faint like wounded men in the city streets,

as their life dies out on their mother’s chest.	Lam 2:9-12

13What can I say for you?

What can I compare you to, young woman in Jerusalem?

What can I liken you to, as I comfort you, young virgin in Zion?

Your ruin is as wide as the sea; who can restore you?

14Your prophets have deceived you with false visions;

they haven’t exposed your iniquity to restore you from sin;

they’ve seen false, misleading oracles for you.

15Everybody that goes by claps their hands at you;

they gasp and shake their heads at Jerusalem,

“Is this the city they used to say was ‘perfectly beautiful,

a delight to the whole world’?”

16Your enemies mock you;

they scoff and snarl,

and shout, “We’ve swallowed you up!

That’s what we’ve been waiting for;

at last it’s here to see.”	Lam 2:13-16

17Yahveh has accomplished his purpose

and carried out the threat he ordained long ago.

He has destroyed without pity

and enabled your enemies to celebrate over you

and increased the power of your adversaries.

18Their heart appealed to the Lord,

“Resident of Zion, let your tears run down like a river day and night;

don’t give yourself any relief or let your eyes rest.

19Get up, cry out loud at the beginning of the night watches;

pour your heart out like water to the Lord;

lift your hands up to him for the life of your little ones

who are faint from hunger at the end of every street.”

20See, Yahveh, look! Who else have you ever dealt with this way?

Should women eat their offspring, little babies born healthy?

Should prophet and priest be killed in your sanctuary?	Lam 2:17-20

21Young and old lie on the ground in the streets;

my virgins and young men have fallen by the sword.

You’ve slain them in your anger,

slaughtered them without mercy.

22You invited terrors on every side of me as to an appointed festival.

Nobody escaped or survived your anger.

My enemy destroyed the ones I cared for and raised.	Lam 2:21-22

Hope in Yahveh’s Faithfulness

3:1I have seen suffering

under the rod God used in his anger.

2He has driven me out and made me walk in the dark;

3he has turned his hand against me repeatedly all day.

4He made my skin and body waste away,

and broke my bones.	Lam 3:1-4

5He besieged me with bitterness and hardship.

6He made me live in dark places

like the dead from long ago.

7He walled me in so I couldn’t escape

and put heavy chains on me.

8Even when I call for help,

he shuts out my prayer.	Lam 3:5-8

9He has blocked my road with hewn stones

and made my paths crooked.

10He’s like a bear lying in wait for me,

like a lion in unexpected places.

11He dragged me off the road, tore me to pieces;

and made me desolate.

12He bent his bow and made me a target for his arrow;	Lam 3:9-12

13he shot deep into me the arrows from his quiver.

14I’m a laughingstock to my people,

mocked in musical ditties all day.

15He filled me with bitterness

and made me drink wormwood.

16He cracked my teeth with gravel

and made me grovel in the dust.	Lam 3:13-16

17I’ve been set apart from peace

and forget what happiness is like.

18So I say, “My strength is gone,

and so is my hope in Yahveh.”

19Remember my suffering and homelessness.

20I certainly remember

and am humbled within.	Lam 3:17-20

21I recall this and have hope from it:

22Yahveh love never stops coming;

his mercies don’t end.

23His faithfulness is great;

it’s renewed every morning.

24I say to myself, “Yahveh is my portion;

so I have hope in him.”	Lam 3:21-24

25Yahveh is good to those who depend on him,

people that look for him.

26They do well to wait silently for his salvation.

27It’s good for people to bear the yoke when they’re young,

28to sit alone in silence, since God has laid it on them,

29to put their mouth in the dust—maybe there’s hope,

30to turn their cheek to their abuser,

to be filled with disgrace;

31because Yahveh won’t reject forever.	Lam 3:25-31

32If he causes grief, he’ll have mercy

according to his enduring love;

33because he doesn’t willingly hurt people or grieve them.

34-36God doesn’t approve

of crushing every prisoner in the land under his feet,

of depriving people of justice in the presence of the Most High,

of defrauding people in his lawsuit.

37Who is there that speaks and it happens

unless the Lord has commanded it?

38Don’t both good and bad come from the Most High?	Lam 3:32-38

39Why should we complain in light of our sins?

40Let’s examine our ways and return to Yahveh.

41Let’s lift up our heart and hands toward God in heaven;

42we’ve sinned and rebelled; you haven’t pardoned us.

43You’ve covered yourself with anger and chased us;

you’ve slain without pity.

44You’ve wrapped yourself in a cloud

so no prayer can get to you. 	Lam 3:39-44

45You’ve made us residue and refuse among the nations.

46Our enemies rail out against us.

47Panic and pitfall descend on us, devastation and destruction.

48My eyes run with streams of tears

because my people are being destroyed.

49My eyes will keep pouring out

50till Yahveh looks down from heaven and sees.

51My eyes bring pain to my soul

because of all the residents in my city.

52For no reason my enemies hunted me down like a bird;

53they’ve silenced me in the pit, and put a stone over me;

54water closed over my head; I said, “I’m lost.”

55I called to you, Yahveh, from down in the pit. 	Lam 3:45-55

56You heard my plea,

and didn’t hide from my prayer for relief, my call for help.

57You came and said, “Don’t be afraid!”

58Lord, you pled my case and redeemed my life.

59Yahveh, you’ve seen my oppression; judge my case.

60You’ve seen their revenge, their schemes against me.

61You’ve heard their taunts.

62My assailants’ whispers aim at me all day.

63Look at their sitting and rising;

I’m what they mock in their song.

64Pay them back, Yahveh, according to what they’ve done;

65harden their heart so your curse will fall on them.

66Chase them in anger and destroy them from under the sky! 	Lam 3:56-66

Yahveh’s Anger Satisfied

4:1How the gold has tarnished; how pure gold has changed!

The holy stones lie scattered at the beginning of every street.

2The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in gold,

are treated like clay pots that potters make!

3Even jackals nurse their young,

but my people have become cruel like wild ostriches.

4The infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst;

little ones beg for bread, but nobody gives them any.

5People that used to eat delicacies sit desolate in the streets;

the ones brought up in purple lie on ash heaps.

6The iniquity of my people is worse than the sin of Sodom,

which was overthrown without hands in one moment.

7Zion’s Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk,

healthier looking than corals, like polished lapis lazuli.	Lam 4:1-7

8Now they’re darker than soot, not recognizable in the streets;

their skin is shriveled on their bones, withered like wood.

9Those killed with the sword are happier than those slain by hunger;

they pine away, stricken for lack of crops in the field.

10Merciful women boiled their own children;

they became their food because my people were being destroyed.

11Yahveh has accomplished his wrath,

poured out his hot anger

and sparked a fire in Zion that has consumed its foundations.

12The kings of the earth and inhabitants of the region

didn’t believe enemies could get in the gates of Jerusalem. 	Lam 4:8-12

13Because of its prophets’ sins and its priests’ iniquities—

who shed the blood of good people in it—

14they wandered in the streets, blind and defiled with blood

so nobody would even touch their clothes.

15They shouted at them, “Get away! Unclean! Don’t touch!”

So they fled and wandered.

People in the nations said, “They can’t stay here anymore.”

16Yahveh has scattered them;

he won’t continue to care especially about them;

they didn’t honor the priests or bless the elders.	Lam 4:13-16

17Our eyes failed us; looking for help was useless;

we certainly watched for a nation that couldn’t save.

18People dogged our steps so we couldn’t walk in the streets;

our end came near, our days failed, we were through.	Lam 4:17-18

19Our pursuers were faster than eagles in the sky;

they chased us on the mountains and ambushed us in the desert.

20Our very breath, Yahveh’s anointed, was captured in their pits;

we’d said about him, “In his shadow we’ll live among the nations.”

21Celebrate and be happy, Edom that lives in Uz;

the cup will come around to you as well; you’ll be drunk and naked.

22The punishment for your sinfulness is finished, Zion;

he won’t exile you any longer.

But he’ll punish your iniquity, Edom;

he’ll expose your sins!	Lam 4:19-22

Prayer for Restoration

5:1Yahveh, remember what’s happened to us;

look at our disgrace!

2Our inheritance has been turned over to foreigners,

and our houses belong to aliens.

3We’ve become orphans without fathers;

our mothers are like widows.

4We have to pay for drinking water and buy wood.

5Our drivers put yokes on our necks;

we’re worn out; we can’t get any rest.	Lam 5:1-5

6We’ve submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.

7Our fathers sinned, and they’re gone;

but we have to suffer for their sins.

8Slaves rule us; nobody can deliver us from them.

9We risk our lives just getting bread

because of the sword in the open country.

10Our skin is hot like an oven,

because of the burning heat of famine.

11They rape the women in Zion,

and the virgins in the towns in Judah.	Lam 5:6-11

12They hang up officials by their hands,

and show no respect for old men.

13Young men work at the grinding mill;

and stagger under loads of wood.

14Elders are gone from the city gate,

young men have quit their music.

15The joy in our hearts is gone;

our dancing has turned into mourning.

16The crown has fallen from our head;

misfortune awaits us because we’ve sinned!

17Our heart is faint because of it;

our eyes are weak.

18Jackals prowl in desolate Zion. 	Lam 5:12-18

19Yahveh, you rule forever;

your throne goes on for endless generations.

20Why don’t you keep us in mind forever?

Why abandon us so long?

21Restore us to yourself, Yahveh, so we can be restored;

renew our days as of old,

22unless you’ve completely rejected us,

and are really angry with us.	Lam 5:19-22
