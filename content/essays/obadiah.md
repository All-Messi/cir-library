OBADIAH

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1The Vision of Obadiah

Edom’s Judgment Foretold

The Lord Yahveh says this about Edom;

we’ve heard the report;

an ambassador has gone out to the nations to say,

“To arms, attack Edom.”

2“I’ll make you a minor player among the nations

and utterly despised.

3Your arrogance has deceived you,

you that live high in caves

and tell yourselves that nobody can bring you down.

4Though you’ve built high like an eagle

and put your nest among the stars,

I’ll bring you down. 	Obad 1-4

5“If thieves came to you at night—

what disaster awaits you!—

wouldn’t they steal only till they had enough?

If grape pickers came,

wouldn’t they leave some gleanings?

6But how you’ll be pillaged, Esau,

and your hidden treasures found!

7Your allies will force you out of your borders;

the people at peace with you

will turn on you and overpower you;

the ones you eat with

will set up an ambush for you.

(You won’t suspect it.)

8At that time,” Yahveh says, “won’t I destroy

the wise men out of Edom

and those with understanding from Esau’s mountain?

9Your strong troops will be afraid, Teman;

so everybody from Esau’s mountains

will be cut down in the slaughter.	Obad 5-9

Edom’s Violence Against Israel

10“Because of your violence against Jacob your brother,

you’ll be covered with disgrace and permanently eliminated.

11You stood aloof

while foreigners cast lots for Jerusalem

and strangers entered its gates

to carry off its wealth.

You even joined them.

12You shouldn’t have gloated over your brother’s misfortune;

you shouldn’t have celebrated over Judah’s destruction

or boasted about his distress.

13You shouldn’t have entered my people’s gate

at the time of their disaster

or looted their goods during their catastrophe.

14You shouldn’t have stood at the fork in the road

to cut down their refugees

or have betrayed the survivors in their misfortune. 	Obad 10-14

Edom’s Destruction, Israel’s Restoration

15“Yahveh’s judgment is coming on all the nations.

What you’ve done to Israel will be done to you;

your dealings will come back on your own head.

16You and those nations will drink the same punishment

you swallowed on my holy mountain.

You’ll all drink till you drown.

17But on Mount Zion some will escape,

and it’ll be holy;

Jacob’s house will return to reclaim its possession.

18Then Jacob’s house will become a fire,

Joseph’s house a flame,

Esau’s house the stubble.

They’ll set him on fire and burn him up;

there’ll be no survivors in Edom.”

Yahveh has said it.	Obad 15-18

19Then my people in the Negev will take over Esau’s mountains;

the ones in the western foothills will occupy the Philistine plain.

They’ll take over the fields of Ephraim and Samaria;

The people of Benjamin will occupy Gilead.

20Exiles from Israel

will replace the Phoenicians as far north as Zarephath;

the captives from Jerusalem that are in Sepharad [north]

will resettle their towns in the Negev [south].

21All those who were rescuedLXX will go up to Mount Zion

and extend its dominion over Esau’s mountains.

The kingdom will belong to Yahveh.	Obad 19-21
