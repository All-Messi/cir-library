MICAH

Conversational Yahveh Version

1:1A Message from Yahveh to Micah from Moresheth

at the Time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah.

What He Saw About Samaria and Jerusalem

Judgment Against Samaria and Jerusalem

2Listen, every nation;

listen, world and everybody in it.

Let the Lord Yahveh testify against you from his holy Temple.

3He’s coming down from his place

to walk on the mountaintops.

4The mountains will mash down under his feet

and cascade into the valleys—

like wax in fire or

water on a slope.	Mic 1:1-4

5That’s because Jacob rebelled

and Israel sinned.

Where’s Jacob’s rebellion?

Isn’t it in Samaria?

Where’s Judah’s main high place?

Isn’t it in Jerusalem?

6I’ll make Samaria a pile of ruins in the countryside,

a place to plant vineyards.

I’ll drag the stones of its walls down to the valley

and expose its foundations.

7I’ll smash its idols

and burn everything in it.

I’ll destroy its images

because they came from a prostitute’s pay;

that’s all they’ll be.	Mic 1:5-7

8Because of this, I’ll mourn and wail,

and walk around barefoot and naked.

I’ll howl like a jackal

and moan like an owl.

9My people’s wound is too deep to heal;

it’s penetrated into Judah

all the way up to Jerusalem’s gates.

10Don’t “tell” it in Gath;

don’t weep at all;

roll in the “dust” at Beth-leaphrah.

11Just move on into captivity

naked and embarrassed, residents of Shaphir;

the people in Zaaman don’t dare “come outside” its wall;

there’s mourning in Beth-ezel

because its people have no back up. 	Mic 1:8-11

12Those living in Maroth grow weak waiting for relief,

because “bitter” calamity from Yahveh

is reaching the gates of Jerusalem.

13Harness a “team of horses” to a chariot and flee,

people in Lachish, where Zion’s sin came from,

where Israel’s rebellious acts spread from into Judah.

14Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;

the houses in Achzib have “deceived” the kings in Israel.

15I’ll bring a “conqueror” on you, people of Mareshah;

Israel’s leaders will flee to the cave of Adullam.

16Shave off your hair in despair for the children you delight in;

make yourself as bald as an eagle

because they’re going into exile.	Mic 1:12-16

Judgment Against Wealthy Oppressors

2:1Misfortune awaits those who devise sin,

Who lie awake plotting schemes in bed!

In the morning they do them

because they can.

2They covet fields and seize them;

they desire horses and take them.

They rob people

and confiscate the property they’ve inherited.

3So Yahveh says,

“I’m devising a catastrophe for this family;

you won’t get your necks out of the noose.

You won’t keep carrying on arrogantly;

it’ll be a terrible time for you.

4Your enemies will taunt you with a proverb

and wail a bitter dirge in mockery,

‘We’re ruined!

God is reapportioning our things.

He’s taking them away from us

and giving our fields to apostates!’

5So you won’t have anyone stretching out a surveying line

for you by lot in Yahveh’s assembly.	Mic 2:1-5

6“‘Don’t preach about such things,’ they say;

‘disgrace won’t catch up with us.’

7Are you really saying such a thing, House of Jacob?

Isn’t Yahveh’s Spirit patient?

Does he do such things?

Don’t his words do good

for those who do right?

8My people rise up against my people;

they strip robes off the peaceful,

off of people that go along innocently

with no thought of fighting.

9They evict my people’s women from their pleasant homes

and forever strip away from their children

the splendor I would give them.

10Get up and get out of here!

this is no longer a place to rest;

there’s sinfulness here

that brings painful destruction.

11If a liar full of hot air tells you

he’ll preach about the fun of wine and alcohol,

he’ll certainly get a hearing from you!	Mic 2:6-11

12“I’ll assemble you, Jacob, remnant of Israel,

and put you together like sheep in a fold;

like a flock in its pasture,

you’ll be a noisy crowd in your land.

13The One that opens the gate will lead you out;

you’ll break out of exile through it.

Your King will go out ahead of you,

Yahveh at the lead.” 	Mic 2:12-13

Judgment Against Israel’s Leaders

3:1I said,

“Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel.

Aren’t you supposed to know what’s good,

2you that hate good and love evil,

who skin my people alive,

pull the meat off their bones,

3eat their flesh,

break up their bones in pieces,

and chop them up for the pot

like meat in a kettle?”

4You’ll call out to Yahveh,

but he won’t answer you;

he’ll turn away from you

because of all your sins.	Mic 3:1-4

5Yahveh says this about you prophets

that mislead my people:

“When you have something to eat,

you prophesy peace;

But you declare holy war against anyone

that doesn’t feed you.

6Consequently, you’ll have nights without visions,

darkness without fortunetelling.

The sun will set on you prophets;

the day will get dark over you.

7You seers will be put to shame;

you fortunetellers will be disgraced.

You’ll have to cover your mouths in humiliation

because I won’t answer you.”

8But I’m filled with power—

with the Spirit of Yahveh—

with justice and courage

to declare to Jacob his transgression,

to Israel his sin.	Mic 3:5-8

9Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel,

who abhor justice and twist the truth,

10who build Zion with bloodshed

and Jerusalem with violence.

11You leaders render verdicts for a bribe;

you priests teach for hire;

you prophets tell fortunes for money.

Yet you want to rely on Yahveh and say,

“Yahveh’s with us, right?

Catastrophe won’t happen to us.”

12So, because of you,

they’ll plow Zion like a field;

Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins;

the Temple mount will be a full-grown forest. 	Mic 3:9-12

The Mountain of Yahveh

4:1In the last days,

the mountain Yahveh’s Temple’s on

will be the tallest mountain.

It will loom above the hills,

and the people from many nations will stream to it.

2They’ll say,

“Let’s go up to Yahveh’s mountain,

to the Temple of Jacob’s God,

so he can teach us his ways,

and we can follow in his paths.”

The Law will go out from Zion,

Yahveh’s message from Jerusalem.

3He’ll mediate between many nations

and settle disputes between powerful countries far away.

They’ll hammer their swords into plowshares

and their spears into pruning hooks.

Nation won’t attack nation

or train for war anymore.

4Everyone will sit under their own vine and fig tree,

and nobody will make them afraid;

the LORDY has said so.	Mic 4:1-4

5The nations conduct themselves

in the name of their gods;

we will follow Yahveh our God forever.

Israel’s Future Rescue from Exile

6“At that time,” Yahveh says,								“I’ll assemble the lame

and gather the exiles that I’ve oppressed.

7I’ll make the lame a remnant

and the outcasts a powerful nation.

I’ll reign over them on Mount Zion permanently.

8Your former dominion will revert to you,

tower of the flock, hill of Zion, kingdom of Jerusalem.	Mic 4:5-8

9“Now why are you crying out?

Don’t you have a king?

Has your advisor perished

and agony seized you as in childbirth?

10Writhe and groan, inhabitant of Zion,

like a woman in labor,

because you’ll leave the city

to live in open country,

and go to Babylon.

But I’ll rescue you

and redeem you from your enemies there.

11Now many nations have gathered against you, saying,

‘Let’s desecrate it;

let’s take pride in destroying Zion.’

12But they don’t know what I’m thinking

or understand my purpose,

because I’m going to gather them up

like bundles for a threshing floor.

13Get up and thresh, Zion.

I’ll give you iron horns and bronze hoofs

so you can pulverize many nations

and the wealth of their unjust gain you can devote to me,

the Lord of the whole world.	Mic 4:9-13

A Promised Ruler from Bethlehem

5:1“Muster your troops, Jerusalem;

they’re laying siege against you;

they’ll hit Israel’s leader in the face with a rod.

2But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,

though you’re small among Judah’s clans,

you’ll have a ruler come out of you on my behalf in Israel.

His origins are from long ago, from ancient times.”

3Israel will be abandoned

till the one that’s in labor has the child;

then the rest of his relatives

will come back from exile.

4He’ll stand up and shepherd his flock

with the power and majesty of Yahveh his God;

they’ll be able to remain secure

because at that time he’ll be great everywhere.

5He’ll give us peace.	Mic 5:1-5a

When the Assyrians invade our land

and overrun our fortresses,

we’ll fight back

with seven shepherds, eight princes leading us.

6They’ll shepherd Assyria with the sword,

Nimrod’s land with swords drawn.

Yahveh will deliver us from them

when they attack our land

and try to tramp all over our territory.

A Remnant to Be Delivered

7Then the remnant of Jacob left in the land

will live among many nations

like dew from Yahveh,

like showers on grass

that mortals can’t restrain,

that no one can delay. 	Mic 5:5b-7

8The remnant left in Jacob

will live among many nations

like a young lion in a flock of sheep.

He mauls and mangles as he goes;

no one can stop him.

9He’ll raise his hand against his enemies

and wipe them out.

10“At that time,” Yahveh says,

“I’ll get rid of your horses

and destroy your chariots.

11I’ll demolish your towns

and tear down your defenses.

12I’ll abolish sorcery;

you won’t have fortunetellers anymore.

13I’ll get rid of your carved images and sacred pillars

so you won’t worship what you’ve made.

14I’ll pull up your Asherah poles

and destroy your pagan cities.

15I’ll carry out angry revenge

on nations that refuse to obey.”	Mic 5:8-15

Yahveh’s Case Against Israel

6:1Listen to what Yahveh says:

“Present to the mountains your case against me;

let the hills hear your complaint.

2But then listen, mountains, to Yahveh’s complaint,

you enduring foundations of the world.

He has a suit against his people;

he’ll bring charges against Israel.

3“What have I done to you, my people?

How have I wearied you? Answer me.

4I brought you out of Egypt

and ransomed you from slavery.

I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you,

5My people, remember now

the curse that Balak, king of Moab, proposed,

the blessing that Balaam Ben-Beor answered with,

the laws that led you from Shittim to Gilgal,

so you could learn about myY faithfulness.” 	Mic 6:1-5

6What should I bring to Yahveh?

What should I bow with before God on high?

Should I come to him with burnt offerings

and yearling calves?

7Does Yahveh delight in thousands of rams,

in 10,000 rivers of olive oil?

Am I to present my firstborn for my transgression,

the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

8No, he’s told you what’s good:

what does Yahveh require from you

but to do good, love kindness,

and walk humbly with him?	Mic 6:6-8

Israel’s Guilt and Punishment

9Yahveh will call out to the city—

it’s wise to respect him—

“Listen, tribe and city council.

10Can I overlook the wealth gained from cheating

that’s in sinners’ houses

and the short measure that’s accursed?

11Can I acquit a businessman that uses dishonest scales

and a bag of false weights?

12The rich in the city extort;

its residents lie and deceive.	Mic 6:9-12

13So I’ll send diseases to strike you down,

and bring you to ruin for your sins.

14You’ll eat, but you won’t be satisfied;

there’ll be hunger among you.

You’ll store up for safe keeping,

but I’ll deliver most of it to the sword.

15You’ll plant, but not harvest;

you’ll tread olives, but not anoint yourself with the oil;

you’ll tread grapes, but not drink the wine.

16You’ve followed the statutes of sinful Omri

and the example of Ahab;

you’ve taken their advice.

So I’ll deliver you to destruction

and your people to ridicule;

you’ll endure the nations’ scorn.”	Mic 6:13-16

Israel’s Misery Turned to Hope

7:1Misfortune is waiting for me!

I feel like people that pick fruit and gather grapes

but have no clusters to eat

or first-ripe figs to satisfy their hunger.

2Godly people have disappeared;

there aren’t any good ones left.

They all premeditate murder;

each hunts the other with a net.

3Both hands do evil well,

officials and judges both demand bribes,

influential people vie for preferential treatment;

together they weave injustice.	Mic 7:1-3

4The best of them are like briars;

the most godly are like a thorn hedge.

They can post a watchman,

but their punishment will still come;

their confusion is at hand.

5Don’t trust your neighbor,

don’t confide in a friend,

be careful what you tell your wise

6Son treats father with contempt;

daughter defies mother,

daughter-in-law defies mother-in-law;

people have enemies in their own families.	Mic 7:4-6

7But I will look to Yahveh;

I’ll wait for God, who keeps me safe.

He’ll listen to me.

8Don’t gloat over me, adversary.

Though I fall, I’ll get up;

though I live in the dark, Yahveh’s my light.	Mic 7:7-8

9I’ll bear Yahveh’s indignation

because admittedly I’ve sinned against him;

then he’ll give me justice against my enemy.

He’ll bring me out to the light,

and I’ll be able to see his goodness.

10As a result, my enemy will see it too

and be put to shame who said,

“Where’s Yahveh your God?”

I’ll watch while he’s tramped on

like dirt on a road.

11It’ll be a time, Israel, for rebuilding your walls

and extending your boundaries,

12a day when people come to you

from Assyria and the cities of Egypt—

from Egypt to the Euphrates,

from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.

13But first the land will become desolate

because of what its people have done.	Mic 7:9-13

14Shepherd your people with your staff,

your flock that lives alone in a woods

surrounded by productive fields.

Let them pasture in Bashan and Gilead

like they did in the old days.

15“I’ll show you amazing miracles

like I did when you came out of Egypt.”

16Nations will see them

and be embarrassed at their own weakness.

They’ll put their hand over their mouth in awe,

and their ears will pop.

17They’ll lick dust like a snake,

like a reptile in the dirt.

They’ll come cringing out of their fortresses

and turn to Yahveh our God.	Mic 7:14-17

Yahveh’s Compassion for Israel

18What God is like you, that pardons sin

and passes over the rebellious acts

the remnant of his permanent possession has done?

19You’ll show us mercy again,

tread our iniquities underfoot,

throw our sins in the sea.

20You’ll show covenant faithfulness to Jacob,

enduring love to Abraham

like you swore to our ancestors so long ago.	Mic 7:18-20
