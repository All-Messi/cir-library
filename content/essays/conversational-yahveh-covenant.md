JOB

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1Job lived in the land of Uz, a blameless, godly man that respected God and shunned evil. 2He had seven sons and three daughters; 3and owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys; and many servants. 4His sons would hold feasts in each other’s houses and invite their three sisters. 5When the feasting days had completed their cycle, Job would consecrate them, getting up early and offering burnt offerings for each one, “Maybe my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.”

6One day when the sons of God came to present themselves to Yahveh, Satan came too. 7Yahveh asked him,

“Where’d you come from?”

“From roaming around in the world.”

8“Have you noticed my servant Job? There’s nobody in the world like him, a blameless, godly man that respects me and shuns evil.”

9“Does he respect you for nothing? 10Haven’t you planted a hedge around him, his home, and everything he owns? You’ve blessed his work, and his possessions have increased in the world. 11Reach out and touch everything he has, and he’ll curse you to your face.”

12“Everything he has is under your authority. Just don’t do anything to him.”

So Satan left.	  Job 1:1-12

13One day when his sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother’s house, 14a messenger came to Job, “The oxen were plowing, the donkeys were feeding alongside them, 15and the Sabeans attacked and stole them. They killed the servants with the sword. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.” 16While he was still talking, another servant came, “God’s fire fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.” 17While he was still talking, another servant came, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, and raided the camels, stole them, and killed the servants with the sword. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.” 18While he was still talking, another servant came,

“Your sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother’s house. 19A violent gale from the desert demolished the house. It collapsed on the young people and killed them. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.”							Job 1:13-19

20Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; he fell on the ground and worshiped,

21 “I came naked from my mother’s womb,

and I’ll leave naked.

Yahveh gave and Yahveh has taken away.

Bless Yahveh.”

22Through all that, Job didn’t sin by blaming God.                        	   Job 1:20-22

2:1On another day when the sons of God came to present themselves to Yahveh, Satan came with them. 2Yahveh asked him,

“Where’d you come from?”

“From roaming around in the world.”

3“Have you noticed my servant Job? There’s nobody like him in the world, a blameless, godly man that respects me and shuns evil. He still maintains his integrity, even though you incited me against him to ruin him for no reason.”

4“Skin for skin! Everything mortalsm have they’ll give for their life. 5Reach out and touch his flesh and bone, and he’ll curse you to your face.”

6“He’s under your authority. Just don’t take his life.”

7Satan went out from Yahveh and struck Job with sore boils from the top of his head to the sole of his feet. 8He was using a potsherd to scrape himself, sitting in ashes.

9His wife said, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Curse God and die!”

10But he told her, “You talk like a foolish woman. Will we accept good from God and not adversity?”

In all that, Job didn’t sin in what he said.		  Job 2:1-10

11His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite heard about all the terrible things that had happened to him. They made an appointment together to come and sympathize with him and comfort him. 12When they looked up from a distance and didn’t recognize him, they wailed loudly, tore their robes, and threw dust over their heads. 13They sat down on the ground with him for seven days and nights without saying a word, because they saw he was in so much pain.	  Job 2:11-13

3:1Afterward Job cursed the day he was born: [2]

3“Perish the day I was born,

the night I was conceived.

4May that be a dark day;

let God above not care about it

or any light shine on it.

5Let darkness and gloom claim it,

dark clouds cover it, and darkness make it terrifying.

6Let darkness seize that night;

let it not celebrate among the days of the year

or be counted among the months.

7Let that night be barren,

and no joyful shout be heard in it.

8Let them curse it who curse the daytime,

who dare to arouse Leviathan.

9Let its morning stars be blacked out;

let it hope for light, but not get any,

or see the eyelids of the morning;

10because it didn’t shut my mother’s womb

or hide trouble from me.	Job 3:1-10

11“Why didn’t I die at birth—

just come out of the womb and die?

12Why did the knees receive me

and the breasts that nursed me?

13Then I would’ve lain down in peace;

I would’ve slept and been at rest

14with kings and advisors

that rebuilt ruins for themselves,

15with rulers that had gold

and filled their houses with silver.

16Why wasn’t I a miscarriage that was discarded,

that never saw the light of day?

17Sinners stop raging in death,

and the weary rest.

18Captives are at ease together;

they don’t hear a taskmaster.

19The least and the greatest are there;

slaves are free from their masters.	Job 3:11-19

20“Why does light come to those who are suffering,

and life to the bitter;

21to people who long for death and it doesn’t come,

who dig for it more than for hidden treasure;

22who celebrate greatly,

glad to find the grave?

23Why is light given to someone with no future,

someone God has hemmed in with difficulties?

24I sigh at the sight of food

and pour out groans like water;

25because what I’m afraid of comes at me,

and what I dread happens to me.

26I’m not at ease, I’m not at peace;

I’m not at rest; only trouble is coming.”	Job 3:20-26

4:1Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

2“Will you be offended if someone offers you advice?

Who can help speaking up?

3You’ve admonished many people

and encouraged the weak.

4What you’ve said has helped the tottering stand

and weak knees hold firm.

5But now difficulty has come to you,

and you’re impatient and distressed.

6Isn’t your reverence for God your confidence,

and the integrity of your ways your hope?	Job 4:1-6

7“Think now, who ever perished that was innocent?

Where were the godly ever destroyed?

8In my experience, those who plow sin

and sow trouble, reap it.

9They perish by God’s breath;

a blast of his anger consumes them.

10A lion roars; it can roar loud;

but even the teeth of a young lion can be broken.

11A lion perishes because there’s no prey,

and the cubs of a lioness scatter.	Job 4:7-11

12“A message crept in quietly to me;

I heard it whisper.

13In my dreams at night when deep sleep comes,

14dread overwhelmed me, and I trembled all over.

15A spirit glided by my face

and made my hair stand up.

16It stood still,

but I couldn’t make out what it looked like;

a form hovered in front of me;

everything was quiet; then I heard a voice:

17‘Can mortals be good in God’s presence?

Can they be as pure as their Maker?

18God doesn’t trust his own servants;

he even brings charges against his angels,

19much more those who live in clay houses,

whose foundations lie in dust,

who get crushed as easy as a moth!

20In one day they’re broken to pieces;

they perish forever without anyone noticing.

21Isn’t their tent-rope pulled up inside them?

They die in ignorance.’	Job 4:12-21

5:1“Call out for help now; will anybody answer you?

Which of the angels will you turn to?

2Adversity slays the foolish;

anger kills the simpleminded.

3I’ve seen the foolish taking root

and having their progress immediately cursed.

4Their children are never safe,

they’re oppressed in the courts,

and there’s nobody to deliver them.

5The hungry eat up their harvest;

briers take over it;

schemers are eager to get their wealth;

6because adversity doesn’t sprout from the dirt,

and trouble doesn’t grow out of the ground.	 Job 5:1-6

7“Mortals are born for trouble

like sparks fly up from burning wood.

8“I would seek God;

I’d place my cause in front of him

9who does great, unsearchable things,

wonders without number.

10He sends rain

to water the fields.

11He sets the humble up high

and lifts mourners to safety.

12He frustrates devious plots

so they can’t succeed.

13He catches the wise in their own shrewdness

and quickly thwarts wily people’s schemes.

14They run into darkness in the daytime

and grope at noon as at night.

15But he saves people from the sword

and the poor from the powerful.

16So the helpless have hope;

the sinful have to shut their mouths.	Job 5:7-16

17“How happy they are that God corrects;

so don’t despise discipline by the Almighty,

18because he inflicts pain but gives relief,			he wounds in order to heal.

19He’ll deliver you from six troubles;

even in seven, tragedy won’t touch you.

20In famine he’ll redeem you from death;

in war he’ll save you from the sword.

21He’ll hide you from the scourge of the tongue;

you won’t panic when violence comes.

22You’ll laugh at destruction and famine;

wild animals won’t scare you. 			Job 5:17-22

23You’ll be at peace with the rocks in the field;

the wild animals will be at peace with you.

24You’ll know your tent is secure;

you’ll inventory your holdings and find nothing missing.

25You’ll have lots of children,

offspring like grass on the ground.

26You’ll come to your grave at a ripe old age,

like a bundle of wheat at harvest time.

27We’ve examined this and found it’s true;

listen to it for your own good.”	Job 5:23-27

6:1Job answered:

2“Oh that my adversity was properly weighed

in the balances with my sins!

3It would outweigh the sand by the seashore;

that’s why I’ve been rash.

4The arrows of the Almighty are piercing me;

my spirit is absorbing their poison;

God’s terrors are attacking me.

5Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass?

Does an ox bawl over its hay?

6Does anyone eat tasteless food without salting it?

Is there any flavor in egg whites?

7My mouth won’t touch them;

they’re disgusting to me.	Job 6:1-7

8“Oh that I could receive what I ask for,

that God would grant me what I long for!

9Oh that he’d be willing to crush me,

that he’d reach out and kill me!

10This is my consolation:

I can take comfort in my unsparing pain

because I haven’t denied the words of the Holy One.

11I don’t have enough strength to endure.

What hope do I have that I should be patient?

12Am I as hard as rock?

Is my body as firm as bronze?

13I can’t get any help from inside me;

I can’t deliver myself.				Job 6:8-13

14“Friends should be kind to people in despair;

otherwise, they’ll lose reverence for the Almighty.

15My brothers have been unreliable,

like water in wadis you can’t depend on.

16Now they’re turbulent with melting ice and snow;

17now they’re dry and silent;

when it’s hot, they stop running.

18Their course winds into wasteland and disappears.

19Caravans from Tema look for them;

travelers from Sheba hope to find them.

20They’re disappointed;

when they arrive, they’re frustrated.

21You’ve been like that to me;

you see my misfortune and get scared.

22Have I said, ‘Give me something’;

‘pay a ransom for me from your wealth’;

23‘deliver me from my adversary’;

or ‘ransom me from oppressors’?	Job 6:14-23

24“Teach me and I’ll be quiet;

show me where I’m wrong.

25Honest words carry force,

but what does your criticism show?

26Do you think you can rebuke me

by treating my despairing words like wind?

27You’d cast lots for orphans

and barter your friend!

28Look me in the eye;

am I’m lying to your face?

29Just stop supposing I’ve done something wrong;

my good reputation is at stake here.

30Has there been anything false about what I’ve said?

Can’t I distinguish guilt from disaster?	Job 6:24-30

7:1“Aren’t people forced into hard labor?

Aren’t their days like those of a hired hand?

2Like a slave panting for shade,

like an employee waiting for wages,

3I’ve been allotted months of emptiness

and given restless nights.

4When I‘m in bed, I say, ‘When is morning ever going to get here?’

But night goes on and on, and I toss and turn till dawn.

5My body is covered with maggots and scabs;

my skin hardens and breaks open and festers.	Job 7:1-5

6“My days fly by faster than a weaver’s shuttle

and end without hope.

7“Remember that my life is only a breath, God;

I won’t see good times again.

8People won’t see me for long

because I’ll be gone.

9Like a dissipating cloud,

those who go down to Sheol don’t come up again.

10They won’t come home

or ever be seen again.		Job 7:6-10

11“So I won’t hold back;

I’ll speak with anguished spirit;

I’ll complain from my bitter soul.

12Am I the sea or a sea monster

that you set a guard over me?

13If I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,

my couch will ease my discomfort,’

14then you scare me with dreams

and terrify me with nightmares;

15so I’d have chosen strangulation

and death instead of these pains.

16I’m wasting away; I won’t live forever;

leave me alone; my life is just a breath.		Job 7:11-16

17“What are people that you pay so much attention to them,

that you concern yourself with them,

18that you examine them every morning

and test them all day?

19Won’t you ever look the other way

or let me alone long enough to swallow?

20Have I sinned? What have I ever done to you

that you keep hounding me?

Why do you target me

and burden yourself with me?

21Why don’t you just pardon my sin,

take away my guilt?

Soon I’ll lie down in the ground and die;

you’ll look for me, but I wouldn’t be there.”	Job 7:17-21

8:1Bildad the Shuhite answered:

2“How long will you talk like that?

You make your mouth a blustering wind?

3Does God pervert justice?

Does the Almighty twist the truth?

4When your children sinned against him,

he delivered them to the consequences of their sin.

5If you look for God and beg for mercy from the Almighty,

6if you’re pure and just,

he’ll certainly act on your behalf

and restore you to your good position.

7Though you started with little,

you’ll end up with a lot.		Job 8:1-7

8“Ask previous generations

and find out what the ancestors learned;

9we’re only like yesterday and don’t know much;

our short time on earth has been like a shadow.

10Won’t they teach you

and offer their thoughts?		Job 8:8-10

11“Can papyrus grow where there’s no marsh?

Can reeds grow without water?

12While they’re still growing and not ready to be cut,

they wither sooner than grass.

13The paths of everyone that forgets God are like that;

the hopes of godless people perish.

14What they depend on breaks down;

what they trust is like a spider’s web.

15They trust it, but it doesn’t hold firm;

when they take hold of it, it mashes in their hand.

16It’s like a lush plant that thrives in the sunshine

and spreads its shoots across the garden,

17whose roots twine around a rock pile

and grow among the stones.

18But if it’s pulled loose,

you can’t tell it was ever there.

19That’s the extent of its ‘joy’;

others sprout up to replace it.	Job 8:11-19

20“God doesn’t reject blameless people

or give sinners a hand.

21Yet he’ll fill your mouth with laughter,

your lips with shouting.

22In the end, those who hate you he’ll cover with disgrace;

the tents of sinners won’t exist anymore.”	Job 8:20-22

9:1Job answered:

2“I know that’s true,

but how can anyone be innocent in God’s sight?

3If you wanted to dispute with him,

you couldn’t answer him once in a thousand times.

4He’s so wise and powerful;

who has ever defied him and succeeded?	Job 9:1-4

5“It’s God that moves mountains;

they don’t know it when he overturns them in his anger.

6He can shake the earth and make its pillars tremble;

7he can tell the sun not to rise and the stars not to shine.

8He alone stretched out the sky

and tramped on the ocean waves.

9He made the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades,

and constellations in the southern hemisphere.

10He does great, unimaginable things,

countless amazing deeds. 				Job 9:5-10

11“If he passes by me, I don’t see him;

if he goes by, I can’t sense him.

12He snatches away; who can stop him?

Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’

13God won’t turn away his anger;

Rahab’s helpers cower below him.		Job 9:11-13

14“How then can I answer him

or argue with him?

15Even if I were innocent, I couldn’t answer him;

I’d have to appeal to my accuser for mercy.

16If I called and he answered me,

I wouldn’t expect him to pay attention to me.

17He attacks me with a storm

and multiplies my wounds for no reason.

18He won’t let me catch my breath,

but saturates me with bitterness.

19If it’s a matter of power, look at him!

If it’s a matter of justice, who can sue him?

20Though I’m good, my mouth will condemn me;

though I’m innocent, it’ll pronounce me guilty. 	Job 9:14-20

21“I’m innocent, but it doesn’t matter;

I despise my life.

22Innocent and guilty are the same to him; so I say,

‘He destroys the innocent with the guilty.’

23When disaster brings sudden death,

he mocks innocent people’s despair.

24The earth has been turned over to sinners;

he blinds the eyes of his judges.

If it’s not him, who is it?				Job 9:21-24

25“Now my days go past faster than a runner;

they hurry away; they don’t see anything good.

26They slip by like a reed skiff,

like an eagle swooping on prey.

27If I say, ‘I’ll forget about my complaint;

I’ll leave my sad countenance and be cheerful,’

28I’m afraid of my sufferings;

I know he won’t declare me innocent.

29He’ll condemn me anyway;

why should I try for nothing?

30Even if I wash myself with snow

and clean my hands with lye,

31he’d still throw me into a pit;

even my clothes would abhor me.		Job 9:25-31

32“He’s not a mortal like me that I can argue with,

that I could go to court against.

33There’s no mediator between us

that could hold us apart.

34Let him take his rod away from me;

don’t let my dread of him terrify me.

35Then I’d speak without fearing him,

but I can’t do that on my own.	Job 9:32-35

10:1“I detest my life;

so I’ll fully vent my complaint

and speak out of my total frustration.

2I’ll tell God, ‘Don’t just condemn me;

tell me why you’re contending with me.

3Is it right for you to oppress me, to reject my toil,

to look favorably on sinners’ schemes?

4Do you just have physical eyes

and only see like people see?

5Are your days like a mortal’s,

your years like a human’s,

6that you should look all around for my guilt

and search diligently for my every sin?

7You know I’m not guilty;

yet nobody can deliver me from you.	Job 10:1-7

8“‘You fashioned me and made me;

now you want to kill me?

9Remember, you made me out of clay;

you want to turn me back to dust?

10Didn’t you pour me out like milk,

curdle me like cheese,

11dress me in skin and flesh,

knit me together with bones and tendons?

12You’ve granted me enduring love

and preserved my spirit with your care;

13yet you hid other things in your heart too.

I know that was your real purpose.	Job 10:8-13

14If I sin, you mark me

and won’t acquit me.

15If I’m sinful, misfortune awaits me!

Even if I’m good, I dare not hold my head up

because I still feel ashamed and look miserable.

16If I do hold my head up, you hunt me down like a lion

and show me how powerful you are.

17You multiply your accusations against me;

you increase your anger at me

and bring hardship after hardship on me.

18Why let me be born?

I wish I’d died and nobody’d seen me!

19It would have been like I never existed,

carried from the womb to the tomb.’	Job 10:14-19

20“‘Couldn’t you have left my few days alone

and stayed away from me so I could have a little cheer

21before I leave permanently

for the land of darkness and deep shadow,

22the realm of gloom and doom,

where darkness is as intense as light at noon?’”	Job 10:20-22

11:1Zophar the Naamathite answered:

2“Should your barrage of words go unchallenged,

and you exonerate yourself by talking a lot?

3Will your babble shut people up?

Will you mock and nobody rebuke you?

4You claim your beliefs are pure

and you’re innocent in God’s presence;

5but I just wish God would speak out against you

6and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom,

because sound wisdom is not simple;

be assured that God doesn’t remember

just one part of your sin. 	Job 11:1-6

7“Can you find out the deep things of God

or probe the limits of the Almighty?

8They’re higher than the sky—what can you do?

They’re deeper than Sheol—what can you know?

9They measure longer than the world

and wider than the sea.

10If he passes through or imprisons

or calls to judgment, who can stop him?

11He knows worthless people;

he knows about their sin without having to investigate.

12A stupid man can no more become intelligent

than a wild donkey can have a baby. 	Job 11:7-12

13“If you set your heart right,

you can raise your hands and pray to him.

14If there’s sin in you, get rid of it;

don’t let it live in your house.

15Then you can hold your head up,

be steadfast and unafraid.

16You can forget your misery

and remember it like water gone by.

17Your life will become brighter than noonday;

darkness will be like morning.

18Then you’ll have confidence because of hope,

be protected, and rest in safety.

19You’ll lie down, and no one will disturb you;

others will ask for your blessing.

20But the eyes of sinners will be blinded;

they can’t escape;

their only hope is death.”		Job 11:13-20

12:1Job answered:

2“No doubt, you’re the people,

and wisdom will die with you!

3But I’m as smart as you are;

I’m not your inferior.

Who doesn’t know things like that?

4I’m a laughingstock to my friends,

one who called on God and he answered,

a just and blameless man;

yet I’m a laughingstock.

5In the thoughts of people at ease,

there’s contempt for disaster;

they’re ready to give a shove to those whose feet are slipping.

6Destroyers prosper;

those who provoke God may feel secure,

but he’ll bring them under his control.	Job 12:1-6

7“Ask the animals, they’ll teach you;

the birds will explain.

8Speak to the earth; it will inform you;

have the fish in the sea tell you.

9Who among them doesn’t know

that Yahveh has brought this disaster on me?

10The life of every living thing lies in his hand,

including the breath of each person.

11Doesn’t the ear test words

like the palate tastes food?

12Old people have wisdom;

long life brings insight. 		Job 12:7-12

13“He has wisdom and power;

counsel and insight lie in him.

14He tears down, and no one can rebuild;

he shuts people in, and nobody can release them.

15If he withholds water, things dry up;

if he sends it, the land floods.

16Strength and sound wisdom lie in him;

deceived and deceiver are under his control.

17He makes advisors walk barefoot

and makes fools out of judges.

18He takes off kings’ belts

and binds their waists with a rope.	Job 12:13-18

19He makes priests walk barefoot

and overthrows those who feel secure.

20He silences the ones that people trust

and takes away the discernment of elders.

21He pours contempt on nobles

and disarms the strong.

22He reveals what’s deep in the dark

and brings darkness into light.

23He makes nations great, then destroys them;

he enlarges nations, then lets them go into exile.

24He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people

and makes them wander in pathless desolation.

25They grope in the dark with no light;

he makes them stagger like drunks.		Job 12:19-25

13:1“I’ve seen that;

I’ve heard it and understand it.

2What you know, I know too;

I’m not more ignorant than you.	Job 13:1-2

3“But I’m willing to speak to the Almighty himself;

I want to argue with God.

4You men are smearing me with things that aren’t true;

you’re untrained doctors.

5Oh that you’d just be quiet

and show your wisdom that way!

6Hear me out;

listen to what I’m arguing.

7Will you lie to defend God?

Will you speak deceitfully on his behalf?

8Will you favor him by how you testify?

Will you argue his case for him?	Job 13:3-8

9How will you fare when he examines you?

Will you try to deceive him like you deceive people?

10He’ll rebuke you for sure

if you secretly skew your testimony to favor him.

11Doesn’t his majesty terrify you,

and the dread of him fall on you?

12Your memorable sayings are proverbs made of ashes,

defenses made of clay.		Job 13:9-12

13“Be quiet so I can talk;

then let come on me what may.

14Why should I bite my body

and take my life in my hands?

15Even if he kills me, I’ll trust him;

but I’ll still defend myself to him.

16That will also be to my salvation

because godless people can’t approach him.

17Listen carefully to what I’m saying;

let what I’m claiming fill your minds.

18I’ve prepared my case;

I know I’ll be acquitted.

19Will you defeat me in this argument?

If so, I’ll shut up and die.		Job 13:13-19

20“Just grant me two things, God;

then I can face you:

21don’t remove your hand from me

or let my dread of you terrify me.

22Then call and I’ll answer;

or let me speak, then reply to me.

23How many iniquities do I have?

Tell me what my rebellions are.

24Why do you hide from me

and treat me like your enemy?

25Do you make a driven leaf tremble

or chase dry chaff?

26You list bitter accusations against me

and charge me with sins from my youth.

27You put my feet in shackles

and hover over the path as I walk.

You set a boundary for where I could go

28while I was decaying like something rotten,

like a moth-eaten shirt.		Job 13:20-28

14:1“Mortals born of women

are short-lived and filled with turmoil.

2They come out and wither like a flower;

they pass away like a shadow and don’t last.

3You keep your eyes open at them

and bring them under your judgment.

4Who can make unclean into clean?

Nobody!

5Since their days are set,

you determine the number of their months

and set limits they can’t pass.

6Turn your gaze away so they can relax

and finish their day in peace like a hired hand.	Job 14: 1-6

7“There’s hope for a tree when it’s cut down

that it will sprout again and grow new branches.

8Though its roots grow old in the ground

and its stump dies in the dry soil,

9at the scent of water it revives

and puts out new sprouts like a plant.

10But people die and just lie there;

they expire; where are they?

11As water evaporates from the sea

and a river dries up,

12people lie down and don’t get up.

Until the sky ceases to be,

they don’t wake up.		Job 14:7-12

13“Oh that you’d hide me in Sheol,

that you’d conceal me till your anger’s over,

that you’d set a limit on it for me and remember me!

14Can the dead live again?

I’d have hope, then, all the days I struggle

till my release came.

15You’d call and I’d answer;

you’d look forward to what I’d do,

16because then you’d number my steps

instead of counting my sins.

17You’d seal up my sin in a bag

and wrap up my iniquity.		Job 14:13-17

18“Like a mountain crumbles and falls

and a rock slides from its place,

19like water erodes stone

and its torrents wash away soil,

so you destroy people’s hope.

20You overpower them and they pass away;

you disfigure them and send them off.

21If their offspring achieve honor, they don’t know it;

if they’re insignificant, they’re not aware of it.

22They feel only the pains in their own body

and mourn only for themselves.”	Job 14:18-22

15:1Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

2“Should you answer with empty talk

and fill yourself with the east wind?

3Should you argue with useless speech,

with words that do no good?

4You’re losing reverence for God

and hindering meditation in front of him.

5Your sin is telling you what you say,

and you’re choosing misleading language.

6You condemn yourself; I don’t;

you’re testifying against yourself.	Job 15:1-6

7“Were you the first person ever born?

Were you brought forth before the hills?

8Can you hear God’s secret counsel?

Do you think you’re the only one that’s wise?

9What do you know that we don’t know?

What do you understand that we don’t?

10There are gray-haired, aged men around here

that are older than your father.

11Are God’s consolations too small for you

or spoken too gently to you?	Job 15:7-11

12Why does your heart carry you away?

Why do your eyes flash

13that you turn against God,

and say such things?

14Can mortals be pure?

Who born of women can be good?

15God doesn’t even trust his angels absolutely

or regard the sky as perfectly pure.

16How much less someone disgusting and corrupt

that drinks sin like water!	Job 15:12-16

17“Listen, I’ll tell you something;

I’ll tell you what I’ve seen—

18what the wise have said,

and their ancestors haven’t kept to themselves,

19people the land was given to

and no foreigners passed through—

20the sinful writhe in pain their whole life;

the ruthless have a limited number of years.

21They hear terrifying sounds coming;

while they’re at peace, destroyers attack them.

22They don’t expect to come back from darkness;

they feel destined for the sword.

23They wander around asking for food;

they know darkness is on its way.	Job 15:17-23

24Distress and anguish terrify them

like a king preparing for battle,

25because they shake their fists at God

and defy the Almighty.

26They attack him with abandon,

with reinforced shields.

27They’re stout in face and thigh,

28but they’ll live in desolate towns,

in houses nobody wants to occupy,

homes destined for demolition.

29They won’t get rich, their wealth won’t last;

their grain won’t be so heavy it bends over.

30They won’t escape from darkness;

the hot sun will wither their roots;

the wind will blow away their blossoms.	Job 15:24-30

31They shouldn’t trust in emptiness and deceive themselves;

emptiness will be their payback.

32It will be paid in full before their time;

their palm fronds won’t turn green again.

33Their unripe grapes will fall from the vine;

their olive trees will lose their blossoms.

34The godless live in barren company;

fire consumes the tents of those who bribe.

35They conceive schemes and give birth to evil;

their mind prepares deceit.”	Job 15:31-35

16:1Job answered:

2“I’ve heard a lot of things like that;

you’re miserable comforters.

3Is there no end to windy words?

What’s your problem that you answer me like that?

4I could talk to you like you’re talking if I was in your place.

I could string out words and shake my head at you.

5Or, I could encourage you

so my comfort could lessen your pain.	Job 16:1-5

6“If I speak, it doesn’t take away my pain;

if I don’t speak, how much of it goes away?

7God has worn me out;

he’s taken away my family.

8He has made me skin and bones

and used it as a witness against me.

My haggard body shows in my gaunt face.

9His anger hunts me down and tears me up;

he gnashes his teeth at me;

my adversary glares at me.

10People gape at me with their mouth

and slap me on the cheek in their contempt;

they gang up on me.	 	Job 16:6-10

11God has handed me over to ungodly people

and thrown me away to sinners.

12I was at ease, but he tore me apart;

he grabbed me by the neck and dashed me to pieces.

13His arrows have pierced me all over;

he’s slashed open my kidneys without mercy

and poured out my gall on the ground.

14He’s broken me down time after time

and charged at me like a soldier.

15I sewed burlap on my skin

and laid my strength in the dust.

16My face is flushed from crying;

I have dark circles around my eyes

17although I haven’t been violent,

and my prayer is pure.	Job 16:11-17

18“Earth, don’t cover up my blood;

don’t let my outcry cease.

19Even now my witness is in heaven;

my Advocate is on high.

20My friends make fun of me;

I shed my tears to God.

21Oh that I could plead with him

like a person does with his friend!

22In a few years, I’ll go the way of no return.

17:1My spirit’s broken; my days are snuffed out;

people have already dug my grave.

2Mockers sit around

and taunt me to my face.		Job 16:18-17:2

3“God, sign a pledge for me;

who else will put up security for me?

4You’ve kept them from understanding;

so don’t let them triumph.

5They inform against their friends

to get a share of their property;

so let their children pass out from hunger.	Job 17:3-5

6“God has made me a byword among people;

I’m someone they spit at.

7My sight is blurry from grieving;

my neighbors look like shadows.

8Godly people are appalled at such a thing;

innocent people oppose the godless.

9The righteous hold onto their way;

the ones with clean hands grow stronger. 	Job 17:6-9

10“All of you, if you come again,

I still won’t find a wise man among you.

11My days are done;

my hopes are dashed;

my heart’s desires are gone.

12You friends claim night is day and say,

‘Light amounts to darkness.’

13If I look for the grave to be my house

and spread my couch in the darkness,

14if I say to the pit, ‘My mother,’

or ‘My sister,’

15where’s my hope?

Who even cares about my hope?

16It’ll go down to Sheol with me;

we’ll go down in the ground together.”	Job 17:10-16

18:1Bildad the Shuhite answered:

2“How long will you stumble around for words?

Make some sense so we can talk.

3Why do you treat us like animals?

You think we’re stupid?

4Are you going to tear yourself to pieces in your anger?

Are we supposed to leave the world for fear of you?

Should ledge rocks quake out of place?

5“The light of the wicked goes out;

their flame stops giving light.

6Their tent is dark inside;

the lamp above them has gone out.

7Their long strides have shortened;

their schemes have tripped them up.		Job 18:1-7

8They get caught in a net by their feet

when they step on its mesh.

9A trap seizes them by the heel;

a snare snaps shut on them.

10A noose for them is hidden on the ground;

a trap lies on their path.

11Panic all around terrifies them

and nips at their heels.

12Their strength is famished;

disaster is ready to knock them down.

13Disease eats away at their skin;

their rigid limbs are the first signs of death.

14They’re torn from their secure tent

and taken to the king of terrors.

15Nothing of theirs stays in their tent;

sulfur rains on their houses.	Job 18:8-15

16Their roots have dried up below;

their branches break off above.

17The memory of them fades from the land;

they don’t have a name people keep in mind.

18They’ve been driven from light into darkness

and chased out of the world.

19They don’t have any offspring among their people,

no survivors where they used to live.

20People to the west are appalled at their fate;

those to the east are gripped with horror.

21Surely that’s the kind of house ungodly people have;

such is the place of those who don’t know God.”	Job 18:16-21

19:1Job answered:

2“How long are you going to torment me

and shatter me with a barrage of words?

3You’ve insulted me ten times over;

aren’t you ashamed of treating me wrong?

4Even if I did make mistakes,

that’s on me.

5If you’re acting superior to me

and using my humiliation to argue against me,

6know that God is the One that’s put me in the wrong

and closed his net around me.	Job 19:1-6

7“I cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I don’t get an answer;

I call for help, but justice doesn’t come.

8He has blocked my way so I can’t go on;

he’s darkened my path.

9He has stripped me of my honor

and taken off my crown.

10He has destroyed me on every side; I’m finished;

he’s uprooted my hope like a tree.

11He has flashed his anger at me

and considered me his enemy.

12His troops have come at me in force;

they’ve camped around my tent

and thrown siege works up against me.	Job 19:7-12

13“He has taken my brothers away from me;

my acquaintances are alienated.

14My relatives are gone;

my friends have forgotten me.

15The ones who live in my house

consider me a stranger;

I’m a foreigner to my maids.

16When I call to my servant, he doesn’t answer me;

I have to beg him.

17My breath is repulsive to my wife;

my own brothers detest me.

18Even kids despise me

and contradict me when I stand up.

19My associates abhor me;

the ones I love have turned against me.	Job 19:13-19

20I’m skin and bones;

my skin is sloughing off;

my teeth are coming loose.

21Show me some mercy, friends;

God’s hand has struck me.

22Do you have to harass me like he does?

Haven’t you chewed on me enough?	Job 19:20-22

23“Oh that my words were written down,

inscribed in a scroll!

24Oh that they were engraved permanently on a rock

with an iron chisel and inlaid with lead!

25I know my Redeemer’s alive,

and in the end he’ll stand on the earth.

26Even after my skin decays,

without my body I’ll see God.

27I’ll see him myself;

the thought of that overwhelms me.

28If you say, ‘Can we find a way to harass him?’

What pretext can we use for a case against him?’

29fear the sword

because wrath punishes with a sword;

you’ll find out there’s a judgment!”	Job 19:23-29

20:1Zophar the Naamathite answered:

2“My thoughts make me answer

because I’m in turmoil inside.

3I’ve listened to your insults,

and I’m answering from what I understand.

4Don’t you know from of old—

from the time God put people on earth—

5that the triumph of sinners is short-lived;

the joy of the godless is temporary.	Job 20:1-5

6Though they’re as tall as the sky,

though their heads are in the clouds,

7they’ll perish forever like their own feces;

people that saw them before will say, ‘Where’d they go?’

8They’ll fly away like a dream,

and nobody will find them;

they’ll vanish like a nightmare.

9People that saw them before won’t see them again;

their family won’t have them around anymore.

10Their offspring will have to give back

the wealth they’d confiscated

and beg from the poor

11They may have youthful health,

but it’ll lie down with them in the dust.	Job 20:6-11

12“Though evil is sweet in their mouth

and they hide it under their tongue,

13though they like the taste of it

and won’t spit it out,

14yet the food in their stomach will ferment

into the venom of asps.

15Though they swallow wealth, they’ll vomit it up;

God will purge it from their stomach.

16They’ll suck the poison of asps;

the viper’s tongue will slay them.

17They won’t admire the streams

that flow with honey and curds.

18They’ll lose everything they worked for and couldn’t swallow;

they won’t even enjoy the profits from their trading,

19because they’ve oppressed the poor

and seized houses they didn’t build.	Job 20:12-19

20“Since their greed is never satisfied,

they won’t keep anything they enjoy.

21There won’t be anything left for them to devour;

their prosperity won’t last.

22They’ll have so much stuff they can’t move;

the full force of their misery will stack up against them.

23While they’re filling their stomach,

God will be sending his fierce anger at them

and raining it on them.

24They may escape an iron weapon

only to have a bronze arrow point run them through.

25It’s thrust will come out of their back;

the glittering point will puncture their gall;

death-terrors will descend on them.	Job 20:20-25

26Their treasures are destined for total darkness;

unfanned flames will consume them;

whatever’s left in their tent will burn up.

27Sky will reveal their sin;

earth will condemn them.

28Others will carry off what’s in their house

at the time when God demonstrates his anger.

29That’s sinful people’s plight,

the inheritance God decrees for them.”	Job 20:26-29

21:1Job answered:

2“Listen carefully;

let this be your consolation.

3Bear with me;

after I’ve spoken, you can mock me.

4Am I just complaining about people?

Why shouldn’t I be impatient?

5Be appalled at the way I look;

put your hand over your mouth in shock.

6When I think about it,

I get scared and shaky.

7Why do bad people keep on living

and become so powerful?	Job 21:1-7

8Their descendants are secure in their presence;

their offspring are near them.

9They have safe houses,

and God’s not beating them with a rod.

10Their bulls breed without fail,

and their cows don’t miscarry.

11They let out their little ones like a flock

to skip around and play.

12They sing to the accompaniment of tambourines and harps

and celebrate with a flute.

13They’re prosperous their whole life

and go down to Sheol in peace.

14They tell God, ‘Get away!

We don’t want you telling us what to do.’

15‘Who is the Almighty that we should serve him anyway?’

‘What good would it do to pray?’

16They think they produce their own prosperity;

I won’t have anything to do with such thinking.	Job 21:8-16

17“Yet how often do sinful people’s lamps get put out,

does calamity fall on them,

does God measure out destruction in his anger,

18and they’re like straw in the wind,

like chaff in a storm?

19You say, ‘Well, God stores up their sins for their children.’

Let him pay it back to the parents so they know it’s happening.

20Let them experience their own destruction

and drink the Almighty’s wrath themselves.	Job 21:17-20

21What do they care about their families after they die,

when they can’t talk anymore?

22Can anybody teach God anything

since he judges even the most powerful?

23They die in full strength,

completely at ease and satisfied.

24Their bodies are healthy;

their bone marrow is moist,

25while others die in bitterness

without tasting anything good.

26They all lie down in the ground the same way

with maggots all over them.			Job 21:21-26

27“I know what you’re thinking about:

schemes for doing me wrong.

28You say, ‘Where’s the nobleman’s house?

Where are the tents sinners live in?’

29Haven’t you asked travelers?

Don’t you believe what they tell you?	Job 21:27-29

30Sinners are reserved for disaster,

to be led out into the fury when it comes.

31Who confronts them openly about their sins?

Who repays them for what they do?

32When they’re carried to their graves,

an honor guard keeps watch over their tombs.

33The soil in the valley gives them sweet repose;

a countless throng precedes and follows them,

paying their respects.

34Do you think you can comfort me with clichés?

Your explanations don’t make any sense.”	Job 21:30-34

22:1Eliphaz the Temanite answered.

2“What benefit can a mortal be to God?

Aren’t even the wise only useful to themselves?

3Is the Almighty delighted if you’re good?

What good is it to him if you’re perfect?

4Surely it’s not because you revere him that he’s reproving you,

that he’s bringing judgment against you.

5Isn’t it more likely that you’re sinful,

that your sins are endless?

6Maybe you’ve exacted pledges from your friends

and stripped off their clothes as security.

7Maybe you’ve withheld water from the fainting

and food from the hungry.

8Maybe you think the land belongs to the powerful,

that only you honorable types have a right to live in it.

9Maybe you’ve sent widows away with nothing

and crushed the fatherless.

10So, there are traps everywhere around you,

and panic overwhelms you.

11Your light’s so dim you can’t see,

and a flood is surging over you.	Job 22:1-11

12“Isn’t God high in the sky,

higher than the stars?

13But you say, ‘So how can he see what I’m doing?

Can he judge through such darkness?

14Dark clouds wrap around him so he can’t see;

he walks on the vaulted sky.’

15Will you stay on the ancient way

that sinful people have walked,

16people snatched away before their time,

whose foundations a river washed away?

17They tell God, ‘Get away!’

‘What good is the Almighty to us?’

18Yet he’s filled their houses with good things—

(but I stay away from sinners’ counsel).

19Good people are glad to see the wicked get destroyed;

the innocent laugh and say,

20‘Our adversaries are destroyed;

fire has consumed their wealth.’	Job 22:12-20

21“Submit to God; make peace with him,

and good things will happen to you.

22Accept his instruction;

take his words to heart.

23If you come back to the Almighty, he’ll restore you;

if you remove sinfulness far from your home,

24if you throw your gold in the dust,

the gold of Ophir among the stones in the wadis,

25then the Almighty will be your gold;

he’ll become your choice silver.

26Then you’ll delight in the Almighty

and look up at God.

27You’ll pray to him, and he’ll hear you;

and you’ll keep your vows.

28When you decide something, it’ll happen;

light will shine on your path.

29When people put you down, you’ll still be confident

because he saves the humble.

30He delivers innocent people;

so you’ll be delivered because you have clean hands.”

Job 22:21-30

23:1Job answered:

2“My complaint is still bitter;

God’s hand weighs heavily on me despite my groaning.

3If only I knew where to find him

so I could go to his courtroom!

4I’d present my case

and offer my arguments.

5I’d find out what he’d answer

and understand what he’d say.

6Would he oppose me with his great power?

No, he’d listen!

7Someone godly would be reasoning with him,

and my Judge would acquit me permanently.	Job 23:1-7

8“I go east, but he’s not there;

I go west, but I can’t find him.

9When he acts in the north, I can’t see it;

when he turns to the south, he’s hidden there too.

10But he knows where I’m going;

when he tests me, I’ll come out like pure gold.

11I’ve stayed close to his steps

and kept to his ways without turning aside.

12I haven’t veered off from his commands;

I’ve treasured up what he says more than food.

13But once he’s made up his mind, who can change it?

He’ll go ahead and do to me what he wants.

14He’ll fulfill his plans;

he has intentions for my whole destiny.

15So I’m intimidated by him;

when I think about all this, it scares me.

16It’s God that’s made my heart faint,

the Almighty that’s terrified me.

17Yet the darkness doesn’t silence me

or the deep gloom that covers me.	Job 23:8-17

24:1“Why doesn’t the Almighty maintain

a regular court schedule for judging?

Why do those who know him wait for him in vain?

2Some remove landmarks,

seize flocks and eat them,

3drive away donkeys that belong to the fatherless,

take widows’ oxen for pledges.

4They run the needy off the road;

the poor people have to hide from them.

5Like wild donkeys in the desert,

the poor labor at foraging for food,

looking for prey in the wild to feed their children.

6They gather fodder in the field

and glean sinners’ vineyards.

7They spend the night without enough clothes

to protect them against the cold.

8They’re soaked from mountain rain

and huddle in the rocks for lack of shelter.	Job 24:1-8

9“Others snatch the fatherless from the breast

and take pledges against the poor.

10They make the naked go without clothes

and take away sheaves from the hungry.

11They press out oil between the olive rows

and tread winepresses for others, yet suffer thirst.

12From the city, the people groan,

the wounded cry out for help,

but God ignores their prayers.	Job 24:9-12

13“Others rebel against the light;

they refuse to know its ways or stay on them.

14A murderer gets up at dawn

to kill the poor and needy;

at night he’s a thief.

15An adulterer waits for twilight and says,

‘Nobody will see me’;

he disguises himself.

16In the dark they break into houses

and sleep in the daytime;

they’re not accustomed to light.

17Morning is the same to them as dense darkness;

they’re allies with the terrors of deep gloom.	Job 24:13-17

18“But they’re swiftly carried away like foam on a creek;

their land is cursed;

they’re afraid to go into their own vineyards.

19Sheol consumes sinners

like drought and heat consume snow.

20Their mothers forget about them,

maggots feed on them till they’re not remembered;

they’re blown over like trees in a windstorm.

21They prey on barren and childless women

and fail to help needy widows.

22But God uses his power to drag away the rich;

they may get established,

but they have no guarantee of life

23He may let them live in security,

but he keeps an eye on their progress in life.

24They’re honored for a little while; then they’re gone;

they’re brought low and fade away like everything else,

cut off like heads of grain.

25If that’s not so, who can prove me wrong

and make my speech pointless?”	Job 24:18-25

25:1Bildad the Shuhite answered:

2“Dominion and awe belong to God,

who establishes order high in his sky.

3Who can count his troops?

Who doesn’t his light rise on?

4How can anyone be innocent in his presence?

How can anyone born of woman be pure?

5If the moon isn’t bright

and the stars aren’t pure to God,

6how much less people—like maggots,

and their offspring—mere worms.”	Job 25:1-6

26:1Job answered:

2“What a help you are to the weak!

How you’ve saved arms with no strength!

3What counsel you’ve given me in my stupidity!

What brilliant insight you’ve provided!

4Who’ve you been talking to?

Whose spirit has been speaking through you?!	Job 26:1-4

5“The departed spirits tremble

below the water and its inhabitants.

6Sheol is naked in front of him;

Abaddon has no covering before him.

7He stretches out the north over empty space

and hangs the earth on nothing.

8He wraps up water in his clouds,

and they don’t burst under its weight.

9He shrouds the full moon in clouds.

10He has set the horizon between the water above and below

and put a boundary between light and darkness.

11The mountains, pillars of the sky, tremble

and shudder at his rebuke.

12He calms the sea monster with his power

and breaks Rahab in pieces with his intelligence.

13He clears clouds from the sky with his breath

and wounds the celestial fleeing Serpent with his hand.

14These are just fringes of what he does:

his faint whisper!

his loud thunder!

Who can comprehend his power?”	Job 26:5-14

27:1Job continued his comments:

2“As God lives, who has taken away my rights,

the Almighty, who has made me bitter,

3as long as I’m alive and God’s breath is in me,

4I won’t speak wickedness or lie.

5I’ll never concede that you’re right;

I’ll defend my integrity till I die.

6I’ll hold onto my claim about my goodness,

and my conscience won’t accuse me for it.	Job 27:1-6

7“May my enemies be like the wicked;

may my attackers be like the sinful.

8What hope do the godless have when God cuts them off,

when he takes their life away?

9Will he listen to their outcry

when they get in trouble?

10Will they be able to delight in the Almighty

and call on him at any time?

11Let me teach you about God’s power;

I won’t conceal anything about the Almighty.

12You’ve all seen that;

so why are you saying such foolish things to me? Job 27:7-12

13“This is sinful people’s lot from God,

the fate tyrants receive from the Almighty:

14their many sons he destines for the sword;

their descendants won’t have enough to eat;

15disease buries the ones that outlive them;

their widows won’t feel like crying.

16Though sinners pile up silver like dust

and make clothes as plentiful as clay,

17the good are the ones that will wear them;

the innocent will divide up their silver.

18The house they build is as fragile as a spider’s web

or a watchman’s hut.

19They go to bed rich, but only once;

when they open their eyes, their wealth is gone.

20Panic overwhelms them like a flood;

a tornado carries them off at night.

21The east wind picks them up

and sweeps them away;

22it whirls around them without sparing

though they try to escape its power.

23People will clap their hands and jeer at them.	Job 27:13-23

28:1“There’s a mine for silver

and a refinery for gold.

2Iron comes out of the ground,

and people can smelt copper.

3They use a torch in the darkness

and go in as far they can,

searching for the ore in gloom and deep shadow.

4They sink mine shafts far from where people live

and go down them, dangling on ropes,

swinging back and forth.

5People grow food on top of the ground;

but far below, the ground melts as if by fire.	Job 28:1-5

6Its rocks yield lapis lazuli,

whose flecks glitter like gold.

7Birds of prey can’t get to it;

no falcon has seen it.

8Proud animals don’t set foot in it;

fierce lions don’t prowl there.

9Miners find flint

and tear down mountains to get at it.

10They chisel out tunnels in the rock

to discover precious stones.

11They dam up trickling streams

and bring hidden treasure out to light.	Job 28:6-11

12“But where can people discover wisdom?

Where is intelligence located?

13People don’t know what it’s worth;

they can’t find it where people live.

14The deep says, ‘It’s not here’;

the sea says, ‘It’s not inside me.’

15Pure gold doesn’t exchange for it;

silver doesn’t weigh out equal to its price.

16Its value can’t be calculated in the gold from Ophir,

in precious onyx or lapis lazuli.	Job 28:12-16

17Gold or crystal can’t match it;

it can’t be traded for articles made from fine gold.

18Coral and crystal can’t be mentioned with it;

acquiring wisdom is more important than buying pearls.

19The topaz in Nubia can’t compare to it;

it can’t be measured in terms of pure gold.

20Where then does wisdom come from?

Where’s it located?

21Nothing alive can see it;

it’s hid from the birds in the sky.

22Abaddon and Death say,

‘We haven’t heard any report about it.’	Job 28:17-22

23“God knows where it is

and understands how to get to it.

24He can see all the way to the end of the earth

and everything that’s under the sky.

25When he decided how hard the wind should blow

and how much rain should fall,

26when he decreed the way rain should form

and the course a thunderbolt should follow,

27then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;

he put it in place and tested it.

28He told humanity, ‘Respecting the Lord shows wisdom;

getting away from sin brings insight.’”	Job 28:23-28

29:1Job took up his discourse again:

2“Oh that I could be like I was just a few months ago

when God was watching over me,

3when his lamp shined above my head

and I walked through darkness by his light,

4while I was in the prime of life

and his friendship hovered above my tent,

5when the Almighty was still with me

and my children were around me,

6when my feet were drenched with cream

and the millstone poured out streams of olive oil for me!

7when I went to the city gate

and took my seat in the town square.	Job 29:1-7

8Young men saw me and stepped aside,

old men stood up,

9officials stopped talking

and put their hands over their mouths;

10nobles’ voices got quiet

and put their tongues against their palates.

11When people heard me, they praised me;

when they saw me, they spoke well of me

12because I helped the poor that asked for it

and the orphan that had no advocate.

13People about to die blessed me;

I made widows sing for joy.

14I dressed in goodness;

justice covered me like a robe and turban.	Job 29:8-14

15I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.

16I became a father to the needy

and helped strangers I didn’t know.

17I broke the jaws of the wicked

and snatched the prey from their teeth.

18Then I supposed, ‘I’ll die in my nest

and multiply my days like sand.

19My roots reach out to the water;

dew lies all night on my branches.

20My honor is always fresh;

my bow stays new in my hand.’	Job 29:15-20

21“They listened to me, waited,

and kept quiet to hear my advice.

22When I spoke, they had nothing to add;

what I said was sufficient for them.

23They waited for me like spring rain

and drank in my words like fresh showers.

24I smiled at them when they weren’t sure what to do;

they valued my approval.

25I told them what course of action to take

and sat as their chief;

I lived like a king among his troops,

like somebody that comforted mourners.	Job 29:21-25

30:1“But now people younger than me make fun of me,

people whose fathers I wouldn’t let

run with my sheep dogs.

2What good was their strength to me,

fellows whose vigor was gone?

3They were haggard from hunger and want

and clawed the dry ground in the wastelands.

4They picked wild greens from among the bushes

and ate the roots of broom shrubs.

5People drove them away;

they shouted at them like they were thieves.

6So they lived in ravines, caves, and rocks;

7they sounded like animals in the bushes

and huddled together under the nettles.

8A senseless, unnamed bunch,

they were outcasts from society.	Job 30:1-8

9“Now their sons mock me with songs

and use my name as a byword.

10They’re appalled at me and shrink back;

they don’t hesitate to spit in my face.

11Because God has removed my bowstring and cast me down,

people don’t hesitate to argue with me.

12This rabble opposes me,

drives me out, lays traps for me.

13They tear up my road and profit from my misfortune;

nobody restrains them.

14They come at me as if through a wide breach;

they roll in like a storm.

15They terrorize me

and chase my honor like the wind;

my prosperity dissipates like a cloud.	Job 30:9-15

16“My life ebbs out of me;

depression has taken hold of me.

17At night my bones ache,

and soreness gnaws at me.

18My clothes are tattered from violence;

they hang on me like a coat.	Job 30:16-18

19“You’ve thrown me in the mud;

you’ve made me like dust and ashes.

20I call out to you, but you don’t answer;

I stand up, but you turn your attention elsewhere.

21You’ve become cruel

and use your power to persecute.

22You pick me up and blow me around in the wind;

you destroy me in the storm.

23I know you’re going to bring me to death,

the destiny of all the living. 			Job 30:19-23

24“Don’t people in a pile of ruins hold out their hands

and in their misery call out for help?

25Haven’t I cried for people whose life is hard?

Wasn’t I grieved for the needy?

26When I expected good, evil came;

when I needed light, darkness arrived.

27I’m in turmoil inside; I can’t relax;

days of misery lie ahead of me.

28I go around mourning without comfort;

I stand up in the assembly and call out for help.

29I’ve become a brother to jackals,

a companion of owls.

30My skin is ashen,

and I’m burning up with fever.

31My harp plays music for mourning;

my flute moans with those who weep.	Job 30:24-31

31:1“I’ve made a covenant with my eyes

not to look with lust at a young woman?

2What is our portion from God above,

our inheritance from the Almighty on high?

3Isn’t it misfortune for the unjust,

disaster for sinners?

4Doesn’t he see everything I do

and count every step I take?

5“If I’ve supposedly conducted myself falsely

and tried to deceive,

6let him weigh me with accurate scales

and he’ll find out my integrity.

7If I’ve strayed off the road,

if my heart has lusted for what my eyes have seen,

if any other blemish has stuck to me,

8let somebody else eat what I sow;

let them uproot my crops.	Job 31:1-8

9“If a woman enticed me,

if I’ve lurked at my neighbor’s doorway,

10may my wife grind for somebody else,

and let others sleep with her.

11That would be shameful,

a crime judges would punish.

12a fire that would consume all the way to Abaddon

and completely burn up everything I own.	Job 31:9-12

13“If I’ve denied claim by my male or female servants,

complaints they filed against me,

14how could I face God?

What could I say when he questioned me?

15Didn’t the One that made me in the womb make the accuser too?

Didn’t the same One make us both?	Job 31:13-15

16“If I’ve withheld from the poor what they needed

or stifled widows’ hopes,

17if I’ve eaten my morsel alone

and a fatherless child hadn’t shared it

(18from my youth I reared him like a father,

and from infancy I guided her),

19if I’ve seen anybody perish for lack of clothing

or the needy go without clothes,

20if their loins haven’t thanked me

and been warmed with wool from my sheep,

21if I’ve mistreated the fatherless

because I knew the courts would support me—

22pull my shoulder out of its socket

and break off my arm at the elbow,

23because calamity from God scares me,

because I can’t resist his majesty. 		Job 31:16-23

24“If I’ve put confidence in gold

and called fine gold my trust,

25if I’ve gloated because I was wealthy

and had secured so much,

26if I’ve looked at the shining sun

or the moon moving in splendor,

27and became secretly enticed

and threw it a kiss—

28that too would’ve been a sin the judges punish,

because I’d have been disloyal to God above. Job 31:24-28

29“Have I celebrated my enemy’s ruin

or been happy when disaster fell on him?

30No, I haven’t let my mouth sin

by asking for his life in a curse.

31“Haven’t the ones in my tent said

there’s no one he’s let go hungry?

32No foreigner has had to lodge outside;

I’ve opened my doors to travelers. 	Job 31:29-32

33“Have I covered up my sins like people do

by hiding my iniquity in my heart,

34because I was afraid of the big crowd

and the contempt of families terrified me,

so I kept quiet and didn’t go outside?

35Oh that somebody would listen!

Here’s my signature on my defense;

let the Almighty answer me!

Oh that my adversary would write out my indictment;

36I’d carry it openly on my shoulder

or wear it proudly like a crown.

37I’d declare to God every step I’d taken

and approach him confidently like a prince.	Job 31:33-37

38“If my land cries out against me

and my furrows are all wet with tears,

39if I’ve eaten more than my share of the crops

or broken the spirit of its tenants—

40let briars grow on my land instead of wheat,

stinkweeds in place of barley.”

Job’s words end here.	Job 31:38-40

32:1The three men stopped replying to Job, because he was certain he was innocent. 2Then Elihu Ben-Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram, was mad at Job because he’d justified himself to God. 3He was mad at his three friends because they couldn’t answer Job but still condemned him. 4Elihu had waited to speak because they were years older than he was. 5When he saw they didn’t provide an answer, his anger burned inside him. 6So he spoke up.

“I’m young and you’re old;

so I’ve been reluctant to tell you what I believed.

7I thought age should speak

because wisdom should come with age.

8But it’s the spirit in a person

and the breath of the Almighty that give insight.

9Abundant years may not bring wisdom;

elders may not understand what’s just.

10So listen and I’ll say what I think too.		Job 32:1-10

11“I waited for your words;

I listened to your reasoning

while you thought about what to say.

12I paid careful attention;

none of you refuted Job

or answered his arguments.

13Don’t say, ‘We’ve found him too wise for us;

God alone will have to refute him, not mortals.’

14Job hasn’t been arguing with me;

but I wouldn’t have answered him with your arguments.

Job 32:11-14

15“You’re discredited;

you don’t have anything else to say.

16Should I keep waiting

when you’re not speaking anymore?

17I’ll give my answer too

and express my opinion.

18I have so many things I want to say;

my spirit constrains me to speak.

19My stomach is like an unvented wine cask;

it’s about to burst like a new wineskin.

20I have to say something so I can get relief;

let me answer.

21I won’t show partiality to anybody

or flatter anyone.

22I don’t know how to flatter;

otherwise, my Maker would put an end to me.” 	Job 32:15-22

33:1“But now, Job, listen to what I have to say;

hear me out.

2I’m opening my mouth now;

the tongue in my mouth is speaking.

3What I’m saying expresses my uprightness;

my lips declare knowledge sincerely.

4The Spirit of God has made me;

the breath of the Almighty gives me breath.

5Answer me if you can;

state your case; take your stand.

6I belong to God like you do;

I’ve been formed out of clay too.

7I shouldn’t be a threat you;

I won’t come down hard on you.	Job 33:1-7

8“You’ve spoken where I could hear you;

I’ve heard what you said:

9‘I’m pure, without sin,

innocent, not guilty of anything.

10He invents pretexts against me

and considers me his enemy.

11He puts my feet in stocks

and watches my paths.’	Job 33:8-11

12“Let me tell you, you’re not right in this,

because God is greater than you are.

13Why do you complain

that he won’t account for everything he does?

14God speaks in one way, maybe two;

though people don’t notice it—

15in a dream, in a vision at night,

when people are sound asleep in bed.

16Then he opens their ears and warns them,

17so he can turn them aside from doing wrong

and keep them from their pride.

18He holds them back from the Pit

and their lives from death by the sword.		Job 33:12-18

19“God disciplines people with pain on their beds,

with constant aching in their bones;

20so they lose their appetites

and even their favorite food disgusts them.

21Their bodies waste away,

and their bones show.

22Then they draw near the Pit;

they come close to the angels that bring death.	Job 33:19-22

23“If there’s an angel to mediate for some people—

one out of a thousand—

to say what’s right about them,

24then let him be gracious to them and say,

‘Deliver them from the Pit;

I’ve found a ransom for these lives.’

25Let their bodies become fresh with youth

and return to their youthful vigor.

26Then they’ll pray to God, and he’ll accept them

so they can see his face with joy

and restore their good standing.

27They’ll sing to other people and say,

‘I sinned and perverted what’s right,

but he didn’t hold it against me.

28He’s rescued me from the Pit,

and I’ll see the light.’	Job 33:23-28

29“God does these things more than once for people;

30he brings them back from the Pit

so they can see the light of life.

31Pay attention, Job; listen;

keep quiet and let me talk.

32Then if you have anything to say, you can answer me,

because I want to see you justified.

33If not, listen, and I’ll teach you wisdom.”		Job 33:29-33

34:1Elihu continued:

2“Listen, you wise men;

pay attention, you that ‘know’;

3the ear tests words

like the palate tastes food.

4Let’s choose what’s right;

let’s determine for ourselves what’s good;

5because Job has said, ‘I’m good,

but God has disregarded my goodness.

6Should I lie about my goodness?

I have a wound that won’t heal,

but I haven’t done anything wrong.’

7Who is like Job

that drinks scorn like water,

8that pals around with sinners,

that associates with bad people—

9because he said, ‘What good does it do

to try to please God’?				Job 34:1-9

10“So, listen, you that ‘understand.’

God would not sin;

the Almighty would never do what’s wrong.

11He pays everyone according to what they’ve done

and treats them the way their living deserves.

12God doesn’t act wickedly;

the Almighty won’t pervert justice.

13Who gave him authority over the earth?

Who laid the whole world on him?

14If he’d take back his spirit,

if he’d gather his breath to himself,

15everybody would die;

mortals would return to dust.	Job 34:10-15

16“But if you understand,

listen to what I’m saying.

17Would God be ruling if he hated justice?

Will you condemn someone great that’s good,

18who tells kings, ‘You’re worthless,’

or nobles, ‘You’re corrupt,’

19who doesn’t show deference to officials

or care more about the rich than the poor?

They’re all God’s work.

20They die quickly;

at midnight they shudder and pass away;

the powerful are taken away without human hand. Job 34:16-20

21“He watches what people do;

he sees their every step.

22There’s no darkness or deep shadow

where sinners can hide.

23He doesn’t have to investigate anyone

and bring them in to find out what they’ve done.

24He brings the mighty to ruin without an investigation

and replaces them with others.

25He knows what they’ve done;

he overthrows them at night and destroys them.	Job 34:21-25

26He strikes them down openly for their sinfulness

27because they’ve turned aside from following him

and don’t care about his ways;

28they’ve made the poor cry out to him,

so he hears the call of the oppressed—

29if he does keep quiet, who can condemn him?

when he hides, who can see him,

whether individual or nation?—

30so the godless won’t rule

or become a snare to other people.	Job 34:26-30

31“Has anybody told God,

‘I’ve been disciplined; I won’t offend anymore’;

32or, ‘Show me what I didn’t notice;

if I’ve sinned, I won’t do it again’?

33Will God punish in a way that suits you

when you’re the one that rejected him?

You have to make the choice, not me;

say what you know.

34People with insight say to me—

the wise, who listen to me—

35‘Job doesn’t know what he’s talking about;

his words don’t make sense.

36He deserves the maximum penalty

because of the sinful way he answers.

37He’s adding rebellion to his sins;

he scornfully claps his hands at us

and multiplies his words against God.’”	Job 34:31-37

35:1Elihu continued:

2“Do you think it’s righteous

for you to say you’re upright before God?

3You say, ‘What advantage will I have?

What benefit will I get more than if I’d sinned?’

4I’ll answer you and your friends.

5Look at the sky;

the clouds are higher than you are.

6If you’ve sinned, what do you gain against God?

if you have lots of sins, what harm are you doing to him?

7If you’re good, what good are you doing for him?

What good does he get out of you?

8Your goodness is for other people like you.	Job 35:1-8

9“They cry out because they’re oppressed;

they call for help against powerful people.

10But nobody says, ‘Where’s God my Maker,

who gives songs at night,

11who teaches us more than the animals on the ground

and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?’

12There bad people call out, but he doesn’t answer

because they’re arrogant.

13Indeed, God will ignore empty cries;

the Almighty doesn’t pay any attention to them.

14How much less when you say you don’t see him;

he has your case,

but you’re having to wait for him to give notice!

15Now, since he hasn’t visited in his anger

and acknowledged sin enough,

16you open your mouth with empty talk, Job,

not knowing what you’re talking about.” 	Job 35:9-16

36:1Elihu continued:

2“Bear with me a little longer, and I’ll show you

what I have to say on God’s behalf.

3I’ll bring my knowledge from afar

and credit goodness to my Maker.

4What I’m saying is true;

I know perfectly well what I’m talking about.

5God is powerful, but he doesn’t despise anybody;

he’s mighty in his power to understand.

6He doesn’t keep sinners alive,

but gives justice to the oppressed.

7He doesn’t take his eyes off of good people,

but enthrones them with kings

and exalts them permanently.

8If they’re bound in chains

and held tight in a web of difficulties,

9he tells them the reason:

it’s because they’ve acted arrogantly.

10He opens their ears to instruction

and commands them to turn away from sin. 	Job 36:1-10

11If they listen and serve him,

they’ll end their days in prosperity,

their years in pleasantness.

12But if they ignore him,

they’ll perish by the sword and die ignorant.

13But the godless in heart store up anger;

they don’t call out for help when he restrains them.

14They die young;

their life perishes among the cult prostitutes.

15He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions

and opens their ears with adversity. 		Job 36:11-15

16So he’s luring you with distress

into a safe space that’s not crowded

and has set delicious food on your table.

17“But you’ve become obsessed with condemning sinners,

obsessed with judgment and justice.

18Be careful that anger doesn’t lure you into scoffing;

don’t let the great cost of the ransom turn you aside.

19Will your wealth or strength

keep you away from troubles?

20Don’t long for the cover of night

when people disappear unnoticed.

21Make sure not to turn to evil,

which you’ve preferred to affliction.

22God is honored by his power;

who can teach like him?

23Who has prescribed his conduct

or said, ‘You’ve done something wrong’?	Job 36:16-23

24“Remember to extol his work

that people sing about.

25Everybody has seen it;

they can look at it from a long way off.

26God is so great we don’t understand him;

we can’t find out how old he is.

27He evaporates water drops

and distills his mist into rain,

28which the clouds

pour down on people abundantly.	Job 36:24-28

29Can anyone understand how clouds spread out

or how thunder claps in his pavilion?

30He spreads out lightning all around him

and covers the depths of the ocean.

31They’re how he governs nations

and supplies food abundantly.

32He fills his hands with lightning bolts

and hurls them at their marks.

33Thunder announces his presence

and warns livestock that a storm is coming.	Job 36:29-33

37:1“My heart pounds when I think about this;

it feels like it’s out of place.

2Listen closely to his thundering,

the rumbling that comes from his mouth.

3He unleashes his lightning under the whole sky;

it travels to the horizon in every direction.

4After it his roars;

he thunders with his majestic voice

and doesn’t hold anything back.

5God thunders wondrously

and does extraordinary things we can’t comprehend.

6He tells the snow to fall on the ground

and the rain to be heavy.

7He stops everyone’s labor

so they can watch his work.	Job 37:1-7

8Animals head for their dens

and stay in their lairs.

9The stormy wind comes from its rooms,

and the driving winds bring the cold.

10God’s breath makes ice,

and the wide expanse of water freezes.

11He loads up dark clouds with moisture;

they disperse his lightning flashes.

12They change direction by his guidance;

they do whatever he commands across the world.

13He makes these things happen either to punish his people

or to water the earth and show his love.	Job 37:8-13

14“Listen, Job,

stop and think about God’s wondrous works.

15Do you know how he controls the clouds

or makes lightning flash in them?

16Can you explain the layers of dark clouds,

the wonders of One that knows everything,

17you whose clothes are hot

because the south wind isn’t blowing?

18Can you spread out the sky like he does,

as hard as a bronze mirror?

19Teach us what to say to him;

we can’t draw up our case without your help!

20Should somebody let him know I want to speak?

Does anyone ever want to be destroyed?

21“We can’t look at the bright light in the sky

after the wind has cleared it.

22Golden splendor comes from the north;

awesome majesty surrounds God.

23We can’t imagine how extremely powerful the Almighty is;

yet he doesn’t violate justice and abundant goodness.

24So people everywhere revere him

because he doesn’t value people that are wise in their own conceit.”

Job 37:14-24

38:1God answered Job out of the whirlwind:

2“Who is this that confuses my counsel

with ignorant words?

3Gird up* like a man;

I’ll ask you some questions, and you answer me.

4Where were you when I laid the foundation for the earth?

Tell me if you have any idea.

5Who specified its measurements

or stretched out a line on it?

Surely you know!

6What did its pylons rest on?

Who laid its cornerstone

7when the morning stars sang together

and all God’s angels shouted for joy?	Job 38:1-7

8“Who shut the ocean in boundaries,

when it came bursting out of the womb,

9when I clothed it with clouds

and swaddled it with deep darkness,

10when I set its boundaries,

bolted its doors,

11and said, ‘You can’t go beyond this point;

here’s where your proud waves stop’?	Job 38:8-11

12“Have you ever commanded the morning

and made dawn happen

13so it can spread to the ends of the earth

and bring to an end night’s evil?

14The earth is stamped like clay under a seal;

its features stand out like folds in a robe.

15Light is withheld from sinners,

and their uplifted arm is broken.	Job 38:12-15

16“Have you traveled to the springs of the ocean

or walked in the recesses of the deep?

17Have the gates of death been revealed to you;

have you seen the doors into deep darkness?

18Do you have any idea how big the earth is?

Tell me if you know that.	Job 38:16-18

19“Where’s the road to where light lives?

Where’s the place for darkness,

20so you can take it to its territory

and make out the paths to its home?

21You know because you were born there, right!

and you’ve lived so long!

22Have you entered the storehouses for snow

or seen where I keep the hail

23I reserve for troubled times,

for the time of war and battle?

24Where’s the road to the source of light

or where the east wind scatters over the earth?	Job 38:19-24

25“Who carved a channel for the flood

or laid out the course of a thunderbolt

26to bring rain on land with no people—

on a vacant desert—

27to satisfy desolate land

and make grass sprout?

28Does rain have a father?

Who has begotten the drops of dew?

29Whose womb did ice come out of?

Who gave birth to frost from the sky?

30Water gets as hard as rock;

its surface freezes over and imprisons the deep. 	Job 38:25-30

31“Can you tie up the chains of the Pleiades

or untie the cords of Orion?

32Can you lead out the signs of the Zodiac in their seasons

and guide the Bear with her cubs?

33Do you know the laws of the sky

or manage the earth with them?

34“Can you shout to the clouds

to get enough water to cover you?

35Do you send out lightning bolts on their way?

Do they report to you, ‘We’re here’?	Job 38:31-35

36“Who endowed the heart with wisdom

or gave intelligence to the mind?

37Who can count the clouds

or tip over the water jars in the sky

38when dust hardens into clumps

and forms clods?	Job 38:36-38

39“Can you stalk prey for a lion

or satisfy the appetite of young lions

40when they crouch in their dens

and lie in wait in their lairs?

41Who fixes feed for the ravens

when their young call out to God

and wander around with nothing to eat?	Job 38:39-41

39:1“Do you know when mountain goats give birth?

Do you ever see a deer calving?

2Can you count the months of their gestation

or learn when they have their fawns?

3They crouch down to deliver their young.

4Their offspring grow strong out in the open;

they leave home and never return.	Job 39:1-4

5“Who turned the wild donkey loose?

Who untied its ropes?

6I gave it the open country for a home,

desert land to live in?

7It scorns city turmoil

and doesn’t have to listen to a driver shout at it.

8It roams the mountains for pasture,

looking for anything green.	Job 39:5-8

9“Will a wild ox consent to serve you

and spend the night at your manger?

10Can you harness it to plow in a furrow?

Will it harrow your fields?

11Will you depend on it because it’s strong

and leave your work for it to do?

12Will you trust it to bring your grain home

and deliver it to your threshing floor?	Job 39:9-12

13“The ostrich’s wings flap happily,

but they don’t compare

with the wings and feathers of a stork.

14She abandons her eggs in the ground

to stay warm in the sand.

15She forgets that a foot may crush them

or a wild ox may tramp on them.

16She’s harsh toward her young as if they weren’t hers;

though her work may be pointless, she doesn’t care,

17because God hasn’t made her wise

or given her intelligence.

18When she jumps up to run,

she laughs at a horse and its rider.	Job 39:13-18

19“Do you give a horse its strength

or cover its neck with a mane?

20Can you make it leap like a locust?

Its majestic snorting is terrifying!

21It paws in the valley and frolics in its strength

and charges out to battle.

22It mocks fear and

doesn’t shy away from the sword.

23The quiver rattles against it,

the flashing spear and javelin too.

24It doesn’t stand still when the bugle signals;

with trembling rage, it races over the ground.

25As often as the bugle blows, it says, ‘Aha!’

It smells a battle a long way off,

the captain’s thundering, and the battle cry.	Job 39:19-25

26“Does a hawk soar because you’re so smart

as it stretches its wings toward the south?

27Does an eagle mount up at your command

and build its nest up high?

28It lives and lodges on the cliffs,

in inaccessible places on the rocky crag.

29From there it spies out prey

that it can see from far away.

30Even its young gulp down blood;

they’re right there when the kill goes down. Job 39:26-30

40:1Yahveh said to Job,

2“Will a faultfinder spar with the Almighty?

Let the one that argues with God answer that.”

3Job said,

4“I’m insignificant; what kind of answer can I give?

I’ve put my hand over my mouth.

5I’ve spoken once or twice; that’s enough;

I don’t have anything else to say.”	Job 40:1-5

6Yahveh answered him out of the storm:

7“Gird up* like a man;

I’ll ask you some questions, and you answer me.

8Will you really try to discredit me to justify yourself?

9Do you have an arm like mine?

Can you thunder like me?  	Job 40:6-9

10“Go ahead and put on eminence and dignity;

dress yourself with honor and majesty.

11Pour out your overflowing anger;

look at everybody that’s proud and humble them.

12Look down on everybody that’s arrogant;

walk on sinners where they stand.

13Bury them in the dust together;

imprison them in the hidden place.

14Then I’ll acknowledge to you

that your own right hand can save you.	Job 40:10-14

15“Look at Behemoth, which I made as well as I did you;

it eats grass like an ox.

16It has strong loins

and powerful muscles in its stomach.

17It swings its tail like a cedar beam;

the sinews in its thighs intertwine.

18Its bones are like bronze tubes;

its limbs, like iron bars.	Job 40:15-18

19It’s a prime example of my what I’ve created;

only the One that made it need bring his sword!

20The mountains produce its food,

where wild animals play.

21It lies down under the lotus plants

and hides among the reeds in the marsh.

22The lotus plants give it shade;

the willows by the stream surround it.

23It doesn’t care if the river rages

or worry if the Jordan rushes at its mouth.

24Can anyone capture it when it’s awake?

Can anybody trap it and put a ring in its nose?	Job 40:19-24

41:1“Can you pull Leviathan in on a fishhook

or muzzle it with a noose?

2Can you tie it up with a rope in its nose

or pierce its jaw with a hook?

3Will it beg you for mercy

or speak to you softly?

4Will it agree to work for you

like a slave for life?

5Will you make a pet out of it like a bird

or put it on a leash for your little girls?

6Will traders bid on it

or divide it up among the merchants’ shops?

7Can you hurt its hide with harpoons

or its head with fishing spears?	Job 41:1-7

8Put your hands on it, and you’ll remember the fight!

You won’t do that again!

9Anything you try to do with it is useless;

the very sight of it is overpowering.

10Nobody is fierce enough to dare to disturb it;

who then can stand against me?

11Who has given to me that I should repay?

Whatever’s under the sky is already mine. 	Job 41:8-11

12“I won’t fail to mention its limbs,

its great strength or graceful frame.

13Who can strip off its outer armor

or penetrate its double coat of mail?

14Who can pry its jaws open?

Its teeth are terrifying!

15It’s proud of its hard scales

that fit together like a seal,

16one so close to the other

that air can’t get between them.

17They interlock with one another

and can’t be separated.

18When it sneezes, it flashes out light;

its eyes are red like the rays of dawn.	Job 41:12-18

19Burning torches blaze out of its mouth;

sparks fly from it.

20Smoke pours out of its nostrils

as from a boiling pot or burning reeds.

21Flames burst out of its mouth;

its breath lights coals.

22It has a strong neck

that strikes panic wherever goes.

23The folds of its flesh fit tightly together,

firm and unmovable.

24Its heart is as hard as rock,

like a lower millstone.

25When it stands up, mighty men scramble

and retreat at its thrashing.

26No sword can hurt it;

neither can a spear, dart, or javelin.	Job 41:19-26

27They glance off like straws;

it deflects bronze weapons like rotten sticks.

28Arrows can’t chase it away;

sling stones amount to wads of sod.

29Clubs do no more harm to it than stubble;

it laughs at rattling javelins.

30Sharp scales like potsherds cover its underbelly;

it leaves grooves in the dirt like a threshing sledge.

31It makes deep water roil like a boiling pot;

it stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.

32The water in its wake foams behind it;

you’d think the deep had gray hair.

33There’s nothing like it on earth;

it’s not afraid of anything.

34It stares down at everything tall;

it’s king over everything arrogant.”	Job 41:27-34

42:1Job answered Yahveh:

2“I know you can do anything

and nobody can thwart what you do.

3You asked, ‘Who is this that darkens my counsel with ignorance?’

So I admit I don’t understand;

these things are too awesome for me to look into.

4You said, ‘Listen; I’ll talk;

I’ll ask; you instruct me.’

5I’d only heard about you before,

but now I see you.

6So I take back what I’ve said

and repent in dust and ashes.”	Job 42:1-6

7After Yahveh spoke to Job, he told Eliphaz the Temanite,

“I’m aggravated with you and your two friends because you haven’t said about me what’s right like Job has. 8So take 7 bulls and 7 rams to him and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. He’ll pray for you, and I’ll accept him so I won’t do to you what you deserve, because you haven’t said about me what’s right like he has.”

9Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what Yahveh said, and he accepted Job.      	    Job 42:7-9

10When Job prayed for his friends, Yahveh restored his fortunes and doubled what he had before. 11Then his brothers, sisters, and acquaintances that knew him before, came to eat with him in his house. They consoled him for the misfortunes Yahveh had let come on him. Each one gave him one piece of money and a gold ring. 12Yahveh blessed Job’s later life more than its beginning. He had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. 13He had 7 sons and 3 daughters. 14He named the firstf Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 15In the whole land there weren’t any women as beautiful as his daughters. Their father gave them an inheritance alongside their brothers. 16After that, Job lived 140 years and saw his grandsons and great-grandsons, four generations. 17He died an old man that had lived a full life.		Job 42:10-17
