The benediction slot appears at the end of the service. In popular usage “benediction” has become a label for the closing prayer, but a benediction is really a pronouncement of blessing on those assembled for worship or on God as a final statement of praise. The biblical texts given below can serve as a word of praise to God or a word of blessing on the worshipers as they are about to leave.

Obviously, a worship assembly does not have to close in any particular way. It may end with a benediction, a prayer, a unison reading, or a closing song. The service leader could end the gathering by a statement of encouragement to the congregation and an admonition to greet one another.

A benediction may be a reading from scripture or a spontaneous statement of blessing by the presider on those assembled. It may be a statement of praise to God as a final note to summarize the effect of the worship gathering. If the benediction is a reading from scripture or elsewhere, it is probably more effective if memorized and stated while using eye contact with the assembly.

A closing prayer could connect a central point in the sermon with a request that God help us live up to the ideals of that message in the coming days as a testimony to other people; it can be a statement of commitment to do so.

“Day by day and with each passing moment” can be used effectively as a closing song. The congregation might sing the first two verses and then read in unison the last verse as a prayer because it is addressed to God in the second person.
