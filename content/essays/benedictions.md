BENEDICTIONS

The benediction slot appears at the end of the service. In popular usage “benediction” has become a label for the closing prayer, but a benediction is really a pronouncement of blessing on those assembled for worship or on God as a final statement of praise. The biblical texts given below can serve as a word of praise to God or a word of blessing on the worshipers as they are about to leave.

Genesis 31:49b: “The Lord watch between me and you when we are absent one from another.”

*Numbers 6:24-26: “The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine on you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up his countenance on you and give you peace.”

Let him not leave us or forsake us, that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the Lord be near to the Lord our God day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people . . . as every day will require, that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God; there is none else.

Jeremiah 31:33-34: “This is the covenant that I . . . make with the house of Israel . . . : I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart I will write it. And I will be their God and they will be my people.

Obviously, a worship assembly does not have to close in any particular way. It may end with a benediction, a prayer, a unison reading, or a closing song. The service leader could end the gathering by a statement of encouragement to the congregation and an admonition to greet one another.

A benediction may be a reading from scripture or a spontaneous statement of blessing by the presider on those assembled. It may be a statement of praise to God as a final note to summarize the effect of the worship gathering. If the benediction is a reading from scripture or elsewhere, it is probably more effective if memorized and stated while using eye contact with the assembly.

A closing prayer could connect a central point in the sermon with a request that God help us live up to the ideals of that message in the coming days as a testimony to other people; it can be a statement of commitment to do so.

“Day by day and with each passing moment” can be used effectively as a closing song. The congregation might sing the first two verses and then read in unison the last verse as a prayer because it is addressed to God in the second person.
