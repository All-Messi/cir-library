TWO SYSTEMS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS

LAW [Moses]	GRACE [Messiah] (IP)

Purpose of both: human righteousness (Gal. 3:21)

Righteousness is for fellowship

with God and other people (IP).

Law and grace are parallel1 as to identity and kind

(Jer. 31:31-34 <Heb. 8:7-10:18; John 1:17; Rom 4:13-14; Gal. 3:21).

Principle of personal perfection (1 person)	Principle of trust in another to consider us

Deut 27:26; Lev. 18:5 (works	as perfect (Gen. 15:6; Hab 2:4)

to produce goodness); righteousness is	one repents;  	the other forgives

perfect righteousness: “continue to do all.”	one trusts;		the other gives grace

one commits to Christ; Christ accepts

Regarding as righteous is possible (Ps. 32:1-

2 < Rom. 4:6-8).

No righteousness under law

a. cannot be perfect (Ps. & Is. < Rom 3)	Regarding as righteous based on

b. cannot become perfect (Gal. 5:1)	aspiration counted for achievement,

c. no transfer of perfection (Lev. 18:5)	repentance (cp. John the Baptist),

d. cannot rely on ancestry, race, nation,	faith in/trust Christ’s righteousness,

circumcision	commitment to him who is righteous,

e. cannot rely on revelation/knowing	conscience (unevangelized; Rom. 2:12ff;

(law only defines good: Gal. 3:19; 		Golden Rule living; Mt. 7:12)

Rom. 5:20)	All salvation figured relative to Christ:

f. sacrifices ineffective (Heb. 10:4)	after him (Acts 4:12; no other name),

g. no one to regard us as good (Rom. 4:4)	Mosaic period (Heb. 9:15),

Gentiles and Jews unrighteous (Rom. 3:19, 23)	patriarchal period (1 Pet. 3:18-21; 4:6

Jews only relatively good: Lk. 1:6; Phil. 3:6	(hence, do not have to know about

him to be saved by him).

no boasting (Rom. 3:27)	no pride

absolute scale judgment	sliding-scale judgment

1Alternative systems means that law and grace are not the same thing, do not overlap, or lie one within the other. Righteousness by Messiah does not operate within law, only during law. Judaizers were evidently taking Israel’s Messiah as fulfilling the Law so that Gentiles by identifying with him were in turn to identify with Israel by circumcision as still required to be saved (Acts 15:1). There would still be no salvation outside of national Israel; so to the Judaizers, grace amended the Law, not replaced it.
