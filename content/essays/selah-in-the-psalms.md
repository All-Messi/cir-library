SELAH IN THE PSALMS

I. Derivation of סֶלָה

A.	From the root סלה, “to rest” or “be silent.” סֶלָה (penult accent) is taken as a pausal form of סֶלָה (ultima accent), directing the leader to pause or be silent presumably for an instrumental interlude (Gesenius).It always has the same form.

B.  From סלה, “to lift up” (Sampey, Leupold, and “most modern scholars”). It is thus a direction

1. to the orchestra “to raise” the volume of the accompaniment momentarily—like a fortissimo or sforzando.

2.  to the reader “to increase” the volume of the reading.

3.  to the congregation “to lift up” their voices in benediction—like an amen.

II. Against סלה, “to be silent”

A.	It is a rather doubtful Hebrew root that does not seem to occur anywhere in the text of the Old Testament.

B.	It would necessitate stopping the reading (though perhaps only for a pause like a sforzando, or emphatic blast of the accompaniment).

1.  סֶלָה occurs (rarely) in the middle of a verse: Psalm 55:19; 57:3; Habakkuk 3:3;

3:9.

2.  It sometimes occurs where there is no natural break in thought (see VII).

C.  Selah, “to be silent,” would be superfluous at the end of a psalm.

1.  Passages (see Chart IV): Psalm 3:8; 9:20; 24:10; 46:11; 88:10

2.  For some reason, the Septuagint omits all the selahs at the end of the psalms except for Psalm 9, which it combines with Psalm 10. Whatever the reason, the LXX translators did not seem to understand סלה to mean “be silent” because they did not translate it that way.

III. In support of the root סלה, “to lift up”

A.	It is a less obscure root—although that fact might tell against this derivation since its meaning was evidently uncertain by the time of Aquila (died about A.D. 150). Perhaps the meaning was lost during the exile, when the temple performance of the psalms was not possible.

B.	The usages of סלה in the text of the Old Testament (Job 28:16, 19; Psalm 119:118; Lamentations 1:15) seem to come from this root.

1. It means “to value” in Job 28:16, 19 (“to lift up,” hence, “to suspend,” then “to

weigh”).

2.  It means “to condemn” in Psalm 119:118; Lamentations 1:5. What can be raised

is light; hence, unimportant. Light and weighty are used this way in English for

“insignificant” and “important” respectively.

C.	They are all poetic passages (as were the Psalms and Habakkuk).

D.  The Job passages show that it was a root in use at a time early enough for all the usages in the Psalms.

E.  The LXX always translates סלה with διάψαλμα. Symmachus and Theodotian usually do also.

1.  διάψαλμα is a word of expression rather than silence. Διά means “through” or

“th(o)roughly”; ψάλλω means “to pluck an instrument.”

2.  If סלה meant “silence” (for a musical interlude to be raised), the Septuagint

would not be translating directly, but would be using a word for what

occurred during the pause rather than referring to the pause itself.

F.	In Job 21:12 the root סלה, meaning “to lift up,” is used in a musical context similar

to the proposed usage of סֶלָה: “They sing [lift up] to the timbrel and harp and

rejoice at the sound of the pipe.”

G.	Selah does not necessitate interrupting the reading in those places where selah would seem to interrupt the thought.

V. Alternatives for explaining its usages

A.  Selah is a word in the meaning of the psalm itself. Aquila so understood it in his Greek translation of the Old Testament and rendered it “always.” Jerome in his Latin vulgate followed Aquila, translating it “always” (semper).

B.	Selah is a word of direction for the performance of the psalm.

VI. Against selah meaning “ever” or “always,” as part of the psalm itself

A.  At least one passage would seem to be self-contradictory if this were the meaning of selah: Psalm 7:5 says, “Yea, let him tread my life down to earth, and lay my glory in the dust (always)”; whereas 7:6 calls for Yahveh to lift himself up against David’s enemies and deliver him.

B.  Some passages already contain the element of eternity:

1.  Psalm 44:8: “And we will give thanks to your name forever (always).”

2.  Psalm 48:8: “God will establish it forever (always).”

3.  Psalm 55:19: “God will hear and answer them, even he that abides of old

(always).”

4.  Psalm 89:4: “I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne to all

generations (always).”

C.	The action in some passages is punctiliar rather than linear. It is an action or event

that occurs once instead of continually or many times.

1.  Psalm 49:15: “But God will redeem my hand from the power of Sheol, for he

will receive me (always).”

2.  Psalm 52:5: “He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you

out of the land of the living (always).”

3.  Psalm 57:6: “They have dug a pit before me; they have fallen into the midst

thereof themselves (always).”

4.  Psalm 81:7: “I tested you at the waters of Meribah (always).”

5.  Psalm 87:6: “Yahveh will count when he adds up the peoples; this one was

born there (always).”

6.  Habakkuk 3:3: “God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran

(always).”

D.	There is no known Hebrew root in (ה) +ל+ ס with the meaning “always.”

E.	The LXX puts the translation of סלה on a separate line (unless this is simply an

editorial device of Ralphs).

F.	The sense is always complete without it; it stands apart syntactically.

VII. In favor of selah meaning “life up,” relating to the orchestral performance of the psalm

(rather than to the reader or audience)

A.	The LXX’s word ψάλλω, “to pluck,” fits with “lifting up”—as in a musical interlude.

B. 	It usually stands in the middle of the psalm.

1.  All references but five

a.  69 of the 73 usages in the Hebrew text

b.  The LXX adds 5, always in the middle of the psalm: 34:10 (= 33:11); 50:15 (= 49:15); 68:13 (= 67:14); 80:7 (= 79:8); 94:15 (= 93:15). It omits those at the end of the psalms (and 88:10).

2.  Those at the end of the psalms (3:8; 9:20; 24:10; 46:11) may be like fanfare

postludes.

C.	It frequently stands at the major breaks in the text.

1.  passages where natural breaks occur:

3.	Summary

a.  37 occurrences at major divisions of the outline

b.  4 occurrences in unnatural breaks

c.  23 occurrences where there are no major divisions

D.	It occasionally stands with recurring elements for emphasis

1.  Psalm 39:5, 11: appears after “Surely every man (at his best estate) is altogether vanity”: it makes breath (vanity) a key word.

2.  Psalm 66:4, 7, 15: precedes (4, 15) the commands to come and hear; the other (7) precedes another major imperative.

3.  Psalm 46:7, 11: follows the expression the God of Jacob is our refuge.

E.  It does not appear frequently per psalm.

1.  It appears only once in 15 psalms.

2.  It appears twice in 15 psalms.

3.  It appears three times in 7 psalms and in Habakkuk 3.

4.  It appears four times in only one Hebrew text (i.e., Psalm 89: add Psalm 32 and Psalm 68 in LXX).

5.  It never occurs in successive verses.

F.	Selah appears in 7 psalms whose headings mention an instrument.

1.  Psalms that mention instruments in the title and use selah in the body: 42, 54, 552, 762, Habakkuk 33.

2.  The two exceptions are Psalm 5 and Psalm 6.

3.  That phenomenon involves 13 of the 74 occurrences of selah.

G.	Selah appears in 37 of the 96 psalms composed by known instrumentalists (in 17 of the 24 written by other than David; perhaps the difference is due to the fact that David flourished before the temple worship was fully established with its set patters of accompaniment).

1.  In 20 of the 72 Davidic psalms (according to the Hebrew text)

a.  In Psalm 33, 42, 7, 92, 20, 21, 242, 323, 392, 522, 54, 552, 572, 592, 60, 61, 622, 682, 1403, 143.

b.  Not in Psalm 5, 6, 8, 11-19, 22-23, 25-31, 34-38, 40-41, 51, 53, 56, 58, 63-65, 69-70, 86, 101, 103, 108-110, 122, 124, 131, 133, 138-139, 141-142, 144-145.

2.  In the one psalm of Heman the Ezrahite, Psalm 88. Heman is mentioned elsewhere in 1 Kings 4:31; 1 Chronicles 6:33; 15:17, 19; 16:41, 42; 25:1, 42, 52, 6; 2 Chronicles 5:12; 29:14; 35:15. He sang before the tabernacle (2 Chronicles 6:32-33); he was one of the three first-level musicians at the time of David (1 Chronicles 15:17); he was a player of brass cymbals (1 Chronicles 15:19), of trumpets (1 Chronicles 16:42), harps, and psalteries (1 Chronicles 25:1), and horn (1 Chronicles 25:5).

3.  In one psalm of Ethan the Ezrahite, Psalm 89. Ethan, Heman, and Asaph appear together in 1 Kings 15:19; 1 Chronicles 6:22, 39, 44.

4.  In 7 of the 12 psalms of Asaph (in Psalm 50, 75, 762, 81, 82, 83; but not in Psalm 73, 74, 78, 79, 80).

5.  In 9 of the 11 psalms by the sons of Korah. The sons of Korah were Levites according to 2 Chronicles 20:19, who praised God during the reign of Jehosophat. The succeeding contexts in verses 20-22 recount Jehosophat’s appointing certain ones to sing to the Lord and go out before the army in “holy array.” “Holy array” best fits the sons of Korah mentioned previously. If so, then they were also musicians; because, upon their return from the successful campaign, the text says, “They came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of Yahveh” (20:28). Heman was a musician who composed Psalm 88, which is also attributed to the sons of Korah. Heman was a Levite and probably the specific “son of Korah” who composed Psalm 88. Thus the sons of Korah were probably instrumentalists as well as singers

6.	In Psalm 44, 463, 47, 48, 492, 842, 85, 872, and 882; but not in Psalm 42, 45.

H.	Selah appears in 7 of the 15 psalms that say “set to ______.”

1.  In 1 psalm “set to Methlabben” (Psalm 9);

In 3 of the 4 psalms “set to Altashheth” (Psalm 57, 59, 75; but not in Psalm 58);

In the 1 psalm “set to Mahalath Leannoth” (Psalm 88);

In the 1 psalm “set to Shushan Eduth” (Psalm 60);

In the 1 psalm “set to Alamoth” (Psalm 46).

2.  Not in the 1 psalm “set to Mahalath” (Psalm 53);

Not in 2 psalms “set to the Sheminith” (Psalm 6, 12);

Not in the 1 psalm “set to Aijeleth Hash-Shachar” (Psalm 22);

Not in the 3 psalms “set to Shoshannim” (Psalm 45, 69, 80);

Not in the 1 psalm “set to Jonath Elem Rehokim” (Psalm 56).

I.	Selah occurs in 20 of the 57 psalms called מִזְמוֹר (root זמר, “to touch, to strike, to play an instrument").

1.  in Psalm 3, 4, 9, 20-21, 24, 39, 47-50, 62, 82- 85, 87-88, 140;

2.  not in Psalm 5-6, 8, 12-13, 15, 19, 22-23, 29-31, 38, 40-41, 63-68, 73, 75-77, 79-80, 92, 98, 101-102, 108-110, 139, 141

J.	A summary of observations

1.  Although selah does not always appear in psalms whose titles have some sort of musical element, it never appears in a psalm that lacks some sort of musical element.

2.  It never appears in a psalm that has no title: 1, 2, 10, 33, 43, 71, 72, 90, 91, 93, 97, 99, 104, 105-107, 111-119, 135-137, 146-150.

3.  It does not appear in the songs of ascents—even though David’s name is attached to 122, 124, 131, and 133—presumably because the worshipers used them along the way on the pilgrimages to Jerusalem rather than in the temple. Music would be more difficult to supply while traveling.

4.	Selah appears in 6 of the 17 psalms that mention a musical instrument:

harp (כִּנּוֹר, Psalm 33:2; 43:4; 49:4; 57:8; 71:22; 81:2; 92:3; 98:5; 108:2; 137:2; 147:7; 149:3; 150:3);

instrument (כִּלִי, Psalm 71:22);

organ (עוּגָב, Psalm 150:40);

ten-stringed instrument (עָשׂוֹר, Psalm 33:2; 92:3);

timbrel תֹּף), Psalm 81:2; 149:3; 150:4);

timbrel (תֻּפָּף, Psalm 68:25(;

trumpet (הֲצֹצְרָה, Psalm 98:6);

trumpet (שׁוֹפָר, Psalm 47:5; 81:3; 98:6; 150:3);

cymbal (מְצִלְתַּיִם, Psalm 150:5);

viol (נַבֶל, Psalm 33:2; 57:8; 71:22; 81:2; 92:3; 108:9; 144:9; 150:3).

So, selah appears with instrument indications in Psalm 47, 49, 57, 68, 81, 87; but not in Psalm 33, 43, 71, 92, 98, 108, 137, 144, 147, 149, 150.
