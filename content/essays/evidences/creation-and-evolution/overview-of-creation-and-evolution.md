I. Preliminary Definitions and Concepts


A.	God: label for ultimate reality


B.	God’s relationship to the universe


1.	Natural imminence: God is not distinct in kind from the universe.



*2.	Natural transcendence: God is distinct in kind from the universe.




C.	Change


1.	Modification: change without increasing the number of harmoniously

integrated factors.

*2.	Complexification: change with increasing the number of harmoniously

integrated factors.


D. 	Causation


1.	Natural cause: an effect produced by a cause inside nature.

*2.	Miracle: an effect produced by a cause outside nature.


E.	Creationism: complexification via factor(s) external to the natural realm.


F.	Evolution: complexification via factor(s) internal to the natural realm.


1.	Micro-evolution: demonstrable change in matters of degree

*2.	Macro-evolution: extrapolated change into matters of kind.


II. Models of Creation


Creation involves transcendent deity that, among other acts, brings mass/energy into existence from nothing and complexifies by miracle irrespective of time rate. The natural order has a finite beginning and possesses order because of the common Mind that lies behind the origin of "parts" whether created directly from nothing (fiat) or using previously existing created mass/energy.


A.	Short-term creationism


1.	Type A: creation from nothing to final form in approximately a week’s time;

earth’s age is in the order of 10,000 to 30,000 years.

2.	Type B: 	same as above except that creative process occurred in terms of years, and the earth’s age is longer in varying degrees according to the theorist’s framework.


B.	Long-term creationism


3.	Ruin-reconstruction: the present form of the earth is one of several

destructions followed by new beginnings of divine creativity.

4.	Progressive Creationism Type A: polyphyletic

5.	Progressive Creationism Type B: monophyletic


III. Models of Evolution


Evolution is complexification over time by internal natural laws operating with or

without beginning or end.


A.	Relative to God


1.	Theistic evolution: transcendent deity is only involved in the creation from nothing and by building into the natural order the principles potential for nature’s complexifying itself.

2.	Atheistic evolution: mass/energy is eternal and self-complexifying. (If the view of God is not that of transcendent deity, then what we call atheistic is also theistic but no external causation is involved; hence, we do not call it “creation” even if something new comes about.)


B.	As to pattern: assorted terms


1.	Emergent evolution

2.	Punctuated equilibrium

3.	Vitalism
