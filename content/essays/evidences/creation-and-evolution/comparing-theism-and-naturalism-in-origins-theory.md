style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A formal similarity could be seen between “emergent
evolution” and progressive creationism. The “emergent points” of emergent
evolution might appear to <u>correlate with</u> the “intervention points” of
progressive revelation. From a scientist’s viewpoint, we could consider the
possibility that a connector in a progression is a natural one rather than a
supernatural one, as previously supposed. We may not already know that a
natural “force” exists for accomplishing this complexification. There is a
difference, however, between keeping the natural category <u>potential</u> for
explanation in such cases and making it the <u>necessary</u> category for
explanation by disallowing the supernatural category in principle. The latter
is what methodological naturalism does by assuming that its method, good in
itself, somehow becomes the only legitimate method. Creationists, however, want
to keep the supernatural category open after the initial creation of
mass-energy. The formal similarity is limited because of the internal-external
variable in the respective formats at their correlating junction points.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The countering charge could be given that
the exogenous-endogenous distinction has the essential value of pronouncing
methodological naturalism wrong. It might be nothing more than trying to “dispense
with a method by mere definition.” But the approach does more than give a
variant <u>definition</u> of the same phenomenon; it gives a different <u>explanation</u>
of it. The approach objects to the presupposition that all answers <u>must</u>
be naturalistic even though it allows for appealing to natural explanation in
any individual case and therefore allows for any corresponding research or
theorizing in terms of natural explanations. The creationist conviction that
not <u>all</u> individual cases will, or can, be naturalistically explained
comes <b>(1) </b>not from factors that we do <u>not</u> know, but in an
increasing way it comes from factors that we <u>do</u> know and know
scientifically. Stated in terms of likelihood, the more we learn about the
higher-than-previously-thought complexity-level of things, the less likely it
becomes that random operation of fundamental natural laws can account for the
emergence of some relatively complex entity by endogenous complexification from
the nearest less complex item “below” it. The same is true of specific organs
like the eye, the brain, the reproductive system, <i>etc.</i> Prior to the
discovery of DNA, chromosomes, genes, the double helix, and other genetic
features, evolution was easier to hypothesize than it is now, because in
reproduction and development we are evidently dealing with cybernetics more
than sheer chemistry.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, <b>(2)</b> as cases that
mosaics highlight (a feathered-mammal type, <i>e.g</i>.), the problem is not
just a straight-line progression from fewer to more (change of number or
degree), but a change of kind—a change from one <u>gestalt</u> to another. It
is more than a matter of intensifying the degree of a characteristic or a set
of them, adding and subtracting parts, modifying the form and function of
homologous parts, or even all three. It is a matter of changing kinds, which
brings in the harmonious, necessary, reciprocal interdependent operation of
subunits to make a whole. <u>It is not possible to seriate the origin of reciprocating
parts</u> necessary for the viability of the whole and the parts themselves, especially
given the huge number of such parts in even the “lower” life forms. It is not
possible to bring about the gradual origin of a reciprocating gestalt—at least
without using external mind, which involves intervention, and we are right back
to exogenous complexification again. In the case of interdependent parts, all
parts must be present from the beginning, fully functional, and interactive. It
would do no good somehow to get everything involved in a bisexual mammalian
self-replicating organism except getting the other sex, except getting the
instincts for copulation, except getting the drive to care for the offspring—or
worse yet, except having the mechanisms for birth contractions and other
related factors. Besides, this process must happen twice simultaneously nearby
and variant in an interdependent way between two sexes so as to produce both
sexes in a subsequently combinational way.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, <b>(3)</b> there is an
essentially historical source of information (scripture) that indicates the
supernatural origin of the material realm at the level of the whole and
apparently excludes endogenous evolution as the explanation for at least <u>every</u>
sub-unit within it. This third point, of course, has to be worked out relative
to reasons for accepting Jesus Christ as Messiah and the concomitant acceptance
of his view of things, his disciples’ views of things, the general reliability
of the records of such views, <i>etc.</i> The reliability of scripture’s view
of a matter like origins cannot be dealt with individually and directly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Now the hermeneutical aspect of this last
observation may not be absolutely foolproof. An evolutionary explanation of <u>mankind’s</u>
origin is surely outside the limits of what one would ever suppose scripture
intended by what it says about origins and by the associated records it
preserves regarding human history. If creation was not the case with humans, it
is less likely that they were the <u>only</u> discrete creation within a whole
as large as this creation. Even if people were the only life form originated
exogenously, the essential theological point would already be made: human
beings are not so much like animal “below” them as they are like God “above” them
in whose image scripture says they were created and should then live. Pragmatically
speaking, the crucial issue in the creation-evolution controversy is the
anthropological one. Our view of ourselves is our most important concern both in
theory and practice, because it sets the category in which our subsequent
considerations take place and establishes the most fundamental factor in
ethical theory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Speaking of “likelihood” brings up a point
in applying the law of parsimony. It does seem sensible to say that, all things
being equal, the simpler explanation is more likely correct. Both
methodological naturalists and Christian theists appeal to parsimony in their
respective approaches to origins issues, but they appeal to it in different ways.
On the one hand, materialistic scientists see the simpler explanation rightly
as one that involves <u>fewer causal components</u>; it is “less complex”
because God is not added to the picture. We, too, are normally more prone to
suppose a medical explanation than a supernatural one even though we affirm
with all our being that there is a God, that he relates to his creation, and
that he answers the prayers for the sick among his people. Christians, on the
other hand, see it as “simpler” to emphasize <u>sufficient cause</u>. For us it
is not so much the lower <u>number</u> of factors that makes an answer simpler
but the <u>sufficiency</u> of the factors whatever their number. Natural causes
operating randomly are not adequate for explaining the origin of the truly new
and therefore the <u>kinds</u> of results already present. The real situation,
then, is apt to combine fewer <u>and</u> better factors, which keeps God in the
picture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some authors have expressed the opinion
(Till, <i>e.g</i>.) that it would be incoherent for a God who created the
universe over eons of time to turn around and create humankind by fiat. It is
not clear how the first observation, if granted, relates to the second. Being
eternal in both directions, God need not hurry nor drag things out. The very
notion of long <i>vs</i>. short time within endless time loses much of its
coherence by losing much of the framework for establishing relativity. The “urgency”
factor implied by finiteness does not obtain in an eternal God’s circumstance. Also,
much of what is theorized about the formation of planets after big bangs, <i>etc</i>.,
is more conceivably explanable on naturalistic lines because, for one thing, it
lies in the inorganic realm. If natural causation can effect such results, God
might simply let the system run until it did what it could; the length of time
would be a function of method, and method would derive from endogenous
capacities. In the case of originating a life form like humankind, however, no
amount of time could generate the effect because nature lacks the mechanisms
for doing it. If a result comes by creation, it is quite naturally
instantaneous.</span></p>
