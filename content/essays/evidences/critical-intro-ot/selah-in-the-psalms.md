I. Derivation of סֶלָה

A.	From the root סלה, “to rest” or “be silent.” סֶלָה (penult accent) is taken as a pausal form of סֶלָה (ultima accent), directing the leader to pause or be silent presumably for an instrumental interlude (Gesenius).It always has the same form.

B.  From סלה, “to lift up” (Sampey, Leupold, and “most modern scholars”). It is thus a direction

1. to the orchestra “to raise” the volume of the accompaniment momentarily—like a <em>fortissimo</em> or <em>sforzando</em>.

2.  to the reader “to increase” the volume of the reading.

3.  to the congregation “to lift up” their voices in benediction—like an <em>amen</em>.

II. Against סלה, “to be silent”

A.	It is a rather doubtful Hebrew root that does not seem to occur anywhere in the text of the Old Testament.

B.	It would necessitate stopping the reading (though perhaps only for a pause like a <em>sforzando</em>, or emphatic blast of the accompaniment).

1.  סֶלָה occurs (rarely) in the middle of a verse: Psalm<strong> 55</strong>:19; <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>:3; Habakkuk <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:3;

<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:9.

2.  It sometimes occurs where there is no natural break in thought (see VII).

C.  <em>Selah</em>, “to be silent,” would be superfluous at the end of a psalm.

1.  Passages (see Chart IV): Psalm <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:8; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:20; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:10; <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>:11; <strong><sup>88</sup></strong>:10

2.  For some reason, the Septuagint omits all the <em>selahs</em> at the end of the psalms except for Psalm <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>, which it combines with Psalm <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>. Whatever the reason, the LXX translators did not seem to understand סלה to mean “be silent” because they did not translate it that way.


III. In support of the root סלה, “to lift up”

A.	It is a less obscure root—although that fact might tell against this derivation since its meaning was evidently uncertain by the time of Aquila (died about A.D. 150). Perhaps the meaning was lost during the exile, when the temple performance of the psalms was not possible.

B.	The usages of סלה in the text of the Old Testament (Job <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>:16, 19; Psalm <strong><sup>119</sup></strong>:118; Lamentations <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:15) seem to come from this root.

1. It means “to value” in Job <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>:16, 19 (“to lift up,” hence, “to suspend,” then “to

weigh”).

2.  It means “to condemn” in Psalm <strong><sup>119</sup></strong>:118; Lamentations<strong> 1</strong>:5. What can be raised

is light; hence, unimportant. <em>Light</em> and <em>weighty</em> are used this way in English for

“insignificant” and “important” respectively.

C.	They are all poetic passages (as were the Psalms and Habakkuk).

D.  The Job passages show that it was a root in use at a time early enough for all the usages in the Psalms.

E.  The LXX always translates סלה with διάψαλμα. Symmachus and Theodotian usually do also.

1.  διάψαλμα is a word of expression rather than silence. Διά means “through” or

“th(o)roughly”; ψάλλω means “to pluck an instrument.”

2.  If סלה meant “silence” (for a musical interlude to be raised), the Septuagint

would not be translating directly, but would be using a word for what

occurred during the pause rather than referring to the pause itself.


F.	In Job <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:12 the root סלה, meaning “to lift up,” is used in a musical context similar

to the proposed usage of סֶלָה: <em>“They sing [lift up] to the timbrel and harp and </em>

<em>	rejoice at the sound of the pipe.”  </em>

G.	<em>Selah </em>does not necessitate interrupting the reading in those places where <em>selah</em> would seem to interrupt the thought.

V. Alternatives for explaining its usages

A.  <em>Selah</em> is a word in the meaning of the psalm itself. Aquila so understood it in his Greek translation of the Old Testament and rendered it “always.” Jerome in his Latin vulgate followed Aquila, translating it “always” (<em>semper</em>).

B.	<em>Selah</em> is a word of direction for the performance of the psalm.

VI. Against <em>selah</em> meaning “ever” or “always,” as part of the psalm itself

A.  At least one passage would seem to be self-contradictory if this were the meaning of <em>selah</em>: Psalm<strong> 7</strong>:5 says, <em>“Yea, let him tread my life down to earth, and lay my glory in the dust (always)”</em>; whereas <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:6 calls for Yahveh to lift himself up against David’s enemies and deliver him.

B.  Some passages already contain the element of eternity:

1.  Psalm <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>:8: <em>“And we will give thanks to your name forever (always).”</em>

2.  Psalm <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>:8:<em> “God will establish it forever (always).”</em>

3.  Psalm <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>:19: <em>“God will hear and answer them, even he that abides of old </em>

<em>				  (always).”</em>

4.  Psalm <strong><sup>89</sup></strong>:4: <em>“I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne to all </em>

<em>				  generations (always).”</em>

C.	The action in some passages is punctiliar rather than linear. It is an action or event

that occurs once instead of continually or many times.

1.  Psalm <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>:15: <em>“But God will redeem my hand from the power of Sheol, for he </em>

<em>				  will receive me (always).”</em>

2.  Psalm <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>:5: <em>“He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you </em>

<em>				  out of the land of the living (always).”</em>

3.  Psalm <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>:6: <em>“They have dug a pit before me; they have fallen into the midst </em>

<em>			 	  thereof themselves (always).”</em>

4.  Psalm <strong><sup>81</sup></strong>:7: <em>“I tested you at the waters of Meribah (always).”</em>

5.  Psalm <strong><sup>87</sup></strong>:6: <em>“Yahveh will count when he adds up the peoples; this one was </em>

<em>				  born there (always).”</em>

6.  Habakkuk <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:3: <em>“God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran </em>

<em>				  (always).”</em>

D.	There is no known Hebrew root in (ה) +ל+ ס with the meaning “always.”

E.	The LXX puts the translation of סלה on a separate line (unless this is simply an

editorial device of Ralphs).

F.	The sense is always complete without it; it stands apart syntactically.

VII. In favor of <em>selah</em> meaning “life up,” relating to the orchestral performance of the psalm

(rather than to the reader or audience)

A.	The LXX’s word ψάλλω, “to pluck,” fits with “lifting up”—as in a musical interlude.

B. 	It usually stands in the middle of the psalm.

1.  All references but five

a.  69 of the 73 usages in the Hebrew text

b.  The LXX adds 5, always in the middle of the psalm: <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>:10 (=<strong> 33</strong>:11); <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>:15 (= <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>:15); <strong><sup>68</sup></strong>:13 (= <strong><sup>67</sup></strong>:14); <strong><sup>80</sup></strong>:7 (= <strong><sup>79</sup></strong>:8); <strong><sup>94</sup></strong>:15 (= <strong><sup>93</sup></strong>:15). It omits those at the end of the psalms (and <strong><sup>88</sup></strong>:10).

2.  Those at the end of the psalms (<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:8; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:20; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:10;<strong> 46</strong>:11) may be like fanfare

postludes.

C.	It frequently stands at the major breaks in the text.

3.	Summary

a.  37 occurrences at major divisions of the outline

b.  4 occurrences in unnatural breaks

c.  23 occurrences where there are no major divisions

D.	It occasionally stands with recurring elements for emphasis

1.  Psalm <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>:5, 11: appears <em>after “Surely every man (at his best estate) is altogether vanity”</em>: it makes <em>breath</em> (vanity) a key word.

2.  Psalm<strong> 66</strong>:4, 7, 15: precedes (4, 15) the commands to come and hear; the other (7) precedes another major imperative.

3.  Psalm <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>:7, 11: follows the expression <em>the God of Jacob is our refuge.</em>

E.  It does not appear frequently per psalm.

1.  It appears only once in 15 psalms.

2.  It appears twice in 15 psalms.

3.  It appears three times in 7 psalms and in Habakkuk <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>.

4.  It appears four times in only one Hebrew text (<em>i.e.</em>, Psalm<strong> 89</strong>: add Psalm <strong><sup>32</sup></strong> and Psalm <strong><sup>68</sup></strong> in LXX).

5.  It never occurs in successive verses.

F.	<em>Selah</em> appears in 7 psalms whose headings mention an instrument.

1.  Psalms that mention instruments in the title and use <em>selah</em> in the body: <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>76</sup></strong>2, Habakkuk <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>3.

2.  The two exceptions are Psalm <strong><sup>5</sup></strong> and Psalm<strong> 6</strong>.

3.  That phenomenon involves 13 of the 74 occurrences of <em>selah</em>.

G.	<em>Selah</em> appears in 37 of the 96 psalms composed by known instrumentalists (in 17 of the 24 written by other than David; perhaps the difference is due to the fact that David flourished before the temple worship was fully established with its set patters of accompaniment).

1.  In 20 of the 72 Davidic psalms (according to the Hebrew text)

a.  In Psalm <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>3, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>2,<strong> 7</strong>, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>3, <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>61</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>62</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>68</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>140</sup></strong>3, <strong>143.</strong>

b.  Not in Psalm <strong>5, 6, 8, 11-19, 22-23, 25-31, 34-38, 40-41, 51, 53, 56, 58, 63-65, 69-70, 86, 101, 103, 108-110, 122, 124, 131, 133, 138-139, 141-142, 144-145.</strong>


2.  In the one psalm of Heman the Ezrahite, Psalm <strong><sup>88</sup></strong>. Heman is mentioned elsewhere in 1 Kings<strong> 4</strong>:31; 1 Chronicles <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:33; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:17, 19; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:41, 42; <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>:1, 42, 52, 6; 2 Chronicles <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>:14;<strong> 35</strong>:15. He sang before the tabernacle (2 Chronicles <strong>6:</strong>32-33); he was one of the three first-level musicians at the time of David (1 Chronicles <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:17); he was a player of brass cymbals (1 Chronicles <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:19), of trumpets (1 Chronicles<strong> 16</strong>:42), harps, and psalteries (1 Chronicles <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>:1), and horn (1 Chronicles <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>:5).

3.  In one psalm of Ethan the Ezrahite, Psalm<strong> 89</strong>. Ethan, Heman, and Asaph appear together in 1 Kings <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:19; 1 Chronicles<strong> 6</strong>:22, 39, 44.

4.  In 7 of the 12 psalms of Asaph (in Psalm<strong> 50</strong>, <strong><sup>75</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>76</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>81</sup></strong>, 82, <strong><sup>83</sup></strong>; but not in Psalm <strong><sup>73</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>74</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>78</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>79</sup></strong>, 80).

5.  In 9 of the 11 psalms by the sons of Korah. The sons of Korah were Levites according to 2 Chronicles <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:19, who praised God during the reign of Jehosophat. The succeeding contexts in verses 20-22 recount Jehosophat’s appointing certain ones to sing to the Lord and go out before the army in “holy array.” “Holy array” best fits the sons of Korah mentioned previously. If so, then they were also musicians; because, upon their return from the successful campaign, the text says, <em>“They came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of Yahveh”</em> (<strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:28). Heman was a musician who composed Psalm <strong><sup>88</sup></strong>, which is also attributed to the sons of Korah. Heman was a Levite and probably the specific “son of Korah” who composed Psalm <strong><sup>88</sup></strong>. Thus the sons of Korah were probably instrumentalists as well as singers

6.	In Psalm <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>3, <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>84</sup></strong>2, <strong><sup>85</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>87</sup></strong>2, and <strong><sup>88</sup></strong>2; but not in Psalm <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>.

H.	<em>Selah</em> appears in 7 of the 15 psalms that say “set to ______.”

1.  In 1 psalm “set to <em>Methlabben</em>” (Psalm <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>);

In 3 of the 4 psalms “set to <em>Altashheth</em>” (Psalm <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>,<strong> 59</strong>, <strong><sup>75</sup></strong>; but not in Psalm <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>);

In the 1 psalm “set to <em>Mahalath Leannoth</em>” (Psalm <strong><sup>88</sup></strong>);

In the 1 psalm “set to <em>Shushan Eduth</em>” (Psalm <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>);

In the 1 psalm “set to <em>Alamoth</em>” (Psalm<strong> 46</strong>).

2.  Not in the 1 psalm “set to <em>Mahalath</em>” (Psalm <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>);

Not in 2 psalms “set to the <em>Sheminith</em>” (Psalm<strong> 6</strong>, 1<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>);

Not in the 1 psalm “set to <em>Aijeleth Hash-Shachar</em>” (Psalm<strong> 22</strong>);

Not in the 3 psalms “set to <em>Shoshannim</em>” (Psalm <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>69</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>80</sup></strong>);

Not in the 1 psalm “set to <em>Jonath Elem Rehokim</em>” (Psalm <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>).

I.	<em>Selah</em> occurs in 20 of the 57 psalms called מִזְמוֹר (root זמר, “to touch, to strike, to play an instrument").

1.  in Psalm <strong>3, 4, 9, 20-21, 24, 39, 47-50, 62, 82- 85, 87-88, 140;</strong>

2.  not in Psalm <strong>5-6, 8, 12-13, 15, 19, 22-23, 29-31, 38, 40-41, 63-68, 73, 75-77, 79-80, 92, 98, 101-102, 108-110, 139, 141</strong>

J.	A summary of observations

1.  Although <em>selah</em> does not always appear in psalms whose titles have some sort of musical element, it never appears in a psalm that lacks some sort of musical element.

2.  It never appears in a psalm that has no title: <strong>1, 2, 10, 33, 43, 71, 72, 90, 91, 93, 97, 99, 104, 105-107, 111-119, 135-137, 146-150.</strong>

3.  It does not appear in the songs of ascents—even though David’s name is attached to <strong><sup>122</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>124</sup></strong>, <strong><sup>131</sup></strong>, and <strong><sup>133</sup></strong>—presumably because the worshipers used them along the way on the pilgrimages to Jerusalem rather than in the temple. Music would be more difficult to supply while traveling.

4.	<em>Selah </em>appears in 6 of the 17 psalms that mention a musical instrument:

harp (כִּנּוֹר, Psalm <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>:4; <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>:4; <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>:8; <strong><sup>71</sup></strong>:22; <strong><sup>81</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>92</sup></strong>:3; <strong><sup>98</sup></strong>:5; <strong><sup>108</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>137</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>147</sup></strong>:7; <strong><sup>149</sup></strong>:3; <strong><sup>150</sup></strong>:3);

instrument (כִּלִי, Psalm<strong> 71</strong>:22);

organ (עוּגָב, Psalm <strong><sup>150</sup></strong>:40);

ten-stringed instrument (עָשׂוֹר, Psalm <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>92</sup></strong>:3);

timbrel תֹּף), Psalm <strong><sup>81</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>149</sup></strong>:3; <strong><sup>150</sup></strong>:4);

timbrel (תֻּפָּף, Psalm <strong><sup>68</sup></strong>:25(;

trumpet (הֲצֹצְרָה, Psalm <strong><sup>98</sup></strong>:6);

trumpet (שׁוֹפָר, Psalm<strong> 47</strong>:5;<strong> 81</strong>:3;<strong> 98</strong>:6; <strong><sup>150</sup></strong>:3);

cymbal (מְצִלְתַּיִם, Psalm <strong><sup>150</sup></strong>:5);

viol (נַבֶל, Psalm<strong> 33</strong>:2; <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>:8; <strong><sup>71</sup></strong>:22;<strong> 81</strong>:2; <strong><sup>92</sup></strong>:3; <strong><sup>108</sup></strong>:9; <strong><sup>144</sup></strong>:9; <strong><sup>150</sup></strong>:3).

So, <em>selah</em> appears with instrument indications in Psalm <strong>47, 49, 57, 68, 81, 87</strong>; but not in Psalm <strong>33, 43, 71, 92, 98, 108, 137, 144, 147, 149, 150</strong>.
