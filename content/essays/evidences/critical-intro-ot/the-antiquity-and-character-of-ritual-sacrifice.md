to the higher critical reconstruction of Hebrew history, ritual sacrifice
developed later than the time of Moses. The prophetic movement, beginning with
Amos, opposed blood sacrifice as an appropriate way to draw near to God. The
reconstruction takes certain statements as reminiscent of this earlier attitude
in Israel and call for examination in light of the Wellhausen claim.</span></p>

to higher critical opinion, Amos’ opposition to feasts, solemn assemblies,
burnt offerings, peace offerings, meal offerings, and songs in Israel’s contemporary
worship was due to (a) their syncretistic nature, (b) their superficial manner,
or (c) the polytheistic character of Israel’s worship. Amos’ objection was not to
sacrifice as such, but to sacrifices invalidated by contextual considerations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            A
more pressing difficulty lies in <b>5</b>:25: <i>“Did you bring me sacrifices
and offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?”</i> The
relevant issues are (a) whether the verse is a statement or a question, (b)
whether the question anticipates a “yes” or “no” answer, and (c) whether the
“no” answer means that they did not sacrifice in the wilderness, or that they
did not sacrifice to <u>Yahveh</u> although they did to other gods, or that
they did not sacrifice to Yahveh exclusively and so not at all, because he
refuses the worship of polytheists.</span></p>

not appear in the text as pointed by the Masoretes. Since the interrogative
particle need not be used and since the Greek Septuagint translates the verse
as a question, the better alternative understands it interrogatively even
though it good sense to say, <i>“Sacrifices and offerings you brought to me in
the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel, but/and/also/yes you

  <i>“Did you sacrifice to me in the wilderness?”</i> could be answered, <i>“Yes,
you did, but they were impure and unacceptable sacrifices (then as they are
now) because they were mixed with the worship of other gods”</i> (Archer, <i>A
Survey of Old Testament Introduction</i>, p. 150).</span></p>

  Luke’s record of Stephen’s speech before the Sanhedrin quotes Amos as
implying a negative answer, thus reinforcing the Septuagint rendering at this
point.</span></p>

me that is not sacrifice to me only is not sacrifice to me at all.”</span></i><span

even in the beginning were the people wholly faithful to Yahveh. <i>“Giving

are several references to Israel’s idolatry during the wilderness wandering: Exodus
<b>4</b>:19; <b>9</b>:6-24; <b>17</b>:2-3 as well as before (Genesis <b>31</b>:30-34;
Joshua <b>24</b>:14).</span></p>

 Stephen understood Amos’ comment as at least applicable to the period of
wilderness wandering. His speech is chronologically arranged so it says nothing
about matters after Solomon’s reign. The verses surrounding the Amos citation
pertain to the forty-year period before the conquest. On his own he affirms
that when the Israelites made the calf, God gave them up to worship the host of
heaven, and says, <i>“ . . . as it is written,”</i> quoting Amos <b>5</b>:25-27.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

beauty of the worship form, either as pleasing to the eye or ear, does not
validate the ritual as worship. It is comparable to a secular choir beautifully
performing Handel’s “Messiah,” though the people do not believe the message in
the libretto. God would be more pleased by less gifted performers who mean what
they sing.</span></p>

in Deuteronomy <b>4</b>:21*; 2 Samuel <b>18</b>:5*, 2 Kings<b> 22</b>:13; Psalm
<b>7</b> (heading); Jeremiah <b>14</b>:21.* In the references with asterisks,
the word shows something of its distinctive flavor: <i>“out of a concern for.”</i>
In derivation the expression indicates <i>“on the words of.”</i> It has
associations then with meaning. This observation brings onto Jeremiah <b>7</b>:22,
the following sense: <i>“I did not give you commandments out of a concern for
getting sacrifices offered to me.” </i>The theology of sacrifice was not a
pagan one in which the sacrifices were for the gods, as Paul indicates in Acts <b>17</b>:25:
people do not serve God as though he needs anything. The Old Testament
sacrifice was for the offerer, either because the death of the animal substituted
for the death of the sinner that offered it or because it expressed love to the
God who gave life and breath and all things, including the offering the
worshiper brought to him. </span></p>

objection to the Israelites’ ritual worship and his refusal to accept it
resulted from the sinfulness of those who in prayer spread out hands to him that
were covered with blood. If Isaiah were objecting to the solemn assemblies as
such, he would be objecting to prayer, which is listed among those acts of
worship that God was refusing. Yahveh, God of Israel, knew hearts, so, unlike
the pagan gods, he would not honor people’s worship whose hearts were not in
harmony with the meaning of the outward ritual (cp. Jeremiah <b>14</b>:10-12; <b>6</b>:18-20).</span></p>

obey is better than sacrifice.”</i> Mark <b>12</b>:33 quotes the prophet Samuel
after Saul’s ill-advised sacrifice. Saul had offered sacrifice in preparation
for battle against the Amalekites. Forcing the sacrifice without Samuel’s
promised presence made it look like faring well in battle resulted automatically
the ritual sacrifice. God honors obedience more than ritual observance.</span></p>

cited in Matthew <b>9</b>:13; <b>12</b>:7, the Hosea statement reinforces the
previous points on the importance of a proper heart over a proper ritual. The
passage illustrates relative negation, where the form of the statement is an
affirmative-negative (<i>“I desire goodness, not sacrifice”</i>; cp. 1
Corinthians <b>1</b>:17) while the meaning is more (<i>“I desire goodness more
than sacrifice”</i>). The parallelism in <b>6</b>:6 bears out that point: <i>“I
desire the knowledge of God <u>more than</u> burnt offerings.” </i>Disinterest
in the form was also not acceptable (Malachi <b>1</b>:6-14; Hosea <b>4</b>:19).</span></p>

life quality takes precedence over impersonal ritual. Jesus speaks when he says
to leave the sacrifice beside the altar, be reconciled to the offended brother,
and then return to offer the gift (Matthew <b>5</b>:23-24). The character of
the worshipers determines the acceptableness of their worship. No matter how
extreme—a thousand rams or the gift of a person’s child—it is not acceptable
unless accompanied by appropriate character.</span></p>

was not pleased by sacrifice <i>per se</i>. To be meaningful, animal sacrifice had
to rest on the prior sacrifice of a contrite heart and a subsequent obedient
life. <i>“Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt

<b>40</b> brings another dimension to sacrifice as Hebrews <b>10</b>:1-12 shows
in citing Psalm <b>40</b>:6-8a. In the previous texts, the sacrifices were not
acceptable because of the way people offered them. In this passage they are not
sufficient because of their nature. The blood of bulls and goats cannot remove
human guilt (Hebrews <b>10</b>:4), presumably because amoral animals are not
appropriate substitutes for moral people. The sacrifices were divinely ordained
as early as the Mosaic legislation and, if properly offered, were valid but not
inherently effective to the saving of people’s souls.</span></p>

.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Several
texts in the Old Testament reflect negatively on the sacrificial system. In the
estimation of many higher critics, (a) Amos and Jeremiah <u>speak against this
institution as such</u> with the implication that ritual sacrifice had no part in
Israel’s national heritage. Other passages (b) <u>speak against this
institution improperly observed</u> with the admonition to change the heart to
validate the ritual (Isaiah, Samuel, Hosea, Micah, and Psalm <b>51</b>). Finally,
Psalm <b>40</b> (c) <u>speaks against that institution as inherently
ineffective</u> for the cleansing of the human conscience from sin. In passages
that call for proper observance, God’s distinct character as holy creator and
heart-knower means, on the one hand, that <u>sacrifice was not for feeding him</u>
and, on the other hand, that <u>he cannot be deceived</u> by (1) the pleasantness
of the form to eye or ear or by (2) the extremeness of the act like rivers of
oil, a thousand rams, or the sacrifice of a person’s own child.</span></p>
