Style includes <b>(a)</b> the variant names of persons, places, and groups. The
variation between divine names has been especially noted: <u>Y</u>ahveh and <u>E</u>lohim.
Other examples include two words for female slave: <i><u>shiphi</u></i> (J) and
<i>’amah</i> (E); for the mountain of God: Sinai (J, P) and Horeb (E, D); for
the pronoun “I”: <i>’ani</i> (P) and <i>’anochi</i> (J-E). A second turn to the
matter of style is <b>(b)</b> flowing narrative (J) <i>versus</i> arid and

Variant views of God correlate with the difference between the names for him. Yahveh

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>1. <u>Biblical
association of Mosaic authorship with Pentateuch materials</u>. The New
Testament references to the Pentateuch with <i>“Moses said” </i>might be
understood in a historical, rather than a literary sense, so the way the text
came to its final form would be left unspecified. Paul and Jesus, however, go
on to speak of Moses as writer of materials they cite: <i>“Moses writes that
the man who does the righteousness that is of the law shall live thereby” </i>(Romans
<b>10</b>:5; Leviticus <b>18</b>:5). Other passages are Mark <b>12</b>:19 (=
Luke <b>20</b>:28), Luke <b>24</b>:27; John<b> 1</b>:45; <b>5</b>:46-47 based
on Deuteronomy <b>18</b>:15, 18. <i>“If you do not believe his </i>[Moses’] <i>writings,
how will you believe what I’m saying?” </i>John <b>5</b>:47 sounds like a
generalized statement regarding Mosaic writings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Readers expect Jesus
to mean by these writings what the Jews understood as Moses’ work since he does
not explain the reference or object to their identifying Moses with the
Pentateuch. Jesus addressed people who had no better way than we do to
distinguish between parts written by Moses and parts written by someone else. He
would, then, be assuming with them a common understanding of such matters. Beginning
with New Testament delimitations requires rejecting the documentary hypothesis,
because there is no way to attribute Mosaic authorship to the Pentateuch
materials under such a scheme. Furthermore, the motive behind such criticism is
to take the Pentateuch from his hand and put it much later. There is no way to
imagine a reliable body of literature that came together under the
circumstances and in the manner that documentarians propose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Pentateuch
itself speaks of God’s commanding Moses to write and of his putting the
commandments of Yahveh in a book: Exodus<b> 17</b>:14; <b>24</b>:4; <b>34</b>:27-28;
Deuteronomy <b>31</b>:9, 19, 22, 24. When we begins with the claim of the text,
it does not allow for the manner of origination involved in the typical
formulation of JEDP, and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>2. <u>Circularity
of procedure</u>. The kind of material chosen for a document affects style and
vocabulary, because content determines these matters. Notably in the case of P
the “arid and precise” manner of presentation comes from the nature of legal
materials. Furthermore, the “precise and structural” idea is about the only
reason for assigning a section like Genesis <b>1</b> to the P source.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>      With J and
E, the choice of the names correlates with the content. “Yahveh” appears in the
interpersonal/covenantal sections and lends itself to anthropomorphisms; “Yahveh”
appears where imminence is involved; “Elohim,” based on power, appears where
transcendence and sovereignty predominate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>      Documentary
criticism relies heavily on the concurrence of phenomena instead of any one
criterion. Its appeals to multiple names for God in other literature do not
receive proper weight since the correlation of criteria in biblical materials
supposedly override such observations. But the correlation of criteria is not
neat and complete. Instead of viewing this as evidence against the original hypothesis,
critics postulate redactors as a mechanism for “mixing” the phenomena across
documents. Evidence does not become decisive under these circumstances. Rather,
the conclusion is assumed in the process of formulating the argument and
organizing the data, so the criteria are not arguments for the conclusion. At
best they could represent attempts at maintaining consistency. We have argued
above that they do not even accomplish consistency as measured by other Near
Eastern literary examples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>3. <u>Obliviousness
to Near Eastern scribal practices</u>. Even if the documentary theory were
consistent with the internal data, it would not accord well with other Near
Eastern literature. Parallelism, parataxis, repetition, and multiple names
characterize Semitic style as monument inscriptions demonstrate. Scholars
formulated source critical theory in the 1700s in a relative vacuum of Near
Eastern literature. Subsequent archaeological discoveries do not confirm their
assumptions, yet critics retain the theory despite an artificialness that
deviates from occidental literary practice.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>4. <u>Claim of
being scientific while not subject to falsification</u>. We suspect that using the
label “scientific criticism” tries to give respectability to what is artificial,
contrived, and inappropriate. A procedure is not scientific if it is not
subject to verification and falsification. Such literary critical methods can
never come under objective criticism, because critics can postulate another
redactor or another source to cover the stray data that do not fit the scheme
as it now stands. The problem comes from needing to provide <u>adequate</u>,  <u>positive</u>,
<u>objective</u> evidence for the idea in the first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>5. <u>Creation of
further difficulties</u>. After parceling up the text into sources, an
interpreter cannot use information in one source to contextualize information
in another. By decontextualizing the phenomena, the documentary theory creates
contradictions would not otherwise existent in the whole. For example, the
order of creation in Genesis<b> 2</b> supposedly contradicts the order in
Genesis <b>1</b>. But if we accept the unified literary structure of these
chapters, we understand Genesis <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> as different topical
arrangements, and feel no urge to “explain” the man before the plants and
animals in Genesis<b> 2</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another resulting difficulty
is the supposed historical framework in which this parceled-up literature came
to exist. Having destroyed by division the natural history of Israel that gave
it order and sequence, a source critic has to provide another one. With the
historical structure gone, a philosophical one substitutes for it. The theory
of evolution, or unilinear progressivism, substitutes on the assumption that
relative progress in time correlates with relative progress in refining ideas. A
critic goes through the Pentateuch and the rest of the Old and New Testaments
and lays out the portions in terms on the relatively advanced nature of the
concepts. In this way critics construct a pseudo-history. They can qualify the
attempt to tie in the advancing of religious ideas with contacts between Israel
and the Egyptians, Canaanites, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, and so on. It stays
in the naturalistic and evolutionary framework for its presuppositional base. Archaeological
discoveries come into the picture to flesh out the theoretical understanding. Cultural
contact supplemented by dynamic inspiration substitutes for the revelation the
text claims for itself throughout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>6. <u>Literary
base</u>. Documentary theories are constructs that tie to literary
considerations, but they do not take all literary considerations into account. If
divine names serve as criteria for sources, a critic risks assuming that the
Masoretic text preserves the original reading. A significant number of cases exist
when the LXX reads differently on whether <i>Yahveh</i> or <i>Elohim</i> stood
in the text from which the Septuagint translators worked a couple hundred years
B.C.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>7. <u>Alternative
analysis more in keeping with the data</u>. Genesis <b>1</b> and<b> 2</b>
affords the most plausible evidence for the documentary theory, and it was
probably what suggested the idea and prompted a search for additional examples.
The alternate analysis for these chapters notes that the first represents a more
complete topical origination of the universe and world from an omniscient and
geocentric viewpoint while the second gives a more restricted topical treatment
organized around mankind, the crowning piece of creation (anthropocentric
viewpoint). Genesis <b>2</b> deals exclusively with human work of cultivating
plant life and with being distinct from the animals. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Chapter <b>2 </b>does
not mention aspects in the broader picture: sun, moon, and stars; light and
darkness, bases for the cycles of time, dry land and ocean, fish in the sea;
and the creeping, crawling things that were too different from humans to
warrant comment or concern for keeping them distinct. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Chapter <b>2 </b>adds
details about the man-woman, husband-wife relationship in humankind
(internally) whereas chapter <b>1 </b>presents humankind (externally) in
relation to the creator (<i>imago dei</i>) and the surrounding creation (the
dominion mandate). Chapter <b>2</b> adds the weather feature that the first
chapter omits (rain) in keeping with its notation about mankind cultivating the
ground for producing food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><i><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> is the name used
in chapter <b>1</b>, because it treats topics that associate with God’s sovereignty
and power; the root idea in Elohim is power. <i>Yahveh</i> occurs in chapter <b>2</b>
because relational concerns dominate. The covenant name for God connects with
marriage and human distinction from the animal kingdom. The ordered style comes
from presenting a more complete picture of origins. The more flowing style fits
with the relational nature of mankind and the world in the second statement</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>8. <u>Motivation
from which documentary criticism arose</u>. Historically, documentary theories derive
with skepticism, deism, rationalism, antisupernaturalism, and other forms of
disbelief. The purpose of negative literary criticism has been to provide an
alternative to the claims of Old Testament texts themselves. If an alternative
formulation can present a scholarly-looking expression, disbelief seems more
justified. Scholars do things with biblical materials that would seem pointless
elsewhere. Where else does such literary analysis happen? The critical analysis
reflects the disbelief in its originators</span></p>

elaboration in Genesis <b>2</b> of its related humanity materials in Genesis <b>1</b>
anticipates another elaboration in Genesis <b>3</b> of the humankind material
in Genesis <b>2</b>. In <b>2</b>:5 the text speaks of mankind as not yet
present to cultivate the ground. <i>“Serving the ground”</i> leaps over the
scenario in Genesis<b> 3</b> about the Orchard full of trees, the forbidden
tree whose fruit Adam and Eve ate anyway, which in turn brings in death (19b),
pain in childbirth (16), and <i>“serving the ground”</i> (17-19a). In further
elaboration, the account about two sons of Adam and Eve brings the created world
into another degree of deterioration when Cain kills Abel. That brings in the
enmity between people (internally) that carries forward the enmity between
people and Satan (externally, <b>3</b>:15); it also introduces ground <i>“that
will no longer yield its strength to you.” </i>This whole pattern of enmity
between people and between people and God finally leads to the destruction of
the world by Noah’s flood (Genesis <b>6-7</b>), after which God starts over
with what amounts to the middle of Day 6 in Genesis <b>1</b>. </span></p>

If we accept the idea of R. K. Harrison and others that the structure of
Genesis is indicated by the recurrent expression <i>“these are the begettings
of,”</i> we find the JEPD documentary scheme out of phase with it. For a
description of the system, see Harrison’s <i>Introduction to the Old Testament</i>,
p. 542ff.</span></p>
