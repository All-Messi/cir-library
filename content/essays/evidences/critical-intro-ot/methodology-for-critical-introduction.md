<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For
Christians, critical introduction to the Old Testament has the advantage of
inspired external evidence to confirm and complement the internal evidence for
authorship, date, and character of the earlier literary works. That approach
represents logical order, not necessarily chronological order. The Christian method
<b>(1)</b> begins with the New Testament verdict of Christ and the apostles
insofar as they speak on critical Old Testament issues and <b>(2)</b> examines
the data in those books to see whether they fit the verdict. Lastly, the method
<b>(3)</b> crosschecks each book with information available from archaeology
and ancient Near Eastern literature. The New Testament sets the framework for
any view of the character and manner of origin for the Jewish canon. Tshe
procedure could begin with the claims in the Old Testament books and measure
the contents against the claims. In fact, that is what critics do with any
book, but they would not be doing it as Christians. Critics do not have to do
it necessarily as Christians, but Christians can take advantage of a factor
already in place for clarifying and confirming matters where it can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Correlation</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
and <u>consistency</u> are two tests of truth. Correlation connects a viewpoint
with outside data that may verify or falsify it. Consistency tests whether the
elements in that viewpoint fit with each other. In our case, we approach Old
Testament criticism with a prior commitment to Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah,
not only as Savior but as Lord. Our knowledge of who he is, of what he has done
for us, and what he requires of us comes from the Christian canon. To assume commitment
to him implies submitting to the New Testament scriptures as his word to us; it
submits to the ones he authorized to declare his message, spoken or written. The
New Testament serves as the functional equivalent of the apostles Jesus
appointed and his disciples submit to. So we study the subject while standing
“within the circle.” For <u>consistency’s</u> sake, that allegiance commits us
to the attitudes that he and his apostles took on matters of Old Testament
introduction. Critical introduction to the New Testament precedes critical
introduction to the Old; the two disciplines constitute one system. We cannot
take a high view of Christ without taking a high view of the New Testament we
depend on for knowing about him, and we cannot take a high view of the New
Testament without taking the high view it presents of the Law, the Prophets,
and the Writings. The pattern observes the <u>use</u> the New Testament makes of
the Old, which determines some things about the <u>nature</u> of the Old and its
origin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Highlighting
consistency means giving priority to <u>theory</u> rather than <u>phenomena</u>
in Pentateuchal criticism, <i>etc</i>. Since ideas are clearest in contrast to
parallel alternatives, what theory means we see more clearly in contrast to the
phenomenological method. Instead of starting with an authoritative verdict or
the claim of individual writers, the phenomenological method begins with raw
data to determine “from scratch” the nature of the writings and to reconstruct
the process that brought them into their present form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Because
critical introduction is a historical matter, however, that “scientific”
approach has limitations, because the available data is often too scanty to
generate conclusions. So, assumptions come into play, or the effort cannot
determine much. Those assumptions may derive from progressivism, empiricism,
Religionsgeschichte, evolution, and so on. Supposedly self-evident first
principles fill the same slot that the authority of Jesus, the apostles, and
the New Testament occupy. Several possibilities might derive from that
phenomenological approach, and critics might choose what seems best because they
have no pre-determined place to come out. The phenomenological method dissolves
into a theoretical method because a new authority (the critics’
presuppositions) takes over as the foundation for inquiry. The issue has to do
with authority. For Christians, that authority comes from the commitment that
makes them Christians, and the issues of Old Testament criticism and obedience
to Christ stand or fall together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Theory
and phenomena represent <u>deductive</u> and <u>inductive</u> inquiries. In
critical introduction, the theoretical, deductive approach is restrictive; it
reduces the number of explanations for the literary phenomena in Genesis
through Malachi. Within these delimitations, a Christian is free to postulate,
and hold as opinion, the understandings that best clarify the origin of God’s
word through the prophets of old. For that reason, various views appear among
critics who operate in the evangelical framework.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
consistent-theoretical-deductive-restrictive method differs from circular
reasoning. Though we initially adopt the New Testament’s attitude toward the
Law, we might find in the second and third steps of our work that the phenomena
in the Law do not accommodate that viewpoint. We could then reject both the Law
and the New Testament insofar as they deal with critical issues, and proceed to
work out our own viewpoint. Meantime, we would adjust downward either our view
of the New Testament as itself an inspired record of Messianic and apostolic
claims or our understanding of the deity of Jesus himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Because
of their method advocated here, evangelicals expend a great deal of time,
energy, and resources in defensive pursuits. Their task includes exposing the weaknesses
and fallacies of alternate views, pointing out how to solve supposed
contradictions, demonstrating the superiorities of their approach, and so
forth. Difficulties destroy the phenomenological method because the conclusions
must use the data as evidence, difficulties and all. The evangelical method takes
a position that comes from elsewhere, and holds difficulties in abeyance until
further light removes them as it has frequently done in the past.</span></p>
