<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Science has three major limitations. First,
<b>(1)</b> <u>science cannot deal with universals</u>, or absolutes. It is
subject to “the plague of particularity” because it is limited to the inductive
approach. Science can form and test hypotheses, which are mental deductions
from previous particulars; but these hypotheses are approximate, since they are
based on limited previous experience. Since science cannot deal with the
absolutes of universal space or eternal time, science cannot lead to an
adequate understanding of “the big picture.” In short, science cannot produce a
worldview. It deals more with particulars than with systematics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The second limitation is that <b>(2)</b> <u>science
cannot deal with history</u> strictly speaking because it can deal only with <u>recurring
processes</u>. At best, science can extrapolate backwards into the past
(including cosmogony) and forward into the future (eschatology) on the
assumption of <u>uniformitarianism</u>. The uniformitarian assumption is that
the same <u>set of factors</u> has always and everywhere been operative (at
least potentially so) although the <u>rate</u> of these processes may vary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Thirdly, <b>(3)</b> <u>science cannot deal
with what lies beyond the space-time “material” universe</u>. It can deal only
with <u>natural processes</u>. Science, then, is in no place to pronounce
denials on the existence of arenas outside the realm it can investigate.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Christian epistemology</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christianity does not deal with the
metaphysical realm or even the real, spiritual realm directly. With their
physical senses—extended and intensified by instrumentation, people can come to
know what lies beyond the natural realm by intervention of the supernatural
into the natural. Intervention makes the supernatural able to be experienced
indirectly and approximately in the natural. Intervention can occur in a way that
is visible; visible intervention into the natural realm is called “miracle,” a
form of “manifestation.” Miracle produces results that natural processes do not
produce. The issue is <u>how</u> the effect is produced, not <u>what</u> effect
is produced. The same effect may come by natural or supernatural means.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:7 Paul
parenthetically makes an important statement about living that has far-reaching
implications for how we know: <i>“We walk by faith, not by sight.”</i> “Walking”
refers to the conduct of life. Since conducting life depends on knowing how to
conduct life, Paul implies something about how we know how to live. We come to
know that by faith more than by sight. <u>Faith/trust/belief</u> involves a <u>second
person</u> who stands in the gap between the <u>ignorant first person</u> and
the <u>thing to be known</u> (epistemology), even as a <u>second person</u>
stands in the gap between the <u>dependent first person in need</u> and the <u>result
bestowed</u> (salvation). “Sight” is evidently Paul’s word for direct
experience; so “faith” is his word for the alternative to direct experience, alternatives
channeled through other persons. This category includes indirect experience of
the experienceable and revelation about the unexperienceable supernatural. In
general, we know through other persons (faith) what we cannot know by personal
experience (sight)—including sensory perception.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some things we can know by trusting other
people or by our own direct sight, but the practical limitations of time and
space mean that, in fact, we know even most natural things by trust in
testimony rather than direct experience. We know them interpersonally rather
than scientifically. Some things cannot even be known by direct sight—the
supernatural as well as the universals of time and space within the natural.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            So, faith does not contrast with
knowledge, but with sight. Faith and sight are two ways to obtain knowledge. Sight
is direct experience through the senses, and faith is indirect experience through
the testimony of persons. The popular approach equates knowledge and certainty
with science, on the one hand, and religion with faith and uncertainty, on the
other. That arrangement creates the notion that science is certain and religion
is uncertain; science is objective and religion subjective; science is rational
and religion is affective. That approach does not represent the real situation
either for science or religion, because most of what scientists know they have
not directly experienced or personally verified, and much of what religion
deals with applies to objective existence.</span></p>
