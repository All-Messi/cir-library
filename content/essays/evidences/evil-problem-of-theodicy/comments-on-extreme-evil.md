<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> Although the problem of evil is not “easy” to answer,
we can understand some things about how a degree of evil could occur in a holy
God’s universe. But why an all-powerful God allows extreme evil to happen is
more difficult. Scripture itself does not explain why he lets evil operate to
the degree it does. Nevertheless, some observations make the issue more
understandable.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. Most importantly, whatever the
reason(s), <u>God does not place himself above the horrors of human suffering</u>.
It is beyond us how he can stand by and let atrocities take place before his
very eyes when he could do something to stop them. We must remember, however,
that the Father has not only stood by and let evil people mistreat other evil
people and even abuse good people; he stood by and let sinful men crucify his
own Son. No wonder Jesus cried out, <i>“Why have you forsaken me?”</i> (Matthew
<b>27</b>:46; <i>etc</i>., cp. Psalm <b>22</b>:1). The human perspective of the
dying divine Son is graphically evident in that “cry of dereliction.” That
situation is even more difficult when he lets good men do evil, thinking they
were doing him service (John <b>16</b>:2). The crucifixion of Messiah involves
both the Father standing by and the Son standing in the pain (John <b>18</b>:6,
<i>etc</i>.)—even though Jesus could have called twelve legions of angels to
deliver him (Matthew <b>26</b>:53). Whatever the reason, it is significant
enough that deity went through it himself, not asking us to endure anything he
was unwilling to suffer. Deity does not play favorites with his own, not even
with his own Son, not even with himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. Although we may not understand the
rationale for it, we do observe that <u>even in cases of extreme evil God is
limiting it</u>. Extreme as it sometimes is, it could be worse. The limit on
extreme evil is illustrated in the fact that people pass out when pain becomes
too intense. Death may come as divine relief from human suffering. The
expression of evil is limited both in degree and length. It tends to hold true
that the greater the evil the more short-lived it is. Not only does evil tend
to self-destruct, but the rate of its self-destruction is proportionate to its
degree. Evil’s self-destruction correlates with how contrary it is to good—to
what is truly natural. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3. <u>The more extreme the evil the more
obvious its contrast to good</u>. The more evil is allowed to display itself,
the more it shows itself for what it is. The greater the evil the more likely we
are to reach out for God. The practical fact is that evil prepares the heart
for realistically hearing the good news. In no uncertain terms, evil forces us
to look beyond the physical, temporal realm. It forces us to acknowledge the
need for a benevolent supreme power. Consequently, evil increases the
likelihood of our accepting the good news that fellowship with a good God is
possible through Christ. Extreme evil increases that likelihood.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            4. At least in the case of the righteous, <u>the
more extreme the suffering the greater the potential for character development</u>.
Virtues like steadfastness and self-control are harder to develop in benevolent
circumstances. Evil is not necessary for the definition or development of good,
but its presence highlights and enhances the practice of righteousness. The
more extreme the evil is, the more pronounced may be the righteousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            5. <u>Eternal punishment is commensurate
with earthly sin</u>. Punishment is proportionate to the degree of evil. “Punishment
is commensurate with the crime.” Extreme evil does not “get by” with anything
because final judgment eventually pronounces the greater punishment it
deserves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            6. Finally, <u>the greater the evil the
greater the glory of God</u>. Evil can never win; the harder it tries the
greater it fails. The more people are good the more they glorify God by being
like him. The more people are evil the more they glorify God by contrast. The
more people are evil the more he is glorified in his final triumph over them. Satan
and his evil minions are in an inescapable no-win situation.</span></p>
