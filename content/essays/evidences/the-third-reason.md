<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Belief in the resurrection does not wholly
depend on the evidence for one unique event. That event ties into other matters
that anticipated it in prophecy and issued from it in history. To a significant
extent, accepting Jesus as Messiah depended on the Jews’ proper understanding
of Old Testament anticipations for the Messiah. This web of evidence increases
exponentially the power of the data. A different understanding of Messiah and
his kingdom, however, predisposed most patriotic Jews to reject him on
doctrinal grounds. Nevertheless, as Gamaliel’s presentation shows in Acts <b>5</b>,
the argument from the very existence of the church tended to short-circuit that
doctrinal objection sufficiently to force a re-evaluation of prophetic
interpretation and current policy toward Jesus’ disciples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Arguing from the empty tomb and the
appearances of the resurrected Jesus depends on the reliability of the records.
The argument from the existence of the church, however, more loosely depends on
the New Testament accounts; the historical details would not have to be
accurate in every respect for the argument to have force. Even a cursory
reading of the New Testament shows that the early Christians staked the claim
of the church on whether Jesus came forth alive from his tomb in Jerusalem after
he had been crucified (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:14; cp. 1 Thessalonians<b> 4</b>:14).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Fundamental Proposition</u>: A
person-centered system disintegrates at the death of the central person. The
resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth plausibly explains the continuation of his
movement after his death (Acts<b> 5</b>:34-42).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        When Jewish authorities
arrested the apostles and were of a mind to execute them for preaching Jesus as
Messiah, Gamaliel restrained the Sanhedrin by observing that this movement was
not following the pattern of false Messianic movements. In the cases of Judas
and Theudas, the natural consequence came about: the death of the leader led to
the disintegration of his movement. In the case of Jesus, his death not only
failed to stop the movement; the movement gained impetus afterwards. His
resurrection could explain this unexpected pattern, and so the council heeded
Gamaliel’s advice to <i>“let them alone”</i> and to <i>“let them go for a
little while.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        We must enter the contemporary
Jewish mind-set to sense the power of Gamaliel’s argument. Instead of supposing
that this doctor of the law simply used the occasion to score a point against
the Sadducees in the council (a secondary motivation, perhaps), we propose that
his argument had enough cogency in the context that it relaxed the persecution
sufficiently to multiply disciples in Jerusalem and convert a great number of
priests (Acts <b>6</b>:7). Only after an indeterminate period of time, did Gamaliel’s
student, Saul of Tarsus, initiate a wave of persecution beginning with the
martyrdom of Stephen that lasted until Saul himself was converted in Damascus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            I. The first element in the picture is
that <u>Messiah is eternal</u>. During the ministry of Jesus this idea surfaced
as one “stumbling block” for the multitude when Jesus publicly intimated that he
would die by crucifixion (John <b>12</b>:34; Matthew <b>26</b>:35). Out of the
law the people had learned that Messiah was to abide forever. Typical passages
include Daniel <b>7</b>:14; Isaiah<b> 9</b>:7; Ezekiel <b>37</b>:25; and Psalm <b>110</b>:4.
Since there can be only one universal eternal kingdom (as per Daniel <b>7</b>:13-14;
Psalm <b>89</b>), any prophetic passage dealing with either a universal or
eternal kingdom would likely refer to the Messiah and his kingdom. Especially
under the pressure of Roman domination, the Jewish mind had fixed on permanent liberation
and salvation. For a Messiah to claim that he would die was doubly unthinkable:
the prophets had said he would abide forever, and the people needed him to
deliver them permanently from political oppression. Jews would not follow a
Hebrew Messiah they knew was dead. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Not only did the masses
subscribe to this understanding, but the inner circle of Jesus’ disciples
assumed it. At his disclosure that he would have to go to Jerusalem, suffer,
and die, Peter promptly took him aside and rebuked him, not seeming to hear the
further comments that death would not prevail against establishing the kingdom
because he would arise the third day (Matthew <b>16</b>:13-28). Before the
resurrection the disciples followed the expected pattern of fear (John <b>20</b>:19)
and dispersal that later turned to atypical boldness and power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        For the Jewish leaders, there
was one practical consequence of the Messiah’s eternality: the very fact that
they could kill him meant he was not the Messiah. The incredible behavior of the
passersby, the soldiers, the rulers of the people, and even those who died with
him takes on at least a modicum of reason with this observation (Matthew <b>27</b>:29-44;
Mark <b>15</b>:29-32; Luke<b> 23</b>:35-37). Before his crucifixion the two
Emmaus residents <i>“had hoped that he was the one that would redeem Israel”</i>
(Luke<b> 24</b>:21). Now that he was dead, the chief priests could confidently
call him “that deceiver” (Matthew <b>27</b>:63). He did not abide forever; he
was not the Messiah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            II. The second element in the picture is
that <u>the Messianic kingdom is a person-centered system</u>. By virtue of
eternality, Messiah’s kingdom accentuates the person-centered character of the
normal kingdom model; here the same person—not just his dynasty—would be king
forever. As a result, there exists no real parallel to the Messiah and his
kingdom. Naturally, a person-centered system disintegrates when the personal
center is removed. It is this point that Gamaliel makes when he contrasts the
present case to previous ones that had followed the pattern natural to
Messianism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        A. What is affirmed here differs
from an <u>ideology-centered system</u>. Communism did not die with the death
of Karl Marx. The movement of a charismatic leader will sometimes disintegrate
with his death even though the movement is an ideology-centered one. A case in
point is Adolf Hitler and his doctrine of the supremacy of the “Aryan” race. The
cause lost an articulate and forceful leader and for that and other reasons
fell apart, but it did not in the nature of things have to do so. An ideology
does not depend on a person for its existence, because the concept may move to
to someone else and continue to operate. If the ideology is somehow proved
false scientifically, historically, or philosophically, the movement centered
around it likewise dissolves. An ideology-centered movement dies when its
ideological center “dies” in the same way that a person-centered one dies if
its person dies. The Christ was not the dead founder of a religious movement;
he is the living Lord of an eternal kingdom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        B. What is affirmed here must
also differs from <u>sin’s tendency to self-destruct</u>. Sin does tend to
self-destruct because it is out of keeping with the nature of the situation;
when the entity conducts itself contrary to its nature, natural selection
removes it from the competition. Sin’s self-destruction may involve generations
whereas the subject in Gamaliel’s speech is “a little while.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        C. Later, during the preaching
about the resurrection, these men had their lives endangered, they were beaten,
many were killed. Had their claims for Jesus’ resurrection been false, they
would surely not have died for a (1) known (2) falsehood that was (3) contrary
to their convictions as Jews.            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        D. From an ethical standpoint,
a person finds it difficult to believe that so high a moral standard as the
believers advocated (and demonstrated in many other particulars) would allow
for perpetrating such a fraud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    When the rabbi
affirmed, <i>“if this counsel is from people, it will be overthrown,”</i> he
did not mean it as a universal principle in history, but as a principle
applicable to the particular matter at hand: the concept of Messiah and his
kingdom during Roman domination. That Jesus had resurrected, Gamaliel could accept
in principle since he was a Pharisee. Besides, Jesus’ resurrection not only (1)
explained the peculiarity of the case, but it also (2) provided a way of
joining together the suffering and glory motifs in Old Testament prophecy. It
(3) tied in with Jesus’ prediction of his resurrection and (4) fit with his
miraculous ministry, especially the raising of Lazarus (John <b>11</b>:1-53),
which had been a particularly embarrassing sign performed right “under the
rulers’ noses.” The resurrection (5) accounted for the disappearance of Jesus’
body and (6) made sense of the disciples’ indomitable spirit. It likewise (7)
was consonant with continued miracles like that of healing the well-known lame
man at Gate Beautiful (Acts <b>3-4</b>). The cumulative force of these
considerations made Gamaliel’s caution a wise one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. <u>Political</u>. <i>“It came to nothing”</i>
means that (1) the Romans will take care of this as they did Theudas and Judas;
we need not get involved. (2) <i>“Minded to execute them”</i> relates to the
fact that Rome had withdrawn the Jewish right to exercise capital punishment
(except when the temple precincts were being desecrated). Gamaliel’s suggestion
kept them from ill-advised action that could bring worse trouble on the
religious leaders than Jesus’ Messianic movement was bringing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. <u>Theological</u>. The Pharisee
Gamaliel is willing to use this observation to score a point against the
Sadducees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3. <u>Practical</u>. You have to admit
that the resurrection the disciples were proclaiming would explain the
different direction this Messianic movement was taking after its leader’s death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The existence of the church and the fact that
Jesus resurrected stand or fall together. The church would not have come into
existence without Messiah’s resurrection; the church exists; so the
resurrection must have occurred as claimed. Resurrection is the kind of event
that does not happen without supernatural agency and therefore divine approval
of Jesus as what he claimed to be: <i>“dead men don’t resurrect.”</i> The
resurrection powerfully declared Jesus of Nazareth to be the Son of God (Romans
<b>1</b>:1-4). Consequently, the church legitimately exists, which says that we
can legitimately accept Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah, Son of the living God. </span></p>
