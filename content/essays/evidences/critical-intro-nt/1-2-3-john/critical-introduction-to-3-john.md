<p style='text-align:justify'> I. Authorship</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It is uncertain whether there is any evidence for
3 John ‘s being cited before the third century, if the Muratorian Canon speaks
only of two epistles of John. This lack of citation and mention is
understandable because of its brevity and the character of its contents. What
was said of “the Elder” in connection with 1 John applies here also.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>II. Destination</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>Beloved “Gaius” is unlikely to be one of the
Gaiuses mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament since the name was common. The
destination is probably an Asiatic church since the letter is similar to 2 John
in its warnings against similar false teaching.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'> III. Date of Writing</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>There is little to establish a date except the
lifetime of John the apostle, although it is usually thought by conservatives
that 2 and 3 John were written at nearly the same time for similar reasons.</p>
