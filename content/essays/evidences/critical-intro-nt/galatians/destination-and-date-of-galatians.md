style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The main introductory problems
associated with Galatians are its destination and date. Determining the
destination affects the time frame for the date. Since the readers are called “Galatians”
(<b>3</b>:1; cp.<b> 1</b>:2), the question is whether Paul uses the term to
mean (1) the ethnic group of Gauls, who gave their name to the ancient
Hellenistic kingdom, or (2) the citizens of the Roman province of Galatia. The “northern
Galatia” theory refers to the first option; the “southern Galatia” theory indicates
the second. By that time the Roman province extended farther south to include
Lystra, Derbe, and Iconium, cities Paul and Barnabas evangelized on the first
missionary tour. Northern Galatia was a less extensive territory in the
mountainous inland area around Pessinus and Ancyra. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Α</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>.  Acts records
the evangelization of cities only in south Galatia. We would assume that Luke’s
choice of materials would provide a background for literary activity during
that period because he had the vantage point of time by which to assess what
turned out to be important. As Paul’s personal physician, Luke may have been
with him more than some in the Pauline circle. So he is a candidate for compiling
the Pauline corpus, an idea that reinforces the importance of the events he chose
to include in Acts. Acts otherwise serves as a framework for Paul’s life up to
the end of the first Roman imprisonment. Except for Colossae, Acts recounts the
establishment of all the churches Paul wrote to. So, presumption favors Lystra,
Derbe, and Iconium as among the churches Paul reprimands in this letter. Acts
says nothing about Paul’s traveling to more northern reaches. In fact, it is
hard to find a place to insert such an endeavor unless it occurred during the
Ephesian ministry. Even there it seems doubtful since he (probably) had not
personally founded the Colossian church, which would have been on his way to
north Galatia from Ephesus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Β</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>.  No clear
record of early Christianity exists for the more northern territory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  C.  Paul mentions Barnabas in<b> 2</b>:13
presumably because the readers knew him. He was with Paul when he established
the southern Galatian churches. It is of note that Paul mentions Barnabas in
Colossians <b>4</b>:10 also even though we have no reason to believe that he directly
took part in founding that church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  D.  Even the few significant cities
in the north—Pessinus, Tavium, Ancyra—do not match the criteria Paul used in
founding churches: Roman cities on trade routes where Greek culture and Jewish
influence existed. These northern Galatian cities were off the beaten track of
east-west commerce. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  E.   In his account of Paul’s
movement, Luke customarily uses the Roman provincial terms instead of the
Hellenistic kingdom terminology (<b>20</b>:4; <b>27</b>:2); he may reflect Paul’s
custom in that regard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  F.   Acts <b>20</b>:4 mentions two
representatives from south Galatia who accompanied their churches’ gift to the
poor saints in Jerusalem (cp. 1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:3), but none are listed
from north Galatia. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  G.  Paul says “we” in Galatians <b>1</b>:8-9
when he speaks of first preaching to the Galatians, which could include
Barnabas; later in <b>4</b>:12, where he refers to the division between himself
and the Galatians, he says “I,” which would then put Barnabas on their side
because his dissimulation in Antioch typified the Galatian heresy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  H.  Paul views the Galatians as
fickle. Acts illustrates such a thing in the people of Lystra, who
enthusiastically welcomed Paul and even attempted to offer sacrifice to him
only to turn on him later and stone him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I.          Incidental notices occur between the Acts
account and the Galatian epistle. The people of Lystra received Paul and
Barnabas as gods that had come down in the likeness of humans (Acts <b>14</b>:11).
Galatians says that they received him like an angel of God (<b>4</b>:4). Paul’s
references to the temptations in the flesh and the marks of the Lord Jesus
branded in his body (Galatians <b>4</b>:14; <b>6</b>:17) find illustration in
the persecutions and sufferings that came to him in Antioch, Lystra, and
Iconium (2 Timothy <b>3</b>:11), especially the stoning at Lystra (Acts <b>14</b>:19).
The progress of Judaizing tendencies among the Galatians corresponds with the
presence of a large Jewish element such as Luke’s history describes in the
churches of Lycaonia and Pisidia (Acts <b>13</b>:14, 43, 45; <b>14</b>:1; 1<b>6</b>:3).
Paul’s impatient epistle becomes natural since he had not preached to them a
legalistic gospel. (This last point might fit as well if the letter from
Jerusalem had already been distributed among them on the second missionary
tour: Acts<b> 16</b>:4.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The date and destination correlate. Evidence
favoring an early date requires a southern destination, because Paul could not
have evangelized in northern Galatia prior to the Ephesian mission on the third
tour. A northern Galatian destination requires a late date; a southern
destination could be early or late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Three approximate dates have been

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        1.   The Judaizing heresy began
early on. Romans in the mid-50s deals with the same issue and so does Ephesians
even later during the first Roman imprisonment. The Conference on Circumcision
(Acts <b>15</b>:1-35; <b>16</b>:4) may have had a staying effect on the
Judaizing mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        2.   In <b>1</b>:6 Paul is
amazed that his readers are so “soon” or “quickly” (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ταχέως</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>) removed
to another gospel. The uncertainty is whether he means soon from the time of
their original conversion (hence, early date) or soon from the time of their
exposure to the Judaizers’ message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        3.   We know about the
southern Galatian mission from the Book of Acts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        4.   Paul would have mentioned
the Jerusalem decree if the conference on circumcision had occurred before the
writing of Galatians (hence, <u>before the conference</u>). It is conceivable, though
that he may not have wanted to compromise his own primary apostolic authority,
which he is clearly concerned to maintain in Galatians. He may have thought
also that by not referring to it he was eventually giving the Galatians two
independent sources against the Judaizing message—one from him and another from
the conference decree that they would receive later. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        5.   Peter and Barnabas’
dissimulation would have been incredible after the conference (hence, <u>before
the conference</u>). But that may have been the reason Paul was so “straight”
with Peter when it happened. We should not underestimate the power of social
pressure on lifelong prejudices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        6.   Paul would not have
needed to write a letter if copies of the Jerusalem decree had already been
distributed (hence, <u>before the second tour</u> or at least before the “Galatians”
had received such letters—northern Galatians would not have received them).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        7.   If Galatians <b>2</b>:1-10
equals the conference of Acts <b>15</b>, then Galatians would be <u>after the
conference</u> and Peter’s dissimulation but perhaps <u>before the second tour</u>
since he does not mention the decrees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  B.  Arguments favoring a <u>late
date</u></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        1.   Galatians <b>1</b>:18 and
<b>2</b>:1 mention three years after Paul’s conversion and then fourteen years.
Adding three and fourteen—rather than including the three in the fourteen—seems
more natural to an English reader. A date prior to the second tour would
require too early a date for the death of Stephen and the conversion of Paul
(A.D. 49 minus 17 equals A.D. 32). Including the three within the fourteen
would yield a date around A.D. 35 for Stephen’s death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        2.   <i>“The first time”</i> (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>πρότερον</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>,
former time; <b>4</b>:13) is said to imply at least two times when Paul had
preached to the Galatians (hence, <u>after the southern Galatian segment of the
second tour</u>). That inference probably pushes the precision in the wording
too far (cp. Acts <b>1</b>:1). Galatians itself could be the second “preaching
of the gospel” to the readers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        3.   More resemblances of
thought exist between Galatians and 2 Corinthians than between any other two
epistles of Paul except Ephesians and Colossians, which were written at nearly
the same time. If Galatians is placed <u>between the time of writing 2
Corinthians and Romans</u>, Galatians would be like Romans in the rough. The
Galatians-2 Corinthians parallels include the following: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              (a) The incestuous
person at Corinth (2 Corinthians <b>2</b>:7?) could be lingering in the back of
Paul’s mind in Galatians <b>6</b>:1.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              (b) Placing Galatians
after 2 Corinthians accounts for Paul’s attitude toward suffering manifested in
the respective epistles. In 2 Corinthians<b> 11</b> he is conscious of
sufferings, but he finds relief that they are past. In Galatians, little he
mentions little about sufferings (<b>1</b>:10; <b>5</b>:11; <b>6</b>:17) as he
looks back on them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              (c) Similar doctrinal
expressions, illustrations, and statements exist in the 2
Corinthians-Galatians-Romans set of letters: Christ became sin for us
(Galatians <b>3</b>:13; 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:21); “sow sparingly” and “reap
sparingly” (Galatians <b>6</b>:7; 2 Corinthians<b> 9</b>:6); the “gospel” to
Abraham (Galatians <b>6</b>:3ff.; Romans <b>4</b>:3; “dead to the law” through
Christ’s body (Galatians<b> 2</b>:19-20; Romans<b> 7</b>:4); and similarities
in the vice lists (2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:20-21; Galatians <b>5</b>:19-21;
Romans <b>1</b>:29-30; <b>13</b>:13).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        4.   <i>“And all the brethren
with me”</i> (Galatians<b> 1</b>:2) fits well with the company that gradually
accumulated in collecting the gifts for the saints in Jerusalem (hence, <u>after
2 Corinthians</u>). </span></p>
