<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Determining from internal evidence the
authorship of John’s gospel requires establishing the identity of <i>“the
disciple whom Jesus loved”</i>: <i>“This </i>[disciple that Jesus loved] <i>is
the disciple that bears witness of these things and wrote them, and we know his
testimony is true”</i> (<b>21</b>:24 + 20). A similar comment appears in the
account of the spear thrust: <i>“He that has seen has borne witness, and his
witness is true; and he knows he says true things that you may believe”</i> (<b>19</b>:35;
cp. <b>20</b>:30-31). The characteristic description appears five times in the
gospel beginning with the night before Christ’s death: <b>13</b>:23; <b>19</b>:26;
<b>20</b>:2; <b>21</b>:7, and <b>21</b>:20.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span> Other more vague references to unnamed men include the
second of “two disciples” of John that heard Jesus speak (<b>1</b>:35-39), the
first being Andrew (<b>1</b>:40); and “another disciple,” known by the high
priest (<b>18</b>:15). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since <b>13</b>:23 appears during the
account of events in the upper room on the eve of the crucifixion, we surmise
that <b>(a)</b> <u>the writer was one of the twelve</u>. Jesus ate the Passover
meal with his apostles (Matthew <b>26</b>:17-30 = Mark <b>14</b>:12-26 = Luke <b>22</b>:7-39).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            So it is virtually certain that <b>(b) </b><u>no
apostle that accompanies <i>“the disciple Jesus loved”</i> is the author</u>. That
observation eliminates <u>Simon Peter</u> (<b>13</b>:8, <i>etc</i>.; <b>21</b>:2,
<i>etc</i>.), <u>Thomas Didymus</u> (<b>14</b>:5, <i>etc.</i>; <b>21</b>:2, <i>etc</i>.),
<u>Philip</u> (<b>14</b>:8, <i>etc.</i>), <u>Nathanael</u> (<b>21</b>:2), and,
of course, <u>Judas Iscariot</u> (<b>13</b>:2, <i>etc.</i>). We assume that the
writer consistently used this self-description and did not also name himself in
these accounts. Although he could have done both, one of the three most
prominent apostles is not named in the fourth gospel.                       </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another assumption is that <u>only</u> the
Twelve attended the Last Supper. Mark <b>14</b>:51-52 mentions a “young man” that
accompanied Jesus and the apostles to the Garden after the Passover meal. The
unidentified person may have been John Mark since the incident is only in his
gospel. Instead of being present in the upper room, however, he may have lived
in the house where the Supper was held; when he heard the company leave for
Gethsemane, he followed them (Mark <b>14</b>:52). Later, when the angel
released Peter from prison, he went to Mark’s mother’s</span><sup><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>2</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> house,
where many had gathered to pray (Acts <b>12</b>:12). Several later incidents
may have occurred in this same place, including some of the appearances (Mark <b>16</b>:14
= Luke<b> 24</b>:33-43 = John <b>20</b>:19-29) and the proceedings that led to
Pentecost (<i>“the upper chamber” </i>of Acts <b>1</b>:12-2:4).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(c)</b> <u>No one specifically named in
the gospel is the author</u>. The reason for substituting a description for his
name would apply anywhere his name would otherwise have appeared. On that
basis, we can set aside <u>Andrew</u> <b>(1</b>:40, <i>etc</i>.); <i>“Judas,
not Iscariot”</i> (<b>14</b>:22), whom we identify with <u>Judas, son of James</u>
(Luke <b>6</b>:16; Acts <b>1</b>:13); and <u>Thaddaeus Libbaeus</u> (Matthew <b>10</b>:3;
Mark <b>3</b>:18; see elsewhere <i>Critical Introduction to the New Testament</i>
document “Comparing Listings of Apostles”). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(d) </b><u>Matthew has his own gospel</u>,
and <b>(e)</b> <u>James, the brother of John, is not likely because he was martyred
so early</u>—by A.D. 44 (Acts <b>12</b>:2).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            These observations remove eight apostles
as authors of the fourth gospel, which leaves John, the son of Zebedee;
Bartholomew; James, the son of Alphaeus; and Simon, the Cananaean/Zelotes. Nathanael
evidently equals either Bartholomew; James, the son of Alphaeus; or Simon the
Cananaean. Since Simon already has a second designation, Nathanael must be one
of the first two. In that case, the other is a possible author. On the basis of
the synoptics, however, the apostle John was by far the most prominent of these
four, being referred to the most often,<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span> being one of the inner circle of three—Peter, James, and
John (Mark <b>5</b>:37 = Luke<b> 8</b>:51; Matthew <b>17</b>:1 = Mark <b>9</b>:2
= Luke <b>9</b>:28; Matthew <b>26</b>:37 = Mark <b>14</b>:33), and becoming
later a pillar of the Jerusalem church (Galatians <b>2</b>:9). His absence from
John’s narrative is conspicuous. Johannine authorship is affirmed by consistent
external testimony of early Christian writers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Why did John choose that description for
himself? His reticence at naming himself looks away from supposing it implies
favoritism. James and John were <u>not</u> promised the right- and left-hand
seats in the kingdom (Matthew <b>20</b>:20-28; Mark <b>10</b>:35-45). <b>(1)</b>
It may be an understatement chosen for a name. After all, he notes that Jesus
loved his disciples to the end (<b>17</b>:2). <b>(2) </b>It may have been a
fact that impressed him, being one of the two <i>“sons of thunder”</i> (Mark<b>
3</b>:17). That designation for him and his brother makes an interesting
contrast to the emphasis on love found in Johannine literature. Sometimes what
strikes people is what they lack in themselves. The descriptor reflects his
response to Jesus’ love more than an objective difference in the way Jesus
related to him. It would not imply favoritism; it would be a positive statement
rather than a contrastive one. There may have been a special closeness between
John and Jesus as perhaps implied by John’s being next to Jesus and leaning his
head back on the Master’s chest during the Passover meal (<b>13</b>:25). John
seems to have been younger than some of the other apostles since he was apparently
the last apostle to die; he outran Peter to the tomb of Jesus (<b>20</b>:3-4). Because
of his youth, Jesus may have taken special interest in him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since at the time of writing, John was
probably the only apostle alive, the point may be that <b>(3) </b>in contrast
to his readers and everyone else at that time, John’s life touched the life of
the Lord himself. He had “tangibly” experienced the love of Jesus. That slant
fits with his stress on the direct knowledge of the events he records and on
the accuracy of his record (<b>19</b>:35; <b>20</b>:30-31; <b>21</b>:24-25; 1
John <b>1</b>:1-4). From his contemporary perspective, he was the disciple whom
<u>Jesus</u> loved. His readers should be sure that the love of Jesus was real,
and that it would be important to them in the persecutions that lay ahead for
them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, in contrast to the Gnostic’s secret
knowledge for gaining salvation from hypostatic dualism, <b>(4)</b> the
interpersonal <u>love</u> of Christ for his people defines the medium of
Christian truth in this life and the next (cp. 1 John <b>3</b>:1-2; cp. 1
Corinthians <b>13</b>:8). The readers of the fourth gospel should center their
understanding and experience of the faith on the same thing the writer did; they
should be <i>“disciples whom Jesus loves.”</i> </span></p>

We doubt that much significance belongs to the difference. The two terms
together offer a more complete description of the relationship between Jesus

Mark <b>14</b>:14-15; Mark equals Luke <b>22</b>:11). John says nothing about
the location of the Supper. In the end, these speculations get us no closer to
additional persons at the Supper and as candidates for authoring the fourth
gospel: Mark has his own gospel.</span></p>
