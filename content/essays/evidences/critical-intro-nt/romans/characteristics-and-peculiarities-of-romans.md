1.	With the exception of Luke<strong> 20</strong>:16, Romans is the book that most uses the Pauline expression <em>God forbid</em> (μὴ γένοιτο, <em>mē genoito</em>):<strong> 3</strong>:4, 6, 31; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:2, 15; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:7, 13; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:14; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:1, 11. It appears also in 1 Corinthians<strong> 6</strong>:15; Galatians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:17; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:21; cp. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:14.*

The longest list of individuals saluted (<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:3-16). In Colossians the long list of names

consists of saluters (<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:7-14, five; while Romans contains seven—eight including Tertius).

3.		The only Pauline letter to a church Paul did not found (Colossians might be another.)

Makes extensive use of rhetorical questions: <em>“Shall we . . .”</em>:  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:5; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:1; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:1, 2; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:7;

<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:31; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:14, 30

5.		The only letter where an amanuensis speaks in his own name (<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:22)

6.	The only source that makes clear that there was more than one meeting unit in the city (<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:4-5, 14, 15)

Hebrews<strong> 1</strong>:5-13 and Romans<strong> 3</strong>:10-18 (from Psalms and Isaiah) have the longest

catenas of scripture.

Has the greatest amount of textual difficulty: the placements of the doxology and

benediction as well as possible precursors of the book without chapter (<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>-)<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>

9.	Only Paul uses “image (of God)” in an ethical sense (<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:29,<em> etc</em>.)

10.	    Serves as something of a companion volume to Galatians. It amounts to a lengthened version of the earlier, shorter epistle—or perhaps more exactly, a longer version of the doctrinal section in Galatians (<strong>3-4</strong>).
