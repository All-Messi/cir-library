Has the greatest number who send salutations of any New Testament writing. Philemon has a goodly number as well. Romans has by far the greatest number of saluted people.


Only book to refer to a Christian writing that is probably no longer (evidently) extant


Only book where a New Testament writer adopts the Gnostics’ <em>pleroma</em>, <em>etc</em>., as an image for understanding the role of Christ


Along with Ephesians (<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:9; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:3-9; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:19) and Romans (<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:25), Colossians uses the term <em>mystery</em> (μυστήριον, <em>mystērion</em>) to indicate the idea that the Gentiles as Gentiles had access to fellowship with God through Christ: <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:26-27; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3.


<em>“Firstborn of all creation”</em> is a unique usage of <em>firstborn</em> (πρωτότοκος, <em>prōtotokos</em>) as a reference to Christ (<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:15). He is elsewhere the firstborn from the dead (Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:18; Revelation <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:5), firstborn among many brothers (Romans <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:29), and the firstborn coming into the world (Hebrews <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:6)
