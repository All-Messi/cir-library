<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The “synoptic problem” addresses the
relationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The degree of their <u>similarity</u>
calls for explanation beyond what happened. Their unusual similarity is then
complicated by the <u>differences</u> between them. Evangelical perspective
calls for minimizing appeal to <u>contradiction</u> to solve the question. The
synoptic phenomenon is part of the “gospel problem” as a whole. In addition to
the characteristics of all four gospels, the synoptic problem focuses on features
shared by the first three. The following considerations highlight how alike
they are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A.  The contrast between the <u>synoptics
and John</u>. The similarity between the first three gospels is striking on any
count, but laying them individually and collectively alongside John, highlights
their own similarity and accentuates the difference between them and John. It
draws attention to the variety that could have existed between all four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  B.  The <u>brevity of the gospels</u>
relative to the length of Jesus’ life and ministry. John remarks, <i>“The world
itself would not hold the books that would be written”</i> (John <b>21</b>:25;
cp. <b>20</b>:30-31). How is it that out of <i>“everything Jesus began to do
and to teach”</i> (Acts<b> 1</b>:1), the synoptics have such a high proportion
of the same incidents that form such a minority of what all happened?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  C.  The <u>approximately equal
length of the gospels and their shared pericopes</u>. The equal length of the
gospels may be due to standardized lengths of papyrus and parchment scrolls. It
may represent a dimension that readers were accustomed to, which addresses the
gospels’ usefulness. The teaching blocks seems too brief to recount whole
sermons unless Jesus repeated his materials in set forms for the benefit of his
apostles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  D.  The <u>same wording</u> in
multiple accounts even in narrative portions. Verbal similarity in the teaching
material we might explain as the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of Jesus. Statements
about what happened are less alike, but they still bear a greater likeness than
we would expect in independent accounts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  E.   There is a <u>similarity in
sequence</u>, which could be explained from either a literary connection or
historical foundation.</span></p>

for Solving the Synoptic Problem </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A.  <u>Names associated with the
gospels are correct</u>. There is no <i>a priori</i> reason to start with the
idea that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John did not write the gospels that bear
their names. We say that acknowledging that only Luke and John have much
internal evidence useful for determining authorship. Luke combines with Acts to
form a two-volume work, and within Acts the “we” passages place the author with
Paul at Rome. If Paul wrote Colossians at Rome, from the names in Colossians<b>
4</b> the <i>“beloved physician”</i> Luke emerges as the most likely candidate
for writing Luke-Acts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        In the case of John, <i>“the
disciple Jesus loved” </i>was in the upper room, hence, one of the apostles,
and so distinguished from any apostle mentioned alongside that cryptogram. By
elimination, John is virtually certain to be the author (<b>21</b>:20 + 24). A
few items in Matthew and Mark fit with, but do not lead to, the conclusion that
they were the authors. We depend on early Christian testimony about Matthew and
Mark; so the issue in these two cases is not the reliability of scripture but of
tradition. But we have no reason to reject the uniform witness of early
Christian writers on such a purely historical matter as authorship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  B.  <u>Natural and supernatural
factors combined to produce the synoptics</u>. Regarding the <b>supernatural
component</b>, we know that the writers had the assistance of the Holy Spirit. In
the upper room the night before his crucifixion, Jesus promised the apostles
that the Father would send the Spirit to teach them everything they needed to
know and help them remember everything Jesus had told them (John <b>14</b>:26;
cp. <b>2</b>:22; <b>12</b>:16 as well as Luke <b>24</b>:8). The Spirit’s
assistance would apply as much to literary efforts as to oral proclamation. So,
we do not have to find natural explanations for all the synoptic phenomena, nor
do we have to reinterpret those phenomena as natural occurrences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Not needing to reinterpret the
synoptic phenomena, we can illustrate this way. Under normal circumstances
people cannot recall word-for-word someone else’s presentation from a year of
two before.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> The gospels are
not likely to have been written for some decades after what they record. Although
the writers were orally delivering meantime what later they wrote down, natural
recall is not a likely option for explaining the synoptic records. On the other
hand, we could reinterpret the discourses of Jesus as “gists” of what he said—and
we are inclined to do that for independent reasons; but we are not forced to do
so, because the Spirit’s assistance could compensate for human deficiency. We
could also imagine that they were as much the creations of the early church as
they were accurate recollections of Christ’s actual presentations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        In John <b>14</b>, Jesus promised
his <u>apostles</u> Holy Spirit assistance; so supernatural aid would clearly
find expression in the first and fourth gospels—Matthew and John. (The fact
that Matthew was the only apostolic synoptist may lie behind Augustine’s notion
that he wrote first and Mark abbreviated his account.) But we infer that the
apostolicity principle applies indirectly to Mark and Luke, because Mark served
as the interpreter for Peter according to early Christian testimony, and Luke
worked under Paul’s direction as the New Testament itself shows (Acts of
Apostles). Since Paul was an apostle in the primary sense, we extend to him the
same promises and rights as to the original twelve; he fulfilled the same role
they did (cp. Galatians <b>2</b>:6-10, <i>e.g</i>.).    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The Spirit could have operated
positively and restrictively. Restrictively he could have protected them from <u>misunderstanding</u>
Jesus’ teachings, <u>miswording</u> their records of what he had said ad done, <u>misexplaining</u>
his motives and thoughts, <u>misidentifying</u> connections between Old
Testament predictions and Messianic fulfillments, <u>misapplying</u> content to
their purposes of writing. Positively the Spirit could have given the
evangelists <u>awareness</u> of things Jesus did when he was alone, intensified
their <u>memory</u> of his ideas and words, guided them in <u>selecting</u>
what was important for posterity and relevant to the purposes of each gospel
and the needs of its audience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Supernatural aid complements
the <b>natural component</b> in solving the synoptic problem. Making the Spirit
the whole explanation represents overkill. Not only should there be a realistic
balance between supernatural and natural factors; but if we operate on the
principle that God does not do for his people what they can do for themselves,
we should assume that natural explanations account for as much as it can before
we invoke supernatural ones. God’s not doing for people what they can do for
themselves correlates with his being more glorified by the <u>less</u> he does
for them. Sufficiency operates here as a principle in divine-human interaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  C.  <u>The synoptics present actual
historical events</u>. We see no reason to approach the synoptic problem supposing
that Matthew, Mark, and Luke are like the <i>Iliad</i> or <i>Odyssey</i> much
less <i>Agamemnon</i> or <i>The Trojan Women</i>. Synoptic events and sayings came
from Jesus instead of in the early church. The gospels need not be creations by
later Christians more than accounts of the historical Jesus. They are not
literary productions that appropriate a historical core of characters and events
to form a framework for presenting their own ideas. Unlike <i>The Last
Temptation</i>, the synoptics purport not to project their authors’
self-analyses, but to record the words and deeds of a person who radically
moved them from such uncertainties to a personal relationship with Ultimate
Reality historicized, concretized, incarnated before their very eyes, heard
with their own ears, and touched by their own hands (Luke<b> 1</b>:3; John <b>19</b>:35;
<b>21</b>:24). These are not myths in even the most wholesome sense of that
term (2 Peter <b>1</b>:16-21). They are not literary productions even to the
degree that Job and Jonah seem to be in the Old Testament.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        John claims to have seen the
events he presents (John <b>19</b>:32-37; <b>20</b>:30-31; <b>21</b>:24-25; 1
John <b>1</b>:1-4; cp. John <b>20</b>:24-29, <i>etc</i>.). Luke says that he
interviewed ministers and eyewitnesses (Luke <b>1</b>:1-4). Both Luke and John
emphasize their concern for accuracy and their claim to represent it. The
gospels derive from accurate eyewitness testimony about real historical events.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  D.  <u>Inspiration applies at the
point of inscripturation</u>. Even as the synoptics do not have to be total
creations by the Holy Spirit, so also they do not have to be productions “from
scratch” by each writer. There is no objection to gathering information to
produce the accounts. Using oral as well as written sources (Luke <b>1</b>:1)
is appropriate as long as some factor allows the writers to stand above total
dependence on such sources. They could have researched matters not known by
personal observation or divine revelation. That factor lies in their own
awareness of what they recorded as well as the restrictive/protective/preventative
work of the Spirit. We can envision their interviewing <i>“eyewitnesses and
ministers of the word,”</i> reading preliminary accounts of various things
Jesus did, and even using other canonical gospels in preparing their own. Using
sources does not mean blindly depending on them. Any natural activity could
have preceded final production as long as supernatural oversight occurred at
the point of writing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. Aspects of the Synoptic Problem</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The task is to account for <u>similarities</u>
and <u>differences</u> in length, selection, sequence, and wording. <i>Length</i>
applies to the size of the gospels and their parallel pericopes. Something must
explain the fact that the gospels are neither pamphlets nor full-length books;
there are no three-page summaries, on the one hand, or New-Testament-length
books, on the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>Selection </i>accentuates the
high proportion of common events that together comprise a small percentage of what
happened. Selection dalsm with the material common to all three synoptics, the
material common to the first and third, the small amount peculiar in each one,
and the large amount peculiar to John’s account. John seems deliberately to
have “written around” the synoptics. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>Sequence</i> addresses the fact
that there is agreement, not only in the order of the pericopes but also within
their sub-units. With minor exceptions Matthew and Luke never agree against
Mark even though Matthew departs the Mark-Luke sequence in favor of a topical
arrangement in some cases. Luke <b>9</b>:51-<b>18</b>:14 shows no parallel
blocks with Matthew and Mark, even though pieces here and there in that block
does parallel the first two synoptists. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The <i>wording</i> of accounts is
often very close, particularly in the teaching sections and to a lesser degree
in the historical connections between them. These similarities are more evident
in the Greek original than they are in translation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Student of this issue need to see a <u>balance
between similarities and differences</u> across the synoptics. Some scholars
seem to get so caught up in highlighting the likenesses that they undersell the
differences. In reaction, evangelicals stress the differences so as to downplay
the likenesses. There is no value in skewing the facts either way. There is
nothing to hide and everything to face head on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                   Finally, the best solution to the
synoptic problem invokes mechanisms that account for <u>similarities and
differences conjointly</u>. Reasons given for similarities must be appropriate
to accounting for differences at the same time. Picturing the authors as
slavishly copying the same written sources predicts a result too high in verbal
agreement. Picturing them as independent workers predicts results too
dissimilar. Instead, we look for a complex of processes that yields an
appropriate combination of difference and likeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>IV. Factors Particularly Relevant to Solving the
Synoptic Problem  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A.  <u>First-century Mediterranean
cultures were more oral</u> than the paper-and-ink cultures in the nineteenth-,
twentieth-, and twenty-first century Western world. Manuscripts of the Koran
were at one time corrected against the memory of a Muslim sage. Some African
cultures like those in the story of <i>Roots</i> have had special individuals
whose role is to preserve in their memory the history of their tribe. The
oral-culture factor looks away from trying to account for the synoptic
phenomenon solely or primarily by writing-based mechanisms. If the written
medium is primary, we are more inclined to assign a deliberate reason for each
difference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  B.  <u>Rabbinic religious
instruction relied heavily on memorization</u>. Centuries passed before the
Talmudic, Mishnaic, and Midrashic materials came into writing. That helped
communicate a distinction between Torah and tradition, canon and interpretation,
statutory law and case law. In other connections, scholars have suggested that
Matthew divided his genealogy of Jesus into three sets of fourteen to make
memorizing it easier. Presumably he dropped out the omitted names to get the
scheme to work better. Similarly, the lists of apostles are always in three
sets of four with the same person first in each set. The practice is
reminiscent of “<b><u>E</u></b>very <b><u>g</u></b>ood <b><u>b</u></b>oy <b><u>d</u></b>oes
<b><u>f</u></b>ine” for the lines of the treble clef, or “<b><u>M</u></b>y <b><u>v</u></b>ery
<b><u>e</u></b>ager <b><u>m</u></b>other <b><u>j</u></b>ust <b><u>s</u></b>erved
<b><u>u</u></b>s <b><u>n</u></b>achos” for the order of the planets from the
sun outward. Perhaps in part the synoptic pericopes are so short and so
similarly worded because they are summaries that required less to remember and
crystalizations that were easier to memorize. At any rate, as in John and Acts,
the synoptic accounts are too short for what Jesus would have said in a
three-and-a-half-year ministry and often too short for what he would have
needed to say to an original audience. (Perhaps Jesus himself delivered his
material in brief segments as a capable rabbi dealing orally with common people
in unstructured, open-air circumstances.) We can have some idea of what full
accounts would look like from the fact that twenty to nearly fifty percent of
the gospels deals only with the triumphal entry till the ascension, a period of
just seven seeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  C.  <u>A few decades elapsed before
apostolic preaching about the life of Jesus was reduced to writing</u>. Luke
himself illustrates this oral-then-written pattern when he writes so that
Theophilus might know the certainty of things wherein he had been orally
instructed (Luke <b>1</b>:3-4, </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>κατηχήθης</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&lt; </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>κατηχέω</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>,
cp. “catechism”). Inscripturating Messiah’s life and ministry loosely coincided
with the beginning of the <b>(1) <i>Gentile mission</i></b>, which created a
more widespread need for reliable accounts that could be multiplied and studied
between apostolic visits. Acts outlines the progress of the gospel from
Jerusalem to Rome after the manner of the Lord’s commission to evangelize <i>“Jerusalem,
Judaea, Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the earth” </i>(Acts<b> 1</b>:8;
cp. Luke <b>24</b>:47). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The suggestion that Matthew or
one of the other apostles took notes on what Jesus said and did is possible,
but we wonder about that likelihood. His disciples had little reason at the
time to prepare for writing later accounts of his life for long-term use after
his ascension. They probably thought that he would never leave: <i>“Messiah
abides forever”</i> (John <b>12</b>:34).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Prior to the martyrdom of
Stephen, <b>(a)</b> the first stage of proclamation took place largely confined
in <u>Palestine</u>—Jerusalem, Judaea, and Samaria. The main exception was the
conversion of Diasporic Jews during pilgrimages to the Jerusalem feasts—people
like the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts <b>8</b>:26-39) and Ananias of Damascus (Acts <b>9</b>:10-19;
note also the disciples of John later in Ephesus: Acts <b>19</b>:1-7). Many
events and teaching segments would not have been witnessed by people of Judaea,
for example, if they took place in Galilee, Samaria, Perea, the Decapolis. Even
if they occurred nearby, people would not necessarily have observed them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <b>(b)</b> The general
persecution that surrounded Stephen’s death initiated a second stage of evangelism.
Paul’s systematic persecution of Christians not only created the adverse effect
by spreading the gospel more uniformly throughout Judaea and Samaria (Acts <b>8</b>:1-2);
it spread it more significantly among <u>Jews outside Palestine</u>,
particularly in Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch (Acts <b>11</b>:19). So a need arose
for crystalized instruction not only in Palestine at an early date, but more so
later with the mission to the Diaspora and the subsequent Gentile mission. In
the latter two cases, there would have been a special need for knowing what had
happened during Messiah’s incarnation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <b>(c)</b> In Antioch,
however, a third stage began when <i>“men of Cyprus and Cyrene . . . spoke to <u>Greeks</u>
also”<b> </b></i>(Acts<b> 11</b>:20). These Gentile “godfearers [</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>σεβόμενοι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>,
<i>sebomenoi</i>]” were non-proselytes who became a bridge to the pagan world. With
Paul’s missionary activity, this third stage began in earnest (Acts <b>13</b>:1ff.).
Since Gentiles were so far removed geographically and timewise from the “Christ
events” in Palestine, their need to learn what had happened there was more
acute, especially when coupled with the next observation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The approaching death of the
primary witnesses of the resurrection brought a more urgent demand for written
accounts of Messiah’s ministry (Acts<b> 1</b>:8, 22; <b>2</b>:32; <b>4</b>:33;
cp. 1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:3-8ff.). Records were needed that could serve as <b>(2)</b>
<b><i>written functional equivalents to oral apostolic witness of the
resurrection</i></b>. The whole New Testament canon became the functional
equivalent of apostolic testimony (note 2 Peter <b>1</b>:12-14; <b>3</b>:1-2;
cp. Jude 17). That is one reason apostolicity along with catholicity became canonical
principles. The centrality of the resurrection in the apostles’ witness
explains the distinctive structure of gospels. The synoptics are resurrection-centered
and marked by apostolicity. So we should expect the solution to the synoptic
problem to begin with apostolicity. For that reason, we propose the scenarios
that conclude this essay. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Writing the gospels to replace
direct apostolic witness does not have to imply an unexpected delay in Christ’s
return, as scholars often do. Recasting the writing in this light unnecessarily
implies a misexpectancy for his soon second coming. The New Testament does not
give reason to think that the apostles misunderstood <i>“the blessed hope”</i>
in some way that affected their proclaiming and writing. In one place, Paul
even reminds the Thessalonians that Christ’s return was <u>not</u> immediate (2
Thessalonians <b>2</b>:1-12). In the New Testament and subsequent church
history, there has been an intentional ambiguity about the time of his return,
which creates tension between a sense of immediacy and the fact of not yet. Meantime,
the death of individual believers serves for them as the equivalent of the

was known as “the interpreter of Peter</u>” (Papias as cited by Eusebius in his

Alexandria, Origen, and Jerome all associate Mark with Peter in the production
of the second gospel. From the New Testament, we also learn that Mark worked
with Paul at the beginning and end of Paul’s Gentile ministry (Acts <b>13</b>:4-13;
2 Timothy <b>4</b>:11). Justin Martyr (<i>Trypho</i> 106) refers to Mark’s
peculiar words “Boanerges,” that is, ‘Sons of Thunder’” (Mark <b>3</b>:17), as
appearing in the “Memoirs of Peter” (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:

Gentile and Diasporic audiences the events of Jesus’ life. We assume that both
Paul and Peter and other missionaries beyond Palestine would need to
familiarize people with Christ’s work, not only as a part of the polemic for
Christianity, but for Christian growth after conversion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  F.   According to the “we passages”
in Acts, <u>Luke the physician was with Paul during his two-year incarceration
at Caesarea</u>. During that time he could have interviewed <i>“the ministers
and eyewitnesses of the word”</i> (Luke <b>1</b>:2-3). That could have
something to do with the lengthy section of “new material” in Luke <b>10-17</b>.
He could have gone to Jerusalem to interview Mary, whom Jesus in his dying
moments had committed to John’s care (at least for the immediate time; John <b>19</b>:25-27)
and whose residence would have been in the holy city even if she lived with
either of her sons James or Jude after their conversion. That may account for Luke’s
presenting the birth narrative from Mary’s viewpoint while Matthew presents it
through the eyes of Joseph. It may help account for the amount of material
dedicated to the events surrounding the death-resurrection of Jesus. Those
occurred in Jerusalem, and more resource people would have been available to
interview there. Luke could have had contact with Philip, “a minister of the
word,” who seems to have used Caesarea as his home base for twenty years or
more (Acts <b>8</b>:40 + <b>21</b>:8-9).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  G.  <u>At some point the gospel
materials were translated from Aramaic to Greek</u>. Jesus surely conducted his
ministry in the language of the common people. Even though Palestine was to
some extent trilingual (John <b>19</b>:20), his practice of identifying with
the masses would have meant using Aramaic in normal situations. Throughout the
synoptics and John, recurring Hebraisms indicate that the synoptics are
translation Greek. No Aramaic records of Christ’s life have come down to us
even though Papias (cp. Irenaeus, Pantaenus, and Origen) did say that Matthew
first wrote his <i>Logia</i> (gospel?) in Aramaic and people translated as best
they could. The striking similarities and noticeable differences between the
Greek synoptics become even more intriguing because they record in one language
what happened in another. We can hardly say that verbal likenesses are due to
full, exact quotations of Jesus’ original presentations, because that would
require identical translations in something of the way Jewish tradition said
the seventy-two Jewish scholars translated the Hebrew Old Testament into the
Greek Septuagint. Besides, the brevity of the individual sections shows that
they are summaries. The synoptics present inscripturated proclamation that
involved (a) summarization, (b) crystallization, (c) memorization, and (d)
translation. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  H.  <u>Many written narratives
existed before Luke wrote his gospel</u> (Luke <b>1</b>:1), and Luke knew about
them and may have consulted them. Apparently he considered them inadequate for
his own purposes. Since he wanted to write <i>“in an orderly fashion” </i>(<b>1</b>:4),
these narratives may have <u>lacked orderliness</u>. His desire to trace things
<i>“accurately”</i> (<b>1</b>:3) may imply that he was <u>not sure they were
wholly reliable</u>. <i>“Tracing the course of all things”</i> (<b>1</b>:3) may
suggest that they were <u>not as complete</u> as Luke wanted his account to be.
Those written pieces may have recorded only what their authors witnessed. Whether
he would have included Mark (and/or Matthew) among these narratives we cannot know.
Mark lacks a birth narrative for both Jesus and John the Baptist. Matthew and
Mark both begin with John’s ministry without explaining who he was, where he
came from, how he related to Jesus, or when his ministry began. (This might
imply that their audiences already knew such information or that it was already
available—in Luke?). Luke has much more didactic material than Mark (or even
Matthew). Since considering Mark inadequate would not have meant considering it
erroneous, Luke could have used it as a beginning point. Papias mentions a “sayings
source” Matthew wrote. If such things were available that concentrated on the
teachings of Jesus, Luke may have included some of their contents as well. Since
he wrote about what Jesus <i>“did and taught”</i> (Acts <b>1</b>:1), his own
purpose was bigger than Mark’s—who emphasized historical presentation—and that
of sayings source(s). Luke’s goal was larger than either of these. With him there
was awareness, if not use, of written sources.</span></p>

of selection implies interpretation. The writers chose events that were <u>representative</u>
of what Jesus did and said, that were <u>direction-setting</u> in his unfolding
ministry, that could <u>engender and confirm faith</u> (John <b>20</b>:30-31;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <u>Similarity in selection</u>
across the gospels comes from the need to stress<b> (a) </b><i>Jesus’
fulfillment of Messianic predictions</i> and to highlight (b) <i>events
surrounding his death-resurrection</i>. Both emphases have apologetic force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <u>Similarity in sequence and
wording</u> between the synoptics comes in part from what happened. These
eyewitnessed events and teachings came into the synoptics from (a) <i>natural
memory</i>, <b>(b)</b> <i>inspired memory </i>(John <b>14</b>:26), and
conceivably <b>(c) </b><i>notes by observers</i>. In regard to this last
possibility, it has been suggested that Matthew as a tax collector may have
been inclined to make such notations. There were even shorthand systems that
scribes like him could have used. There are analogies with other people who
accompanied important figures like Alexander the Great and kept logs of what
transpired. Jesus’ apostles would have had even greater respect for the
importance of Jesus as Messiah than Xenophon had for Alexander the Great.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <u>Similarity in wording</u>
could have been further enhanced by <i>crystallization through apostolic
repetition</i>. That would have occurred unconsciously to some extent, but
there could have been <i>“thumb-nail” digests deliberately prepared for
memorization purposes</i>. There was precedent for this in rabbinic pedagogy
presumably used by teachers like Gamaliel with men like Saul of Tarsus. That
could have been <u>Paul’s project with Luke</u> during the incarceration in
Caesarea; that could have issued in the Gospel of Luke and spread to the other
gospels if we are inclined to adopt Lucan priority among the synoptics. A
similar process could have originated with <u>Peter</u> and issued through Mark
into his gospel, and the other synoptics followed that lead. <u>Matthew</u> may
have been the source of the crystallization, which then spread to the other two
synoptics. These three suggestions could correlate with corresponding theories
about the priority of each of these writers. Maybe sayings sources (<i>logia</i>)
were collections of such crystalizations. A combination of these processes rounds
out a list of possibilities for the origin of the synoptics as we know them. As
a “rabbi,” <i><u>Jesus</u> himself may have originally delivered his teaching
in memorizable manner</i> and culturally relevant fashion. His model prayer is
a case in point (Matthew <b>6</b>:9-13; Luke <b>11</b>:2-4), even as John had
evidently taught his disciples memorized prayers (Luke <b>11</b>:1), or
sketches for prayer. Jesus’ extensive use of parables and vivid imageries
likewise speaks of an approach to teaching informed by the culture’s
predominantly oral society. Similarity in wording is greatest in the teaching
material, but not exclusively there, because close wording appears also in the
historical splices between didactic blocks and in historical pericopes that
have little sayings content. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <u>Differences in selection,
order, and wording</u> come from the different concerns Matthew, Mark, and Luke
had. Different purposes relate to different destinations, or audiences, and
their needs. <i>Deliberate change</i> from oral or written sources in front of
them would mean omitting certain things, adding others, and changing what was
before them. John especially, but Luke as well, makes statements about the
Logos and deeds of the Messianic Son of God that accentuate his corporeality. John
did this, we suppose, to combat Gnostic influences in the Gentiles churches at
the time he wrote in Asia (Ephesus?). Mark’s Gentile destination may have
caused him uniquely to include the phrase <i>“house of prayer <u>for all
nations</u></i>, the Old Testament text cited in connection with the cleansing
of the temple (Mark <b>11</b>:17). Matthew uses “kingdom of heaven” in ten
places where the Mark and Luke parallels have “kingdom of God.” Matthew may
have stressed to his Jewish audience that the Messianic “kingdom” was <u>not</u>
a political, geographical, national one as they had expected. At any rate, his
almost uniform usage of “kingdom of heaven” has to be a deliberate change from
any sources he had (or <i>vice versa</i>). Matthew’s terminology has to change Jesus’
actual wording. Jesus did not use both expressions simultaneously. Matthew
chose to express the <u>sense</u> of Messiah’s words rather than the <u>words</u>
themselves. The differences in wording would be deliberate changes by the
second writer. They could also be due to translation differences from an
Aramaic original, whether written or oral. They could be variant expressions of
a common crystalized oral tradition, whether in Aramaic or Greek</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <i>Similar material repeated
on different occasions </i>may account for similar, though different, entries. Scholars
infer that the Parable of the Pounds in Luke <b>19</b>:11-27 and the Parable of
the Talents in Matthew <b>25</b>:14-30 are two forms of the same story that
grew up in the early church. But Jesus himself could as easily have told
similar parables for similar reasons on different occasions. The mustard seed
imagery appears twice in Matthew’s gospel but with different applications (<b>13</b>:31-32;
<b>17</b>:20; cp. Paul’s use of the foundation figure on two occasions in teaching
somewhat different lessons: 1 Corinthians <b>3</b>:10-15; Ephesians <b>2</b>:20-22).
People in Galilee would have needed to hear the same things Jesus taught in
Judaea, Perea, or Samaria, and <i>vice versa</i>; so there is <i>prima facie</i>
reason to think that repetition occurred in the teaching material and that
these similar presentations could be conflated, or “melted together,” in later
presentations by his disciples, who had accompanied him to all these places. Quite
a bit of the material in Luke <b>10</b>:1-<b>18</b>:14 amounts to snatches and
pieces that show up in other settings in Matthew and Mark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Differences in sequence may be
due to <i>topical interest</i>, as when Matthew relative to Mark and Luke
re-sequences pericopes in chapters <b>4-14</b>. <i>Difference in stress</i>
could explain some dissimilarities. John (<b>2</b>:13-22) puts the cleansing of
the temple at the front of Jesus’ ministry rather than at the end (Matthew <b>21</b>:12-17;
Mark <b>11</b>:15-18; Luke <b>19</b>:45-48), perhaps to set a tone for the
radical dissimilarity between Mosaism and Messianism. There could have been two
cleansings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <i>Memorized oral
crystallization</i> implies undesigned difference. It offers a mechanism for
alteration that does not have to be intentional. It affords greater flexibility
in wording and tends to keep accuracy at the level of concept more than words,
especially since translation from Aramaic to Greek occurred at some point. If
synoptic interdependency or dependency on common sources happened in the
written medium, then word-level precision would be greater than in the oral
medium. We would look more for reasons for dropping something, reordering,
rewording, or adding; but writing from memory does not predict as much concern
for such precision. Expression is more approximate, and ideas are more clearly
the point. Memorizable digests could even provide for true <u>inter</u>dependency
in that one preacher might hear another make the presentation in a way that
affected his own way of saying it, and his could at another time </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>affect</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'> that other person’s wording. Such a thing could not easily have
happened in writing. Finally, oral crystallization could mean that, instead of
slavishly reproducing a standardized digest prepared, say, by Peter, an
eyewitness like Matthew might lapse into his own accounting or add in
information around that other layout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        In summary, <u>similarity in

(3) literary interdependence, <i>vs.</i> (4) topical re-arrangement. <u>Similarity
in wording</u> could have come from (a) actual words, (b) oral fixation, or (c)
written crystallization. <u>Differences in sequence and wording</u> could come
from (1) free rendering of Aramaic originals by independent synoptists, (2)
free expression from memory of fixed oral tradition regularized in Greek, (3)
conscious change from oral or written sources because of different purposes
relative to different readers. <u>Different selection</u> could have come from
(a) different oral and written sources, and (b) different purposes. The
synoptics show a combination of differences and likenesses without
contradiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The long years of orally recounting
the life of Jesus in the apostles’ witness combines with the greater oral
character of first-century Jewish culture and the Rabbinic tradition of
memorization as a learning technique. We suppose that there were three steps in
the formation of the synoptics. (a) The events occurred in the presence of
eyewitnesses (with some notes conceivably taken, natural memory plus the
enhanced memory later added). (b) They were told and retold in the apostolic
preaching. With this process came unconscious and deliberate summarization and
crystallization that produced memorizable digests. (c) The gospels were written
to multiply the apostolic witness, replace that witness at the time of their
impending death, aid in the Gentile mission, and perhaps serve a liturgical
purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Oral crystallization of
memorizable pericopes allows for several possible scenarios. The
crystallization could have been done by Jesus himself in some cases (model
prayer, <i>e.g</i>.), by Peter, by Matthew, by Paul. The crystallization could
have been a combination of unconscious and deliberate work. One scenario could
trace the process through Peter, thence to Mark and the other synoptists. Another
could trace it through Paul, then to Luke, and the other two synoptics. Matthew
and Luke would not derive from Mark’s gospel necessarily but from common
awareness of crystalized episodes. Centering the apostolic witness, hence the
synoptics, on Peter is natural because he was the unofficial spokesman for the
twelve, as the gospels and early chapters of Acts show (cp. Galatians <b>2</b>).
He witnessed Jesus’ whole ministry, and by personality he was the central
proclaimer of record in the early years of the emerging church. The drawback is
that his background would not make him the most likely one to cast the form of
proclamation in Rabbinic style. Centering the apostolic witness on Paul has the
advantage of his known familiarity with Rabbinic style, but offsetting this
advantage is his not being an eyewitness of (much of) Jesus’ ministry.
Moreover, he was converted a few years after the proclamation had been going
on, and he could not operate in Palestine because of Jewish threats against his
life. Approaching the process through Matthew could account for Papias’
statement that he wrote a <i>Logia</i>, which may have been a sayings source
rather than his gospel as we have it. What has come down to us may be a later
effort of his to present a more complete record. Combining the different
possibilities gives us perhaps the best order of complexity to correspond with
the complex phenomena we are trying to account for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        A summary of scenarios would
include several <u>history-based approaches</u>: <b>(a)</b> Jesus himself
presenting short, memorizable, materials used by the apostles and eventually
written down (But many cases seem too short for the assumed setting they record.);
<b>(b)</b> note-taking by someone like Matthew as he accompanied Jesus during
his ministry, with the resultant writing of a gospel based on these notes; <b>(c)
</b>oral crystallization of originally longer material combined with deliberate
condensation of accounts for memorization purposes and ultimate writing of this
material—the process could have begun with Peter and gone through Mark to the
other synoptists, or begun with Paul and gone through Luke to the others (or
with a note-taking Matthew on to Mark and Luke), and it could have been
combined with research of witnesses and previous documents. We are setting
aside a <b>(d)</b> process that goes on primarily in the written medium,
because such an process would predict even more similarity than we see across
the synoptics. We are especially setting aside </span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt'> approach</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>—<b>(e)

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        In suggesting this set of
interacting scenarios, we imply several points that bear on the nature of scripture
and God-breathedness. <b>(1) </b>Each gospel does not have to be written “<u>from

protection from error exists at the point of inscripturation. <b>(2) </b>The

newly being written could intentionally repeat/use or deliberately write around
the previously existing ones. <b>(3)</b> The accounts do not have to represent
the <u>exact words</u> of Jesus. (They cannot because of the translation variable.)
It is sufficient for them to represent his <u>ideas</u>. <b>(4)</b> The gospels
do not have to present <u>all the concepts that Jesus said in a particular case</u>.
Even as they do not contain every incident of ords and deeds so also within
each pericope they may be digests of his presentation. <b>(5)</b> The
presentations do not have to represent the <u>whole of each individual concept
