because they <u>illuminate</u> scripture. In addition, they often <u>confirm</u>
the biblical record and occasionally may even help <u>prove</u> its
trustworthiness in regard to things that can be tested. Consequently, we tend
to view historical backgrounds favorably as a valuable resource. This
presentation, however, stresses another observation. Like all sources of
information, historical background, misused, can harm rather than help biblical
studies. In the wrong hands, it can be invoked in ways that detract from
hermeneutical and apologetic concerns.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Two related presuppositions often
cause scholars and professional theologians to misconnect or equivocate
biblical and extra-biblical phenomena: (a) frequently their antisupernatural
bias prompts them to develop (b) an evolutionary, naturalistic explanation for
Christian origins. If historical backgrounds can be woven into a developmental
scheme, supernatural explanation becomes gratuitous; the truthfulness of the faith
is compromised; and Christ’s claim on human allegiance is nullified.</span></p>

margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Our concern in this brief presentation
is to make a distinction between the use of the Old Testament found in the Book
of Hebrews and that found in the writings of Philo of Alexandria (30 B.C.-A.D.
45). Commentators often try to parallel the two. Drawing on the earlier work of
an Alexandrian Jewish philosopher named Aristobulus (fl. 160 B.C.), Philo used
allegory to find in Holy Writ the concepts of Greek thought, thereby uniting
Greek philosophy and Jewish revelation. Having claimed that the Hebrew writer
employs Philo’s allegorizing practices, scholars proceed to integrate other
items with this claim to make the case more plausible. (1) Apollos is proposed
as the author of Hebrews because he was an eloquent man from Alexandria (Acts <b>19</b>:1),
Philo’s native city. (2) The earliest and strongest attestation to the
apostolicity of Hebrews comes out of the catechetical school in that same city
during the second and third centuries. (3) <i>“Those of/from Italy”</i> who
send salutations (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>οἱ</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀπὸ</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>hoi apo tēs Italias</i>; <b>13</b>:24) were “away
from” Italy—in Alexandria perhaps (?). (4) The Septuagint was the Bible of the
Hebrew writer and presumably his audience as well. He consistently uses it
throughout his “word of exhortation” (<b>13</b>:22) and even bases arguments on
its distinctive wording (Psalm <b>40</b>:6-8 in Hebrews <b>10</b>:5-14) and
contents (Deuteronomy <b>32</b>:43 in Hebrews <b>1</b>:6). The Septuagint
significantly differs in these places from at least the standardized Hebrew
text of the Masoretes as well as other forms of the Old Testament text that
have come down to us. The Septuagint translation was made in Alexandria. Since
the allegorical method is artificial, New Testament writers’ use of it on Old
Testament revelation would be artificial, their inspiration would become
suspect, and the implied apologetic from prediction-fulfillment would be
undercut. Trying to equate the hermeneutics of Hebrews and Philo represents a
significant dysfunctional use of biblical backgrounds. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Historically the use of allegory
became important in the early church by working its way into early Christian
writings like <i>The Shepherd of Hermas </i>and <i>The Epistle of Barnabas</i>
and into the theologizing of many Christian leaders including Clement of Rome,
Polycarp, Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Lactantius, Hilary, Origen, Jerome, Augustine,
and a host of others all the way down into the Middle Ages. Indeed, a person
wonders how Christianity fared as well as it did, given the apparent weakness
of church leaders as judged from their lack of facility in exegesis. Even as
the <u>Stoics</u> had used allegory to harmonize Homer with their own later
views and <u>Philo</u> had used it to read Greek philosophy into Old Testament
revelation, so also <u>Christians</u> tried to use allegory to solve the problem
of covenant distinctions: they spiritualized the Old Covenant in terms of the
New. <u>Gnostic</u> heretics used it to bend biblical teaching in the direction
of their philosophical speculations. Allegorizing continued to be a plague in
biblical interpretation even into the time of the Reformation. Today there
appears to be a revival of allegory, particularly among some <u>Pentecostals</u>,
who use it as a supposed basis for claiming to offer special insight, further
revelation, or predictive prophecy, all of which are thereby put beyond
hermeneutical investigation and correction because they do not depend on hermeneutical
method to start with. A negative influence so long-lasting and all-pervasive as
allegorizing has been must certainly be distinguished from the manner in which
scripture itself demonstrates how to rightly divide the word of revealed truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                We illustrate the contrast between
Philo and Hebrews, first by making some general observations and then by
offering a test case from the first chapter of the book. (1) The Hebrew writer
did his work <u>from the vantage point of fulfilled prediction</u>. Consequently,
he was in a position to make more precise correlations between the Messianic
age and prophecies about it than if he had not witnessed the fulfillment of
predictions he adduces. Such circumstances differ from reading unfulfilled
prophecies and exegetically deriving such specific ideas from them or from
taking historical narratives and allegorically assigning cryptic spiritual
messages to them. The accomplished Messianic anticipations show that the ideas
are true which Hebrews presents in connection with Genesis, Psalms, 2 Samuel,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos. The later historical fulfillments had greater
exactness than the earlier predictive utterances had clarity, a pattern
naturally characteristic of fulfillment in comparison to prediction. It only
remains for us to work out the connection if it is not immediately obvious in
given instances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                (2) The Hebrew writer makes his
observations <u>from the explicit contents of the Old Testament</u> Psalms and
prophets and from earlier historical events to which they allude. He deals with
the text in a historico-grammatical sense rather than at some supposed
allegorical, analogical, or spiritual level that could not be obtained by means
of the Old Testament verbal communication itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                (3) The Hebrew writer sometimes makes
his observations <u>by necessary inference</u> from the express contents of Old
Testament scripture—mixed, of course, with explicit statements and experienced
fulfillment. Psalm <b>100</b>:4 plus Genesis <b>14</b>:18-20 is a prime
example. Its prediction about a <u>new</u> <b>priesthood</b> implies <u>change
of priesthood</u>, which implies a <u>change of the law</u> at least about
priesthood qualifications, which further implies that the Levitical priesthood
was <u>deficient</u> and the new one <u>better</u>. He reasons similarly from
statements in Psalm <b>40</b>:6-8 about dissatisfaction with <u>Mosaic</u> <b>sacrifices</b>,
concluding that they were <u>ineffective</u>, hence <u>temporary</u>, and in
turn <u>replaced</u> by what they at best only foreshadowed as the <u>permanent</u>
and <u>final</u> answer to the sin problem. By implication the <b>temple</b> in
which temporary priests offered ineffective sacrifices could itself be only a
passing feature of the divine economy. The same thing happens with the <b>covenant</b>
itself as per Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34. A <u>new</u> covenant must mean a <u>different</u>
covenant as well as a different <u>kind</u> of covenant. The first one must be <u>annulled</u>
and <u>replaced</u> by the second because two covenants cannot govern the same
constituency simultaneously. The second covenant differs in kind, better in
quality, and effective for the forgiveness of sin (<b>31</b>:34); its personal
sacrifice is effective for removing a person’s self-consciousness about his
sinfulness (Psalm <b>40</b>:6-8), and the Melchizedekian priest is a better
mediator between sinful people and a holy God (Psalm <b>110</b>:4).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                (4) The Hebrew writer makes his
observations also <u>from cues within the texts themselves</u> that certain
comparisons are appropriate. The parallels are not made allegorically via the
resourcefulness of the Hebrew writer or even his inspiration, but on the basis
of the fact that the texts themselves <u>say</u> parallels exist. The
wilderness wanderings correlate with Christian life and hope as based on Psalm<b>
95</b>. Melchizedek and Messiah correlate as based on Psalm <b>110</b>:4 +
Genesis<b> 14</b>:18-20. Isaiah’s children and the Messiah’s brothers are
comparable in being humans <i>vs</i>. angels, because Isaiah’s children <i>“were
for signs and wonders”</i> in the Emmanuel chapters of Isaiah (Isaiah <b>8</b>:18).
Coupled with express content, necessary inference, and observed fulfillment,
these cues within the texts yield legitimate commentary in the hands of the
Hebrew writer. In fact, every major point he makes is based on an Old Testament
text.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Now to deal with one case for
illustrative purposes. The first instance where Hebrews does something
surprising with the Old Testament occurs almost immediately in chapter 1. In
verse 5b the author cites 2 Samuel <b>7</b>:14 as a reference to the Son of God
despite the fact that the original setting recounts God’s promise to David that
his seed would build the temple that he himself had wanted to build—an
aspiration fulfilled by David’s son Solomon. The first three chapters of
Hebrews emphasize the superiority of the “<u>Son</u> of God” (<b>1</b>:2, <u>4</u>,
5, 8; <b>3</b>:3-<u>6</u>; <b>4</b>:14) over angels as <u>ministers</u> (1-2; <b>1</b>:7,
14) and over Moses as <u>servant</u> (<b>3</b>; 3:5). The introduction to
Hebrews centers on the word <i>Son</i> (<b>1</b>:1-4). Immediately after this
opening sentence, the writer couples Psalm <b>2</b>:7 (<i>“You are my Son”</i>)
with 2 Samuel<b> 7</b>:14 (<i>“I will be his Father and he will be my son”</i>)
and other texts (Deuteronomy <b>32</b>:43 Septuagint [LXX]; Psalm <b>95</b>:6-7;
<b>102</b>:25-27; <b>110</b>:1) to show that the Messianic Son is superior to
angels (Deuteronomy <b>32</b>:43 Septuagint [LXX]; Psalm <b>104</b>:4). He does
not explain how these references relate respectively to the Son or to angels,
nor does he show how they contribute to his argument that the Son is superior
to the angels. He either leaves that for the reader to figure out or he assumes
it as common ground with his original audience. It remains for us to work out
the connections that verify the relevance of his citations and the exegetical
validity of his argument.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Even though an initial reading of that
original context in 2 Samuel might lead a person to suppose it was referring to
Solomon (cp. 1 Chronicles <b>17</b>:13; <b>22</b>:10), upon closer examination
anyone can see that there is more to it than that. 2 Samuel <b>7</b>:13-14a
must refer to Solomon, of course, because Solomon himself understood it that
way (1 Kings <b>6</b>:11-13; <b>8</b>:17-21). The context cannot refer just to
Messiah because God promises to discipline “him” if he sins (<b>7</b>:14b). But
it must refer to more than Solomon since it is an (1) <u>eternal</u> seed that
contrasts with that of Saul (2 Samuel <b>7</b>:15-16). God will discipline
“him” rather than take away his loving kindness from “him” as he had done
earlier with Saul. Consequently, in 2 Samuel <b>7</b> “seed” envisions the
Davidic dynasty; it does not refer just to Solomon—or Messiah, for that matter.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                One background observation is important:
by the nature of the case there can be only one universal eternal kingdom. A
universal eternal kingdom is prophesied in Daniel <b>2</b>:35 (universal) + 44
(eternal) and in Psalm <b>89</b>:27 + 4, 36. Therefore the <u>universal eternal</u>
kingdom of Psalm <b>2</b> (the first quotation in Hebrews 1) and the eternal
kingdom of Psalm <b>110</b> (the last quotation in Hebrews 1) must refer to the
same thing as the <u>eternal</u> kingdom of 2 Samuel <b>7</b>:16 (as well as
Psalm<b> 89</b>; Isaiah <b>9</b>:6-7, <i>etc</i>.). Furthermore, the Daniel <b>2</b>
prediction describes the universal eternal kingdom as made “without hands”
(Daniel<b> 2</b>:34, 45), which means “from/by God” (cp. <b>8</b>:25). This
unique Old Testament expression in Daniel together with its context is probably
in the Hebrew writer’s mind, because he uses this relatively rare terminology
elsewhere in his own book (<b>9</b>:11, 24; cp. Mark <b>14</b>:58; Acts <b>7</b>:48;
<b>17</b>:24; 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:1; Ephesians<b> 2</b>:11; Colossians <b>2</b>:11).
If Psalms and Daniel <b>2</b> are Messianic, then 2 Samuel <b>7</b> must have
Messianic connections as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                (2) <u>Seed</u> is a collective term
for the whole Davidic dynasty as a series, rather than an individual reference
to Solomon. All the third person singulars in 2 Samuel <b>7</b> are grammatical
consequents of the antecedent word <u>seed</u> in <b>7</b>:12. <i>He</i>, <i>his</i>,
and <i>him</i> are grammatically third-person singulars referring back to the
collective noun <u>seed</u> (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>זֶרַע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
dir=LTR></span>, <i>zera‘</i>, mas), rather than to “he,” as in Solomon. Substituting
the word <i>seed</i> for each of the third-person pronouns after <b>7</b>:12
clarifies the broader force of the original Hebrew, a nuance lost in
translation by the requirements of English pronoun idiom. In confirmation of
these observations, Psalm <b>89</b>:29-30ff., which parallels 2 Samuel <b>7</b>,
interprets “seed” as descendants. The successive descendants of David in turn
fill the slot called “seed,” Messiah being the son <i>par excellence</i>. The
“seed” in the person of Solomon did build the first temple (<b>7</b>:13); the
Seed in the person of Messiah built the last temple “without hands” (John <b>2</b>:13-22;
cp. Matthew <b>26</b>:61 = Mark <b>14</b>:58; Matthew <b>27</b>:40 = Mark <b>15</b>:29;
Acts <b>6</b>:13-14; note also <b>24</b>:12; <b>25</b>:8?). The writer’s
approach so far is exegetical; the meaning derives from the Old Testament text
by normal principles of interpretation. The approach takes 2 Samuel <b>7</b>:14
as a class prediction rather than as an allegory, double-reference prophecy,
type-antitype, accommodation, or the like. 2 Samuel<b> 7</b> does include
Messiah in its purview.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                It remains to be shown how that text
relates to an argument for the superiority of the Son over angels. If “son” in
2 Samuel refers to the Davidic dynasty, comprised virtually entirely of mere
mortals, the reader of Hebrews might still question the relevance of this
evidence to the claim that the title <i>son</i> correlates with Messiah’s
superiority over “angels.” <u>Solomon</u> would also be superior to angels in
that case. Some interpreters have in fact entertained the idea that eventually
human beings will rise to a status higher than that of angels: <i>“Don’t you
know that we will <u>judge</u> angels?”</i> Paul says (1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:3).
Angels are <i>“ministering spirits sent to <u>serve</u> the heirs of salvation”</i>
(Hebrews<b> 1</b>:14). Mankind was <i>“made a little-</i>[<u>while</u>? </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>βραχύ</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>brachy</i>]
<i>lower than the angels”</i> (Psalm <b>8</b>:5 + Hebrews<b> 2</b>:7).
Nevertheless, Peter comments that angels are more powerful than humans (2 Peter<b>
2</b>:11); so the proposal about their future inferiority to mankind is moot if
not doubtful. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Another approach seems preferable even
though it is more complex and subtle. The primary basis for arguing the
superiority of the Son over angels really lies in Psalm<b> 2</b>:7, the
immediately preceding citation in Hebrews <b>1</b>. 2 Samuel <b>7</b>:14, where
the theocratic king line is called <i>son of God</i>, is then added in
confirmation, reducing the need for the second citation to serve as primary
evidence. The crux of the issue, however, is that the theocratic king could be
called “son of God” by virtue of the descendant Son, not the other way around.
Jesus was not son of God because of a lineage that led down from David, the son
of God; rather, David could be called “son of God” because his lineage led up
to Messiah, the Son of God. David and his lineage got their title metonymically
from Messiah, not <i>vice versa</i>. According to the flesh, Messiah did
descend from David, but by natural rank he was David’s Lord (Psalm <b>110</b>:4
+ Matthew <b>22</b>:41-45). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                The <u>descriptive title</u> <i>son</i>
lies most basically in Messiah, whose designation is applied by extension to his
dynastic predecessors. For this reason as well as others, Old Testament
scriptures could speak of the monarch of Israel as the <i>son of God</i>
without ascribing deity to him or in any way saying something inappropriate
(note John <b>5</b>:18; <b>10</b>:30-33; <b>19</b>:7). The <u>actual rank</u>
of Messiah over angels is indicated by (a) the actions of angels toward him:
worship (Deuteronomy <b>32</b>:34/Hebrews <b>1</b>:6); by (b) direct statements
about his eternal rank above others (Hebrews<b> 1</b>:7-9 &lt; Psalm<b> 95</b>:6-7;
Hebrews <b>1</b>:13 &lt; Psalm <b>110</b>:1); and by (c) the different
activities assigned to each: the Son’s creating (Hebrews <b>1</b>:10-12 &lt;
Psalm <b>102</b>: 25-27) <i>vs.</i> the angels’ ministering (Hebrews <b>1</b>:7
&lt; Psalm <b>94</b>:4). </span></p>
