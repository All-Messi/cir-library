majority of New Testament writings are letters, so we expect them to reflect
practices in first-century letter writing. One custom was using an amanuensis,
a stenographer who wrote down the contents. Biblical studies do not give this
factor much attention even though New Testament writers used amanuenses. The
oversight seems unusual to us today since most of us in the Western world write
our own correspondence. If we do employ a secretary, it is primarily for computer
skills. We are accustomed to reproducing by typeset, copiers, or computer
printers. But ancient writers had to use different methods. If the work of an
amanuensis can impact New Testament studies, we should allow that to affect our
thinking where appropriate.</span></p>

remarks in his own handwriting and date it. The scribe could be a stenographer,
who took down dictation verbatim from the author. Depending on the skills of
the amanuensis and practical factors in the situation, he could have had a
broader role in producing the work. In his oft-cited German classic on the
papyri, O. Roller expressed the opinion that verbatim dictation was not the
normal way an amanuensis worked, although others dispute this view.<span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Amanuensis work is extensive in the New
Testament. 2 Thessalonians <b>3</b>:17 indicates that Paul regularly closed his
letters with a specimen of his own handwriting, which implies that an
amanuensis penned the body of his letters. In Romans<b> 16</b>:22, Tertius the
scribe names himself and includes a first-person comment, which is unique among
extant letters (Windisch, <i>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</i>, <b>I</b>:501).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:21 and
Colossians <b>4</b>:18 say that Paul wrote the concluding salutation. Galatians
<b>6</b>:11 implies that the material through <b>6</b>:10 was written by a
scribe: <i>“See with what big letters I have written to you with my own hand.” “Big
letters”</i> (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>πηλίκοις</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>γράμμασιν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>) is not likely to mean “a long letter” so as to
indicate that the apostle himself penned the whole (hence, </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἔγραψα</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>is an epistolary aorist?).
Philemon 19 says, <i>“I write it with my own hand:</i> <i>‘I will repay it.’”</i>
Since the comment appears midway through the letter, Paul may have scribed all
this short letter, although he may have taken the pen from the amanuensis and
inserted that pledge in his own handwriting. 1 Peter <b>5</b>:12 shows that
Peter also used an amanuensis, in this case Silvanus. In the Old Testament,
Baruch served as scribe for Jeremiah (Jeremiah <b>36</b>; <b>45</b>:1).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Less certain is the extent to which
having an amanuensis q<u>ualifies the validity of style studies as bases for evauating
traditional authorship</u>. What happens if Paul used more than one scribe in
his letters or wrote most of them with an amanuensis but some in his own hand? How
much difference would that create between the letters? The options for using a
scribe go all the way from word-for-word dictation (stenographer) to simply
giving a line of thought and leaving the amanuensis responsible for generating
the verbal expression of the letter (co-author). Since the New Testament
letters involve complex material about important themes, the essential author
would presumably have originated the structure and subject matter in each book.
Literary patterns like parallelism, ring composition, or chiasmus would
presumably come from him.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> Scribal
input would mostly affect the verbal and grammatical levels rather than the
structural and material ones.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Some factors would increase the
likelihood that New Testament amanuenses did more than take dictation. <b>(a) </b>Tertius’
statement in Romans shows that Paul gave him a certain amount of freedom. <b>(b)</b>
From the two known examples—Tertius and Silvanus, we infer that New Testament
amanuenses were fellow Christians instead of professional scribes; so they
could enter into the process more creatively. <b>(c) </b>Paul especially was an
activist, which suggests that he might concern himself with process more than
detail, content more than wording. <b>(d)</b> New Testament writers seem not to
have been as concerned as we are about exact wording, which again increases the
possibility for scribal influence on words and grammar. Even New Testament
quotations of the Old Testament and sub-apostolic quotations of the New
Testament are more by sense than exact wording. Parallel accounts of Jesus’ teaching
material are not exact. We can say the same for the common material between Jude
and 2 Peter. The speeches in Acts are surely gists of the actual
presentations.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Paul did not use an amanuensis
because he was uneducated or could not write well, but because it seemed more
natural.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> Ancient cultures
were more oral than ours, and rhetoric was first an oral art, with written communication
deriving from oral. An itinerant evangelist like Paul would use a scribe out of
the habit of oral delivery. He could concentrate on what he was saying without
the added concern of the writing itself. While the scribe was putting down what
he had just said, he could be arranging his next thought, much like speakers
who work through an interpreter in a “lining out” format as opposed to “running
translation.”<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There are several places where an
amanuensis involvement may relate to style of writing. <b>(1)</b> Many have
wondered how James, Jude, and the Petrine epistles could exhibit such good
Greek if they were written by Galileans. <b>(2) </b>Using different amanuenses might
explain the divergent styles of 1 and 2 Peter. Early Christian writers speak of
Mark as Peter’s interpreter, so allowing a scribe rather free reign in written
work would not be surprising. <b>(3) </b>There is an unmistakable difference in
style between Revelation and the other Johannine writings. Since John was on
Patmos when he wrote Revelation (<b>1</b>:9), he may not have had an amanuensis
to assist him in reworking his manner of expression as he did in his gospel and
letters. <b>(4)</b> The use of a different amanuensis for the pastorals may
combine with other factors to explain stylistic differences some scholars have
seen between them and earlier Pauline epistles.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <b>(5)</b> Could an amanuensis have
been among the factors that answer the Hebrews mystery? Perhaps Luther’s
suggestion that Apollos the Alexandrian wrote it could combine with the
Alexandrian tradition of Pauline authorship. Apollos, an eloquent man (Acts <b>18</b>:24),
may have had freer reign than normal in making an appeal to Jewish Christians
to remain faithful despite the prospect of persecution for their faith. If Luke
collaborated with Paul, maybe that is the reason for stylistic affinities some
have noted between Hebrews and Luke-Acts. (See Donald Guthrie, <i>New Testament
Introduction</i>, 677.)<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> Barnabas
was well-suited in personality for this endeavor as well. Any of the men in
Paul’s circle may have taken notes on presentations they heard him make and
later have written them up much as a student may take notes and afterwards
write them up in full; in this case he would also have adapted them to the needs
of this audience. Under such scenarios Origen’s famous opinion might be
incisive: the ideas in Hebrews are admirable like those of the apostle’s, but
the phraseology belongs to someone relating Paul’s comments (“who wrote”).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> With Hebrews and 2 Peter, amanuensis
starts sliding over into co-authorship and deutero-authorship.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  It is passing strange that ancient Christians,
for whom Greek was their native language, did not make much of style questions.
Modern negative critics are the ones who question the traditional authorship of
books that seem to them to differ stylistically in marked degrees. Is the
problem that modern scholars unnaturally restrict the range of style an author
could use in that second language? Or did the ancients allow for scribal
effects on style because in their culture amanuenses took part in such efforts?
Or did their Christian commitment simply blind them to these differences?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We are not inclined to push the
effect of an amanuensis on style, since (a) Paul’s various letters—including
the pastorals—do not show highly divergent styles even though some may have
been written by his own hand (Philemon?) and various scribes could have penned
the others. Happily, modern scholarship is pulling back from extreme negative
criticism against traditional authorship on stylistic grounds; so the issue is
not so urgent as it once was. (b) Early Christian writers did not appeal to
amanuenses as a factor that would affect style even when they did notice the
difference—as in Hebrews notably.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The use of amanuenses <u>could
include redaction activity on New Testament writings</u>. <b>(a)</b> There seem
to have been several <u>recensions of Romans</u>. Different placements of the
doxology (<b>16</b>:25-27) and benediction (<b>16</b>:20b) imply some early
source of textual variation. There were evidently copies of the book without
chapter <b>16</b> and without chapters <b>15-16</b>. Someone like Tertius could
have made copies of Romans as circulating summaries of the gospel. That could
explain omitting <i>in Rome</i> (<b>1</b>:7, 15) in a few manuscripts. <b>(b)</b>
If 2 Corinthians is really a conflation of two letters (<b>1-9</b> and <b>10-13</b>),
Paul or his amanuensis could have spliced the two together later for some
practical reason. <b>(c)</b> Since there were at least three house churches in
Rome (<b>16</b>:5, 14, 15), the Roman letter may have been copied for each of
the worshiping units. The same could be said for all the letters that were sent
to metropolitan centers with more than one house church. <b>(d) </b>The <i>Letter
to the Laodecians</i> may be our Ephesians, which could relate to the loss of <i>in
Ephesus</i> (<b>1</b>:1) in a few manuscripts. Perhaps it circulated throughout
Asia like the Apocalypse. At Paul’s request, the amanuensis could have made copies
for several congregations. <b>(e)</b> When Paul, Silas, and Timothy toured the
Gentile churches on the second journey, they delivered copies of the <u>Jerusalem
“decree</u>” (Acts <b>16</b>:4; cp. <b>15</b>:19-31). Producing these copies
would have been a natural responsibility for an amanuensis.</span></p>

explanations for how Paul’s letters came to be one body of writing.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> Using an amanuensis <u>raises an
option for the collection and selection of the Pauline corpus for canonical
purposes</u>. One responsibility could have been duplicating the letter as a
record of correspondence or as a backup copy in case the original was destroyed
or lost. We wonder whether that possibility lies behind Paul’s statement to
Timothy (2 Timothy <b>4</b>:13) about bringing him the books (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>βιβλία</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>)
and the parchments (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>μεμβράνας</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>). Were the parchments blank writing materials Paul
wanted to use to make more durable copies of his writings now that his own
death was looming near? Were the “books” copies of his earlier writings, or
were they just part of his “library”? Why did Timothy have these books and
parchments that apparently belonged to Paul? Was he Paul’s main amanuensis?
This last question might explain the presence of his name in the headings of
six of Paul’s letters, although we doubt it.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>9</span> At any rate, with the aid of his amanuenses and other
co-workers, Paul could have made a <u>collection</u> of his own epistles as he
wrote them.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Besides collecting his letters,
there was surely a <u>selection</u> process as well. Unless the Letter to the
Laodecians is the Book of Ephesians (Colossians <b>4</b>:16), at least one letter
of Paul has been lost. 1 Corinthians <b>5</b>:9-13 is often taken as a
reference to an earlier letter to Corinth. In 2 Thessalonians <b>3</b>:17 Paul
demonstrated what his handwriting looked like: <i>“This is the way I write”</i>;
this was his “sign” in every letter. At most, 2 Thessalonians is only the third
extant letter of Paul by that time. Since he had already been preaching for
many years, he undoubtedly had authored more than three communications.&nbsp;Perhaps
among the amanuenses’ copies, he himself selected those that would best serve
the needs of the churches after his approaching death, a concern the Apostle
Peter also felt (2 Peter <b>1</b>:12-15).</span></p>

range of constructs possible within “God-breathedness</u>.” Instead of always
having a positive role that originated terms, style, and ideas, the Spirit more
likely served a protective and confirmatory role in the production of what had
a significant aspect of human generation of ideas and ways of expressing them
(manner of inspiration). To have a wholly reliable text, the Holy Spirit need
not have dictated the letters since the human authors themselves dictated many
of the biblical writings to scribes. Even the scribe could have materially
affected the terminology and grammatical expression of ideas. Our view of
inerrancy should not hinge on a mechanism that requires verbal dictation. Inspiration
is a protective and restrictive process rather than a purely positive one.</span></p>

scribes, but fellow workers who were believers. Tertius greeted the Romans “in
the Lord” (Romans <b>16</b>:22); Silvanus was a “faithful brother” (1 Peter <b>5</b>:12).
Such men would qualify as “apostolic” in the canonical usage of that term
because they worked in the apostolic circle as extensions of the apostolic
office. (b) The author would have read over the finished product before giving
it his approval. Anything unacceptable would have been corrected before it was
sent out. Furthermore, (c) inspiration deals with the intended <u>content</u>
of scripture-as-such, not with particular matters of <u>form</u> like
phraseology, vocabulary, or grammar that may have come from the amanuensis.<span

modern languages and from the original Aramaic/Hebrew proclamation to the Greek
text of the New Testament. There are also (4) cross-cultural differences
between biblical settings and our own along with (5) textual-transmission
errors, both of which are aggravated by the (6) time factor between text and
interpreter. Under these circumstances fine nuances that are dependent on exact
terminology and phraseology are less likely to match the level of the author’s

rewritten the letter after taking initial dictation perhaps in shorthand,
polishing its expression in the process. It may have been his job to make a
second copy for the author’s records, to make multiple copies that could serve
as encyclicals, and even to adapt previous writings to secondary usages. The
use of amanuenses could have implications (1) for style studies as they impact questions
about <u>authorship</u>, (2) for the collection of the Pauline corpus as one
step in the formation of the <u>canon</u>, and (3) for certain aspects of
redaction criticism on the <u>unity</u> of books and questions about their <u>textual
integrity</u>. Using an amanuensis would be a culturally relevant way of
bringing these activities more directly under apostolic supervision in contrast
to unguided eventuation.</span></p>

exercise like this one is to encourage believers to remember relevant factors
like the use of amanuenses when working out explanations for phenomena of the
biblical text. Such an approach contrasts with postulating scenarios that
discredit New Testament writings as reliable records of Christian beginnings
and accurate guides for faith and practice.</span></p>
