<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2 Corinthians <b>6</b>:14-<b>7</b>:1 does
not form the whole of the “previous letter.” It is not a unit that can stand on
its own, so its beginning and end have been removed and then inserted where it
does not fit very well. The reasons for considering these verses an
interpolation are (1) that they do not tie closely to the surrounding context
and (2) that if they are omitted, the flow of thought is smooth enough that a
reader would not notice anything was missing. In relation to the first reason,
we wonder <u>why a redactor would put it in at this point if it does not fit
with the context very well</u>, especially after he had excised it from its
original setting in a fashion that does not form a unit. If a redactor could
insert a paragraph that was loosely connected, an author himself could do the
same thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In relation to the second reason, during a
writing project most of us have misplaced a page with a paragraph on it and
later found it or lost a segment on a computer and without being able to tell
from the resulting writing that something was missing. Besides, we go back into
a document and add in sentences and paragraphs without changing the surrounding
wording. We add them, not because there are obvious holes without them, but
because we thought of other points to include. That a piece of writing flows
well without a segment hardly shows that the segment was not part of the
original.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Something of the same thing goes for 2
Corinthians <b>10-13</b> as a portion of the so-called “sorrowful letter.” In
this case, there are some other considerations. What else comes from supposing
that <b>10-13</b> is part of a lost “severe letter”? 2 Corinthians is not
likely to have ended after chapter <b>9</b>, so something has been deleted or
at least shoved apart for the insertion of the “severe letter.” The materials
in 2 Corinthians <b>10-13 </b>do not form a unit either. The front must have
been chopped off. The end of either the “severe letter” or 2 Corinthians must
have been omitted, because 2 Corinthians does not now seem to have two
conflated conclusions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The likelihood of such a process—especially being able
to detect it later—readers must judge for themselves, but it seems rather uncertain.</span></p>
