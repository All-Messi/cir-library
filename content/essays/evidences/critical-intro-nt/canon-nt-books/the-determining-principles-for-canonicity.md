<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In keeping with the structure of
apologetics, the following sketch deals with the principles for determining whether
a writing belongs in the Judaeo-Christian canon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:6.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The <u>historical principle</u> comes
logically first because canonicity has first to do with (5) <u>where</u> the
book came from, which means who wrote it and where he got his information. Behind
this step lies the concern about (4) <u>how</u> people recognized divine
spokesmen and distinguished them from false claimants. The question rests on
the observation that God’s breaking into the world through special revelation
always, by definition and the nature of the case, involves (3) <u>miracle</u>. Even
the prophets themselves must be able to distinguish divine revelation from their
own thoughts. The next step is (2) the distinction between <u>divine</u>
miracle that confirms revelation and other phenomena like demonic miracle, deception,
parapsychological phenomena, misidentified natural occurrences. This
distinction is most decisively made by (1) the <u>triumph of the divine</u> in
confrontation with alternatives: the “resurrection” of Israel from Egypt (and
attendant events) for the Old Testament and the resurrection of Messiah from
the grave in the New Testament serve as prime examples. These are historical
considerations because biblical revelation is a historical (<i>vs</i>.
metaphysical) construct. The historical principle determines canonicity by
giving us the right books in the first place; it is positive. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The <u>doctrinal principle</u>
determines canonicity by eliminating additional books that do not harmonize
with previous revelation. Any writing that contains material contradictory to
previous revelation is false and non-canonical, not only in some matter at
issue but as a whole. It has no status among God’s people even if it propounds
new teachings that do <u>not</u> contradict previous revelation. The doctrinal
principle stops the wrong new books from coming into the Christian canon; it is
restrictive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The <u>subjective principle</u>
confirms in personal experience the objective claims and promises of
revelation. That sense of truthfulness refers to <i>“the ring of truth.”</i> It
speaks to people’s needs and finds acceptance there. The <i>“ring of truth” </i>is
probably what many people mean when they speak of <i>“the inner witness of the
Spirit”</i> (Romans <b>8</b>:14). In the present view, the sense of
trustworthiness does not come from a direct, supernatural operation on a person
by the Spirit parallel to the proclamation of the message. Rather, it is a
natural experience anyone may have even in matters not distinctively Christian
or even religious. It is the intuitive recognition of the correlation between
answer received and need felt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Other principles, set aside in this
treatment, have been put forward by writers from a range of theological
persuasions: antiquity of the writing, written in the Hebrew/Aramaic language,
and so on. The three above, however, are deemed sufficient for explaining the
mechanics of canonization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The accompanying diagram indicates the
relationship between the structure of apologetics and the principles of
canonicity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Canonicity focuses on the objective history out of
which doctrine arises and then flows to the subjective side, where it strikes a
sympathetic chord in the needing heart (cp. 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:24-25).    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The present set and sequence of canonical
principles differ from some approaches to canonicity in number and order. Particularly
is it common to <b>(A)</b> put the doctrinal principle in the primary position.
Luther may serve as an example in his dictum that those books are authoritative
which “preach Christ.” (Luther may have meant this more as a hermeneutical
guide than a canonical principle, however.) Three deficiencies lie in such a
suggestion. (1) The doctrinal principle cannot deal adequately with <u>new</u>
doctrine. It can only be restrictive; it can invalidate only false doctrines
that contradict previous revelation. It cannot safeguard against false
teachings that do not do so. (2) It cannot identify the original body of
literature that determines the doctrinal criteria without becoming circular
reasoning. The problem is insoluble as to why, for example, what preaches
Christ should have authority. (3) Putting the doctrinal principle in first
place creates a canon within a canon. Not much preaching about Christ occurs in
Job, Haggai, Esther, or the Song of Solomon. Such books would fall back into
secondary position of authority (deutero-canonical), and their contents would become
negotiable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Another view <b>(B)</b> makes the
subjective principle primary and decisive. Because of human depravity,
unbelievers supposedly cannot recognize truth until a secret operation of the
Spirit occurs parallel to the message. For God’s people, it is simply a mystery
(unknowable) how God implants the conviction about canonicity in the hearts of
the elect. The idea confuses objective with subjective. Canonicity has an
objective role, but this subjectivism says little about canonicity. While we
would not claim complete awareness of the inner workings of people’s minds and
hearts in this matter, we can surely say something true about the process
objectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  As a primary principle, <i>“ring of
truth”</i> is inadequate for a couple reasons. What has impact may not be
something that should have impact [B], and what does not have impact </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in'><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                 <img
width=156 height=87 src="/cir-library/images/essays/the-determining-principles-for-canonicity/image003.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:6.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>may be something that should [A<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span>]. True religious material—and therefore the
written presentation of it—does correlate with people’s real needs and so has
impact to some degree and in some respects [A<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span>].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  One comment is useful regarding
canonicity and a hearer’s conviction about Christian truth. The need-answer-use
triangle shown above applies to all matters on which a person comes to belief
(apologetics). So, it is appropriate to say that the convincing process can
begin anywhere in the triangle, and the movement from one to the other can go
in either direction. People who hear the message may come to believe it in
other than the best way; but as time goes on, their “growth” in the faith will
strengthen as the other parts of the triangle come into play. See articles in
these cite form about “Apologetics.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Before leaving this subject, we
should deal with two assumptions that underlie critical introduction and
canonicity in this presentation. With miracle in decisive position, <b>(a)</b> <u>miracle
by a false prophet</u> would be confusing. The assumption is that false
teachers cannot do real miracles by divine power. They cannot do supernatural
things unless the Supernatural enables them (cp. John <b>3</b>:2). God does not
enable false teachers to do miracles, as Jesus implies when he says that no one
can do a mighty work in his name and soon speak evil of him (Mark<b> 9</b>:39).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Likewise, <b>(b) </b>if <u>demonic power</u>
can produce miracle among false prophets, then divine and demonic miracle must
be distinguishable. We suggest that demonic miracle itself does not have
positive value and that in the case of negative (destructive) value, the divine
triumphs over the demonic in confrontation. Elijah over the Baal prophets illustrates
the principle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Finally, <b>(c) </b>the present
scheme suggests a problem. On the one hand, we have said that miracle confirms
revelation about doctrine (Mark <b>2</b>:1-12; note John<b> 3</b>:2; <b>20</b>:30-31).
On the other hand, we have applied the doctrinal test to judge the canonicity
of a prophet’s writing (Deuteronomy <b>13</b>:1-5). Moses subordinated signs to
doctrine in the Deuteronomy passage. A prophet who gave a sign that came to
pass (miracle, chance occurrence, “lying wonders”) was nevertheless executed if
he urged people on that basis to serve other gods (doctrine; Deuteronomy <b>13</b>:1-5).
<u>Miracle proves doctrine and doctrine tests miracle</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The problem poses a <u>false dilemma</u>
because the doctrine proved by stupendous miracle is not the same doctrine that
judges miracle. (1) Miracle authenticates doctrine. (2) That doctrine, in turn,
tests any miracles used to authenticate further doctrine that contradicts             </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                      <img width=316 height=83
src="/cir-library/images/essays/the-determining-principles-for-canonicity/image004.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>previous teaching. In the beginning, God attested the
message of Moses by stupendous demonstration of miracle in the triumph of
divine over demonic and human in confrontation. As revelation progressively
unveiled further truth, it was miraculously attested; but any prophet was cut
off who sought to contradict previous revelation by displaying lying wonders
(demonic, deceptive, or otherwise); no message from God stands at odds with previous
messages from him. The “miracle” was not divine miracle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Miracle and doctrine are not
individually absolute tests because a <u>miracle</u> may not always be obviously
a divine miracle rather than something else. Furthermore, <u>doctrine</u> is
not always decisive because observants may not correctly understand the
doctrine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Besides the false-dilemma, signs may
have varying degrees of obviousness that they are divinely supernatural. Even
though it is not the same miracle that tests doctrine that is tested by
doctrine, there is a question about the <u>relative ambiguity of miracle as
such</u>. At this more general level, we can appeal to <b>(a) </b>stupendous
miracle (greater degree) and <b>(b)</b> divine miracle <b>(c)</b> in
confrontation. We may be inclined to consider the case in Deuteronomy <b>13</b>
as the <u>same</u> doctrinal point, that is, <i>“Who is God?” </i>In this case,
a more stupendous display of divine supernatural manifestation had earlier
occurred in confrontation with some of the very gods that a “dreamer of dreams”
or “prophet” would propose to serve. These gods were the ones that Yahveh had
overwhelmingly defeated in the exodus; and the gods of Canaan were likewise
going to be overwhelmingly defeated in the conquest. Those previous and future
confrontations were significantly more obvious than any sign some “dreamer” could
offer. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The original stupendous divine miracle
in confrontation was the exodus-conquest, reaffirmed in lesser displays
throughout Israel’s history. The next stupendous miracle in confrontation was
the resurrection plus Gentile mission. Jesus’ ministry multiplied preliminary
miracles that culminated in his bodily resurrection and was perpetuated in the
Pentecostal display and in the miraculous confirmation demonstrated through the
apostolic witnesses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There is also the issue of relative
certainty. People take positions on what makes the best case more than on what
offers absolute certainty, has no ambiguity, or presents no difficulties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  As with most considerations, more
than one principle operates in canonicity, and one is decisive while others
play important secondary roles. The original decision on canonicity is by now a
matter of record; students today no longer have access to much of the historical
information used then. Nevertheless, as a discipline, the principles involved in
canonization are historical, doctrinal, and subjective in that descending
order. They combine to establish what books comprise the canon, that is, which
ones have authority and are normative for faith. Canonicity and normativeness
correlate with God-breathedness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In summary, two <u>theoretical
problems</u> are involved in the interaction of doctrine and miracle. The first
is how we avoid circularity. The answer is that it is not the same doctrine
that checks miracle that is proved by miracle. The second is how we get the
original body of literature to check miracle by. The answer is to look for stupendous
triumph in confrontation with opponents of God when God promised success in
that confrontation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There are also two <u>practical
problems</u> in applying the doctrinal test. The first is what to do when no
previous revelation exists on a given doctrine. The answer is that we must
supplement the doctrinal test with the success test, the moral test, the
definitional test, and the kind-of-miracle test. The second is how to avoid
missing the truth on something that erroneously strikes us as false. The answer
lies in a willingness to listen. The doctrinal test assumes correct doctrinal
understanding by the “tester.” The miracle test assumes the correct
identification of an event as divinely supernatural.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     Additions to the Basic Canonical Principles</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The previous schematic does not deal
with books written by authenticated men that did not become part of the canon. Paul,
David, Isaiah may have written some things not in the canon. Unless we assume
that everything a prophet wrote became canonized, we must consider how it was
decided which ones belonged. The principles on the previous pages apply to
canonicity in the first sense—in the <u>theoretical</u> sense (inspiration). Other
factors apply to canonicity in this <u>historical</u> sense, the later formal
sense (providence).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Perhaps some books were not
preserved because they did not have lasting, universal significance. Such a
point does not account for 2 and 3 John, although it might account for the
preservation of Philemon because it addressed a prevalent problem for Christians
in the ancient world: the slavery issue. Though short and relatively private,
Philemon dealt with a recurring issue of general interest and importance. An
example of a localized problem might be some understandings of <i>“baptism for
the dead”</i> (1 Corinthians<b> 15</b>:29). Such a parochial matter might
confuse later readers in different situations who have no access to the
original circumstance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The apostle or prophet may not have conceived
of certain writings as having canonical value and so did not encourage their
use and circulation. If Luke, for example, collected the Pauline corpus, the apostle
could oversee the selection process. Perhaps Luke was responsible for the whole
canonical collection because he knew there were <i>“many who [had] taken in
hand to draw up a narrative” </i>about the ministry of Jesus (Luke <b>1</b>:1-4).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We may invoke a restrictive notion
here since some New Testament books could be omitted without loss. In the case
of those that could be kept or not, God would let it go either way historically.
In the case of any that should <u>not</u> be kept as scripture, he saw to it
that they were not kept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Paul took care of the churches’
needs by (1) establishing resident leadership, (2) gifting them with spiritual
gifts, and (3) sending various assistants to deal with practical matters. These
lesser means could meet the needs of the congregations. Consequently, there may
have been less need for (4) more private, parochial correspondence that would
then have been preserved as canonical. Preserving such literature would magnify
the problem of implied cultural limitation, which modern readers already face regarding
meat offered to idols, veil wearing, female deference, slavery, eating blood, table
fellowship, dress code. It would also multiply instances of ambiguity on
parochial issues not understandable to generations no longer privy to such situations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  As to the historical impact on
canonicity, we could identify (a) the lack of permanent or universal importance
(<u>limited province</u>) and (b) the lack of additional information (<u>duplicate
content</u>) as contributing to the failure to preserve items that otherwise
met the requirements for canonicity.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>  Irrelevant Factors in Canonicity       </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  For completeness sake, we mention some
matters that do not have anything to do with establishing canonicity. (1) <u>Being
quoted</u>. Citing of books by Old or New Testament authors does not in itself mean
the biblical authors regarded the books cited as inspired. How they use them
must determine canonicity. On the one hand, the New Testament writers cite
non-Christian sources on occasion including the apocrypha, pseudepigrapha,
Greek authors, and early Christian sayings. (See “Sources of the Pauline
Materials.”) Some Old Testament writings refer to sources no longer extant that
would probably not qualify as inspired: “The Acts of Solomon,” “The Chronicles
of the Kings of Judah,” “The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel,” and the like.
(See notes for <i>Critical Introduction to the Old Testament</i>.) On the other
hand, some Old Testament canonical writings are not cited in the New Testament.
Citations can be for illustration (of the current point in other people’s
thinking) instead of authoritative confirmation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (2) <u>Inclusion in manuscripts</u>.
What books a manuscript included may have been determined more by space
considerations than anything else, especially if they appear at the end of the
scroll or codex. Manuscripts of New Testament books may include early Christian
writings from outside the canon. Old Testament manuscripts do the same thing,
which some have considered evidence for the canonicity of the Apocrypha. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (3) <u>Language used</u>. The
biblical message is concerned with content, not with the language chosen for inscripturation.
There is no reason to suppose that canonical literature for the Jews had to be
written in Hebrew rather than in Aramaic or Greek.</span></p>
