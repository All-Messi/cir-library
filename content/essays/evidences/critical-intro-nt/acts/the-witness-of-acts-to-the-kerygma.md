<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Theories
about an evolutionary origin for the Christian religion present a fundamental
line of inquiry. The body of literature called the “New Testament” supposedly
shows stages that process passed through. If the New Testament does not
actually represent the original Christian preaching, what really did comprise
their message, and how can we recover that primitive gospel?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <i>Acts
of Apostles</i>, written after the life of Jesus of Nazareth, presupposes
incidents in his ministry. It purports to be a history of men divinely
appointed to establish a religion based on these incidents. The record of their
“acts” includes accounts of what they said as well. Such a record should prove
valuable in discovering the content of the earliest “preaching,” the <i>kerygma</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
issue of origins calls for inquiring into the ramifications of supposing that
the Christian gospel evolved from people rather than came from God. Next, the
degree of doctrinal consistency of New Testament writers who appear in The Acts
calls for examination. Finally, we can compare the kerygmatic elements in The Acts
with the writings of these messengers to determine the historicity of The Acts’
witness to the <i>keryma</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>       
    We feel free to believe only what is true. When critics cast reflections on
what we believe, we feel a need to look into their reasons for doubt. To
maintain our equilibrium amid challenges to our hope, we must cope with
theories that would destroy its veracity. This study cannot address the whole
New Testament’s witness to the apostolic preaching; so it examines <i>Acts of
Apostles</i> and compares it briefly with epistles of Peter, Paul, and James.</span></p>

the appearance of Jesus in history—his ministry, suffering, and death, and His
subsequent manifestation of Himself to His followers as risen from the dead and
invested with the glory of another world—and the emergence of the Church as a
society distinguished by the power and activity of the Holy Spirit, and looking
forward to the return of its Lord as Judge and Savior of the world.”</span></i><i><sup><span

content of the <i>kerygma</i> consists of events and their significance. Certain

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            If
the Christian gospel arose in evolutionary fashion, we wonder about the
propriety of even talking about <u>the</u> <i>kerygma</i>. What point along the
line of development should we call the <i>kerygma</i>? How original is
original? Besides time, what about place and person? If differences existed
between authors in latter stages, differences could have existed also in
primitive stages. Whether we can call Peter’s or Paul’s preaching <u>a</u> <i>kerygma</i>
may be questionable since these men’s lives spanned several decades. That allows
for their own views to develop. So, what preaching, by whom, at what time in
their lives can be called <u>the</u> <i>kerygma</i>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            To
find the <i>kerygma</i>, scholars attempt to overcome the problem of different
persons’ preaching by using only what is common to more than one New Testament
author. Another technique uses Old Testament prophecies in the earliest
proclamation. The preachers cite those predictions to place significance on
certain events they believed—or at least preached—as occurring in Jesus’ life. Fifteen
prophecies are used in whole or in part by more than one New Testament writer.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>2</span></sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Collecting
Old Testament passages that different authors used to prove a common contention
gives rise to another theory: there were “testimonia” that New Testament
authors used when they wrote—collections of Old Testament passages taken as
Messianic. These may have been used in place of the Old Testament writings
themselves as a basis for preaching the Christian message.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
main evidence for “testimonia” is that Cyprian (death A.D. 258) had just such a
collection later. Secondly, New Testament phenomena lend credence to the
theory: (1) certain passages are quoted by more than one writer; (2) when these
passages are quoted, there are agreements in a reading different from that of
the Septuagint or any other known translation or Hebrew form of the Old
Testament text; (3) certain passages tend to appear in combination in more than
one New Testament writing; (4) groups of passages recur that are connected by a
key word or idea.</span><sup><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>3</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> These evidences become
reasons for assuming that such testimonia existed earlier than Cyprian’s time,
but the chief purpose is to account for the fact that New Testament writers
interpret certain Old Testament passages the same way. Such a reconstruction
attempts to sidestep belief in inspiration as an explanation for the origin of
the Christian message. “Testimonia” account for one fact even as special
sources are postulated to explain common features across the synoptic gospels.</span></p>

God made promises to his people that came to pass hundreds of years later in
his Son. (b) Jesus came into this world and performed certain deeds. (c) These
acts were understood in terms of prophecies about the Messiah. These three
steps by believers are stretched out in the evolutionary hypothesis: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(1)
Centuries of speculation gave rise to a hope among the Israelites that there
would be a Savior for their nation; these convictions were put into written
form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(2)
Jesus of Nazareth was a gifted teacher and leader who, though performing nothing
extraordinary, made such an impression that miracle tales and legends grew up around
his deeds. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(3)
A group of misled disciples began to attach to his deeds those prophecies so
long held dear by Israelites. Those interpretations evolved further until the
promises were collected and arranged systematically for facility in convincing
Jews about Jesus’ Messiahship. Such collections became the reference books for
those who wrote the New Testament, each writer evidencing his own theological
structure atop this common foundation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(4)
Through such activity a society of expanding, theologically evolving believers
developed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            That
process, however, needs too much time to be practical in the short space from
A.D. 30 to approximately A.D. 61, when <i>Acts of Apostles</i> was penned. The
penchant for sources and systems has led theorists to such complexities that,
although individual parts of the schematic seem plausible, the whole is not
persuasive. No amount of extensive evolution can account for the phenomena the
theory tries to explain. The plausibility of any explanation depends on how
well the <u>whole</u> coincides with the facts. In agreement with this
observation is the practice of such scholars to re-date the New Testament books
that have come down to us and put them at a much later time and thereby detach
them from the writers historically identified with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
likelihood of the “testimonia theory” bears examination. Common material in
more than one author can have various explanations; consequently, saying that
the common material constitutes the <i>kerygma</i> is superficial. <b>(1)</b>
Rather than being the <i>kerygma</i>, the common material could be the basis
for everything else and therefore received emphasis appropriate to its importance
in the early preaching. Basic elements would get repeated more frequently, but
that does not necessarily call for their position in the original <i>kerygma</i>
to the exclusion of other parts of the message. <b>(2) </b>Rather than being
the center from which all else radiated, the common matter could represent the
beginning of a later synthesis, since Pauline and Petrine theologies have been
the thesis and antithesis that synthesized in Roman Catholicism. <b>(3)</b> The
further developments built on these facts may also be part of the original
preaching but not stressed so much in The Acts because the elements on which
they were based must first have been accepted; hence, the content of a given
proclamation depends on which rung of the ladder the hearer is standing. When
Paul spoke on the Areopagus, he began with the God unknown to the Athenians
before he announced the resurrection of that God’s Son and the judgment to
come. Peter, speaking on Pentecost, started with Old Testament prophets
accepted by the devout Jews gathered in Jerusalem from every nation under
heaven. At the Conference on Circumcision, James assumes that everyone present
believed that his physical half-brother was the prophesied, crucified, risen,
glorified sovereign of the universe. The stage of the preaching’s development
may be as much determined by the progress of the hearers as by the progress of
the speaker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            From
the emphasis put by liberal theologians on New Testament use of Old Testament
prophecy, they imply that solving the content of the <i>kerygma</i> lies in the
use of the Old Testament. That idea leads to the understanding of fulfillment
prevalent in the primitive church. Then, if fulfillment is understood, the
naturalistic explanation of Christian origins is very near.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
above procedure is not altogether wrong; it just misconstrues the elements of
the process. The mistake comes from supposing that only what is common to the
writers constitutes the <i>kerygma</i>. That assumption grows out of the
further assumption that, because the writers use different language to explain
additional elements, they contradict one another, or that, because one omits
something another adds, they have different theologies. Such theorizing draws
many conclusions about an author’s theology from his emphasis on certain parts
of that theology, forgetting, it seems, that his writings give instruction on
issues pertinent to his readers; they are not position papers for setting forth
his views for the first time. To say that further progress of the preaching appears
in a certain writing or that common material represents original <i>kerygma</i>
disregards time, place, and circumstance.</span></p>

the context of an evolutionary background for the Christian faith, two theories
about <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> undermine its reliability. First are source
theories; second is the speculation that The Acts was written to cover up a
dissension between Peter and Paul. Together these claims subtract from the book
any real historicity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            That
Peter and Paul were in disagreement grows out of Paul’s statement in Galatians <b>2</b>:11ff
about rebuking Peter in Antioch: earlier Peter had separated himself from the
Gentile converts when some Jews arrived, supposedly sent by the Jerusalem
church. That conclusion about divergence in message stands at odds with Peter’s
own words in his second letter: <i>“. . . even as our beloved brother Paul
also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you”</i> (<b>3</b>:15). Some
people Peter was writing to were the same ones addressed by the Galatian
letter. Of course, this combination of texts does not amount to much if a
person denies that Peter wrote the second letter that bears his name. The
dissimulation in Antioch was not about doctrine but about living out its
implications. Peter’s experience in the Cornelius event appears in the same
Book of Acts and shows that Peter understood better than he acted later (Acts <b>10</b>:34-35).
Galatians <b>2</b>:14 itself shows that Paul and Peter did not disagree on the <i>kerygma</i>:

Jews?’” </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span

descension was not about the message but about Peter’s cowardice in not

Greek is said to change from Hebraistic to Hellenistic as the scenes of The Acts

is divided into parts according to whether the scenes are in Greek or Hebrew
territory, it falls into four sections: chapters <b>1-12</b>, <b>13-20</b>, <b>21-26</b>,
<b>27-28</b>. Since written and spoken language may vary greatly, study of
style does well to distinguish narrative and dialogue. So the four divisions
may subdivide further into narrative, Old Testament quotation, discourse, and
speeches. Observations are made on a number-of-words basis. Speeches include
the material in the chart of speeches; Old Testament quotation, since it does
not contribute to an author’s style, is subtracted from the speeches,

is no reason to question the accuracy of The Acts’ witness to the <i>kerygma</i>,
because it agrees with the contents of the epistles written by some of the
speakers in the book.  </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            There
is no reason to suppose that The Acts served to cover over dissension between
Paul and Peter since the elements of the gospel witnessed by these men in the <i>Acts
of the Apostles</i> is true to what we can know of their theologies through their
epistles. If there is some difference between their theologies, that difference
must lie beyond the gospel elements presented in The Acts. Besides, the idea
that there was doctrinal difference between the two apostles just does not
exist in the Galatians <b>2</b> passage that is supposed to be the source of
the claim. As a consequence, the idea that The Acts was written to cover up
that dissension falls out of the picture altogether. There was no such
dissension for the Book of Acts to cover up.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            That
Luke composed the speeches of The Acts is not a necessary conclusion. His style
seems to adjust when he passes from narrative to dialogue. That is normal since
oral speech tends to differ from narration.</span></p>
