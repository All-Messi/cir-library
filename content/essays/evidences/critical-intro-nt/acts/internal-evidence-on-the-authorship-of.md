<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>20</b>:5-15               (5, 6, 7, 8,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>27</b>:1-<b>28</b>:16         (<b>27</b>:1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 18, 20, 27, 29, 37;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The phenomenon begins at Troas (<b>16</b>:10) and
continues through Philippi (<b>16</b>:11-40). “We passages” do not appear in
the subsequent mission south through Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth,
which covers over a year and a half (<b>18</b>:11); nor does the author appear
again during the rest of Paul’s second journey. Not until late in the third
tour do the “we passages” resume—in Macedonia after the Ephesian mission, the
swing north through Macedonia, down to Corinth, and back north to Macedonia. The
next block of verses (<b>20</b>:5-15) covers events in Troas (<b>20</b>:6-12)
and Miletus (<b>20</b>:15-38) as well as the final trip to Jerusalem (<b>20</b>:13-14;
<b>21</b>:1-18). “We” occurs again at the <u>end</u> of the Caesarean
imprisonment (<b>27</b>:1), although it is not certain that the writer stayed
with Paul throughout the arrest in Jerusalem, the transfer to Caesarea, and the
two-year incarceration there. He continues with the apostle on the fateful
voyage to Rome (<b>27</b>:1-<b>28</b>:16), but the text gives no information
about how long he remained with Paul during the next two-year imprisonment (<b>28</b>:30-31).
The “we passages” give positive evidence, not restrictive evidence; that is,
they indicate when the writer <u>was</u> present, but do not necessarily mean
he was absent at other times.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On the assumption that the writer <u>did</u>
stay in Rome, we can get a list of possible authors from the prison letters—particularly
Colossians. Colossians <b>1</b>:1; <b>4</b>:7-14 mention Timothy, Tychicus,
Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, Barnabas, Jesus Justice, Epaphras, Luke, and
Demas. We can set aside some of these names because they appear in the Acts <b>20</b>:3-4
“we section”: Sopater, <u>Aristarchus</u>, Secundus, Gaius, <u>Timothy</u>, <u>Tychicus</u>,
and Trophimus. The underlined names overlap those in Colossians; hence, the ten
reduce to seven; the other four in Acts <b>20</b> fall out as well if by chance
any of them was with Paul, though unmentioned, at the writing of Colossians. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             “We” does not include <u>Mark</u> or <u>Barnabas</u>
because they worked separately from Paul on the second tour (Acts <b>15</b>:37-40),
where the “we passages” begin. <u>Onesimus</u> was not converted till Paul’s
Roman (or Caesarean?) imprisonment (Philemon 10), but the “we passages” go back
earlier. The same observation probably disqualifies <u>Epaphras</u>. He
evidently originated around Colossae (Colossians <b>4</b>:12), an area Paul did
not evangelize until the third journey as presumably part of the Ephesian
mission (Acts <b>19</b>:10; though Paul himself may not have gone there—Colossians<b>
2</b>:1). Again, “we passages” begin earlier than when Epaphras would likely
have met Paul. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Of the remaining three, Demas is least
likely because he <i><u>“forsook</u></i> [Paul]<i>, having loved this present
world”</i> (2 Timothy <b>4</b>:10). Someone dedicated to Paul enough to sail
with him to Rome does not sound like the sort of man that would run off in
difficult times—or whatever was the reason for Demas’ departure. There is not
much to say about Jesus Justus since he is not mentioned elsewhere; so there is
not much to commend him as author either. Luke is most likely because he was a
doctor (Colossians <b>4</b>:14), whose presence with Paul may have been related
to the apostle’s <i>“thorn in the flesh”</i> (2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:7-10).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> Luke’s presence with Paul fits
with the fact that we do not see him among Paul’s circle of workers as one
involved in the ministry of the word. The observation should not be overdone, because
for two hundred years scholars have noted the prominence of medical vocabulary
in Luke-Acts and the interest that the writer shows in healings—particularly in
the gospel. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Up to this point we have tried to identify
an author from names in the prison letters. It is easier to eliminate possibilities
than propose them. <u>No one named in the “we passages”</u> wrote Acts, that is,
Silas, Philip, Trophimus, and so on. Whatever prompted the author to conceal
his identity in the “we passages” would have applied elsewhere too; so <u>no
one from the Pauline circle in Acts</u>—indeed <u>no one named in Acts</u>—wrote
the book. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span>We
do wonder what besides his absence would explain not using first person. The
absence of “we texts” between Macedonia in the second journey and Macedonia
again toward the end of the third journey, could indicate that Luke stayed in
Philippi and worked with the new Christian community for some five years or
more (Acts <b>18</b>:11 + <b>19</b>:8-10 + <b>20</b>:3 + travel times). Philippi
was across the Aegean Sea from Troas, where Luke may have met Paul. Maybe he
omitted first person references in the other two sections to avoid making the
account seem too much about him. That is clearly the case in <b>20</b>:16-38,
which consists mainly of Paul’s discourse to the Ephesian elders: a brief time
elapsed, and there was no change of location. The third break between “we
segments”—from <b>21</b>:19 to <b>26</b>:32—involves a two-year span and a move
from Jerusalem to Caesarea, but it forms a unit. Perhaps Luke remained with the
apostle throughout that cluster of events and during that time did research for
the gospel (Luke <b>1</b>:1-4) and parts of Acts <b>1-12</b>. He could have
interviewed Mary in Jerusalem, Philip in Caesarea (Acts <b>21</b>:8; <b>8</b>:40),
and so on. It is odd that just as Paul is about to embark for Rome, Luke would
know to return to a locale so far from his home if he was back in Troas or perhaps
Philippi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span>Compare
Galatians <b>4</b>:12-20? Poor eyesight has been suggested on the basis of
Galatians <b>4</b>:15 (<i>“you would have plucked out your eyes and given them
to me”</i>) and <b>6</b>:11 (<i>“See with what large letters I have written to
you with my own hand”</i>). Others have suggested from Galatians<b> 4</b>:13
that Paul had relapses from malaria contracted earlier in the lower coastal
areas of Asia Minor during the first tour (<i>“because of an infirmity of the
flesh I preached the gospel to you the first time”</i>). Maybe he had recurring
difficulties like migraine headaches due to a concussion sustained in the
stoning at Lystra (Acts <b>14</b>:19-20). In 2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:1-6 Paul
juxtaposes being caught up to the third heaven (<b>12</b>:7-10) with the thorn
in the flesh (<b>12</b>:7-10). The <i>“out of the body”/“near-death experience”</i>
(?) may have occurred in connection with that stoning, which could account also
for his saying rather early in ministry that he bore in his body the marks of
the Lord Jesus (Galatians <b>6</b>:17). (The stoning, however, may have
happened too late in the Galatian mission to explain his remarks in Galatians <b>4</b>:13.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Luke’s serving with Paul as his personal
physician can be somewhat qualified by periods of time when he may not have
been with Paul, notably that possible five-year stretch in Acts <b>18</b>:11 + <b>19</b>:8-10
+ <b>20</b>:3 + travel times. On the other hand, the absence of “we” may not
indicate absence from the apostle. </span></p>
