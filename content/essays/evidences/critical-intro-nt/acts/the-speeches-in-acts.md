Observations on this data include the following. (1) Most, if not all, the sermons are surely condensations. The sermon on Pentecost, for example, lasts only about two and a half minutes. The two letters preserved in The Acts could be complete since their length is appropriate to their purposes. Since the presentations by Paul and Tertullus in Caesarea occurred in official courtroom settings, Luke may have had access to stenographic records of what transpired. Nevertheless, they, too, are not apt to provide full accounts of accusation and defense.

(2) The several presentations of the gospel to first-time hearers maintain good variety. There is little repetition of Old Testament background, testimony from personal experience, or the form of polemic. Even the three accounts of Paul’s conversion vary significantly despite being condensations.

(3) Besides being informative, these discourse sections serve a rhetorical purpose: they heighten interest by creating variety, realism, and focus. They are to the narrative in The Acts what the logia (“sayings”) are to Luke’s gospel.

(4) Each speech fits its audience. The earlier sermons in Palestine are natural for Jewish hearers. Paul’s presentation to pagan philosophers in Athens follows a pattern they could appreciate. Similarly, his urgent words to the heathen worshipers in Lystra offer an interpretation of nature and experience rather than presuppose a knowledge of Old Testament revelation. There is respect in the way both Tertullus and Paul present themselves before Felix. The same demeanor is evident in Paul’s defense before Agrippa. Tertullus, an orator, has an especially flowery statement of accusation against Paul. Paul’s characteristic boldness shines through in his appeal to Agrippa right during the court proceedings (<strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:27).
