<strong>FACTORS IN INTERPRETATION</strong>




1.	The nature of the New Testament: body of law or book of wisdom (See essays on “Imperatival Intent” and “Law and Wisdom.”)?


2.	The nature of the pastoral epistles: contain mandates on morality all the way through exhortations and cultural sensitivities down to bylaw material


3.  	The nature of 2 Timothy materials: directed to a local situation (Ephesus) or applicable to all the churches of the Gentile territories (note <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:7)?


4.  	The lack of homogeneity in lists: lifting up holy hands and dress code items need not be of the same sort as female subjection manifested in not teaching or exercising authority over men


5.	“Quietness” (ἡσυχία, <em>hēsychia</em>, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11, 12) as a manifestation of the female deference principle (distinction between the principle itself and the cultural manner of manifesting it):  note the cognate term ἡσύχάζω (<em>hēsychazō</em>), meaning “to rest”; in Luke <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:56b, where it is used of “resting” on the Sabbath day.


6.  	The meaning of “teach” (διδάσκω, <em>didaskō</em>): impart information or teach normatively?


7.  	<em>“I do not allow”</em> (<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:12): descriptive or policy or timeless prescription (cp. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:8; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:14; also Philippians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:12; Titus<strong> 3</strong>:8)?


8. 	<em>“I do not allow”</em> (οὐκ ἐπιτρέπω, <em>ouk</em> <em>epitrepō</em>): address standard situation, make a generality statement, or word a uniformity?


9.  	γυνή/ἀνήρ (<em>gynē/anēr</em>; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:12): gender roles or spouse relationship (<em>“man/woman”</em> <em>vs</em>.

<em>“husband/ wife”</em>?


10.	“Teach” and “exercise authority” (<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:12) as two verbal ideas or one composite idea (teach authoritatively; hendiadys)?


11.	The reason for not teaching: because women were not well educated in the ancient world, because it implied status over, because Paul means “teach authoritatively” (see above) similar to the meaning of “teach” in <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:7; cp. also <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:3; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:11, 13; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:17; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:2, 3; note             2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:2, 24; Titus <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:4?


12.  	The meaning of αὐθεντέω (<em>authenteō</em>;<strong> 2</strong>:12): exercise authority, domineer, usurp?


13. 	<em>“Ruling”</em> within an implied limitation (<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:12): in any circumstance or within the eldership role, that is, within the ultimate responsibility position in the church (cp. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:2+5; note also <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:17)?


14.  	The sense in which the historical reasons are, in fact, reasons (<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:12-13): relative gifting rather than to historical occurrence <em>per se</em>, as reasons for wisdom rather than reasons for law (= as reasons for a personal policy), as reasons for a generality or uniformity?


15.  	The meaning of <em>“formed”</em> (ἐπλάσθη, <em>eplasthē</em>, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:13): “formed” or “informed”


16. 	Basis for the idea that Adam was not deceived (<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:14): inference from the Old Testament text or a notion from tradition?


17.	<em>“Saved through childbearing”</em> (διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας, <em>dia tēs teknogonias</em>, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:15): “childrearing” rather than <em>“childbearing”</em>?
