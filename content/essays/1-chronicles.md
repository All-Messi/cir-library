18The descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe were 44,760—brave men who carried shield and sword, shot bow and arrow, were capable in battle. 19They fought the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. 20God helped them and delivered the Hagrites and everybody that was with them, because they cried out to God in the battle. He granted their petition because they trusted in him. 21They took their livestock: 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys, and 100,000 men. 22Many fell slain because the war came from God. They settled in their place. 23The descendants of the Manasseh half-tribe lived in the land. They were numerous from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon. 24The heads of their clans were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, trained soldiers, famous men. 25But they sinned against their ancestors’ God and committed prostitution with the gods of the people in the land God had destroyed. 26The God of Israel stirred up Pul, king of Assyria—also known as Tilgath-pilneser/Tiglathpileser—and he took Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe into exile, to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan River ever since. 	1 Ch 5:11-26

15Machir took a wife for Huppim and for Shuppim. His sister was Maacah. The name of

the second was Zelophehad, who had daughters. 16Maacah wife of Machir had a son

she named Peresh. His brother was Sheresh Avi-Ulam and Rakem.

The descendants of Joseph lived in those towns.  			1 Ch 7:20-29

30The sons of ASHER: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, as well as their sister Serah

31The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel Avi-Birzaith.

8:1BENJAMIN was father of Bela his firstborn, Ashbel second, Aharah third, 2Nohah fourth, and Rapha fifth.

3Bela was father of Addar, Gera, Abihud, 4Abishua, Naaman, Ahoah, 5Gera, Shephuphan, and Huram.

6These are the sons of Ehud, heads of families among the people in Geba. They were exiled to Manahath: 7Naaman, Ahijah, and Gera Avi-Uzza and Ahihud.

8Shaharaim was the father of children in Moab after he’d sent away his wives Hushim and Baara. 9By his wife Hodesh he became father of Jobab, Zibia, Mesha, Malcam, 10Jeuz, Sachia, Mirmah, sons and heads of families. 11By Hushim he’d become father of Abitub and Elpaal.

1 Ch 8:1-11

12The sons of Elpaal were Eber, Misham, Shemed—who built Ono and Lod with their villages—13Beriah and Shema (heads of families among the people in Aijalon, who routed the people in Gath); 14Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth.

15Zebadiah, Arad, Eder, 16Michael, Ishpah, and Joha were sons of Beriah.

Those were all descendants of Benjamin.			1 Ch 8:29-40

9:1So Israel was enrolled by genealogies. They’re recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel. Judah was exiled to Babylon because they were unfaithful.

2The first to live again in their towns were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Temple servants. 3Some descendants of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem:

4from the descendants of Perez Ben-Judah was Uthai Ben-Ammihud Ben-Omri Ben-Imri Ben-Bani;

5from the Shilonites were Asaiah the firstborn and his sons;

6from the sons of Zerah were Jeuel and their relatives: 690;

7from the descendants of Benjamin were Sallu Ben-Meshullam Ben-Hodaviah Ben-Hassenuah, 8and Ibneiah Ben-Jeroham, Elah Ben-Uzzi Ben-Michri, and Meshullam Ben-Shephatiah Ben-Reuel Ben-Ibnijah, 9and their relatives by generations: 956. Those were heads of families.										1 Ch 9:1-9

10From the priests were Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, 11Azariah Ben-Hilkiah Ben-Meshullam Ben-Zadok Ben-Meraioth Ben-Ahitub, the chief officer of God’s Temple; 12Adaiah Ben-Jeroham Ben-Pashhur Ben-Malchijah, Maasai Ben-Adiel Ben-Jahzerah Ben-Meshullam Ben-Meshillemith Ben-Immer, 13and their relatives, heads of their families: 1,760 capable men for the service of God’s Temple.

14From the Levites were Shemaiah Ben-Hasshub Ben-Azrikam Ben-Hashabiah from the sons of Merari; 15Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, Mattaniah Ben-Mica Ben-Zichri Ben-Asaph, 16Obadiah Ben-Shemaiah Ben-Galal Ben-Jeduthun, Berechiah Ben-Asa Ben-Elkanah that lived in the villages of the Netophathites.					1 Ch 9:10-16

17The gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their relatives, (Shallum the chief) 18stationed previously at the king’s gate to the east. 19Shallum Ben-Kore Ben-Ebiasaph Ben-Korah, and his relatives from his family—the Korahites—were over the work of the service, who kept the thresholds of the tent like their ancestors had done over the entrance to the camp of Yahveh. 20Phinehas Ben-Eleazar ruled over them previously; Yahveh was with him. 21Zechariah Ben-Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 22There were 212 chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds. They were enrolled by genealogy in their villages, men that David and Samuel the seer appointed in their office of trust. 23They and their descendants guarded the gates of Yahveh’s Temple—when it was a tabernacle—24on all four sides. 25Their relatives in their villages were to come in every seven days to be with them. 26The four chief gatekeepers (Levites) were in an office of trust over the rooms and treasuries in God’s Temple. 27They spent the night around God’s Temple, because they were responsible for guarding them. They were responsible for opening the Temple each morning.

28Some of them were responsible for the utensils for service. They counted them when they brought them in and took them out. 29Some were appointed to oversee the furniture and utensils for the sanctuary, the fine flour, the wine, oil, frankincense, and spices. 30Some descendants of the priests mixed the spices. 31Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for what was baked in pans. 32Some relatives of the Kohathites prepared the showbread every Sabbath. 	1 Ch 9:17-32

33These are the singers, heads of families among the Levites. They lived in rooms in the Temple because they were on duty day and night. 34They were heads of families among the Levites according to their generations, chief men living in Jerusalem.

35Jeiel Avi-Gibeon lived in Gibeon; his wife was Maacah. 36His firstborn was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 37Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.

38Mikloth was father of Shimeam/Shimeah. All these families lived near each other in Jerusalem. 	1 Ch 9:33-38

39Ner was father of Kish Avi-Saul Avi-Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

40Jonathan was father of Merib-baal Avi-Micah 41Avi-Pithon, Melech,

Tahrea, 42and Ahaz Avi-Jarah Avi-Alemeth, Azmaveth, and

Zimri Avi-Moza 43Avi-Binea, Rephaiah, Eleasah and Azel. 44Azel had six sons: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan.

1 Ch 9:39-44

The Death of Saul and His Sons

10:1The Philistines attacked Israel, and they fled and fell dead on Mount Gilboa. 2The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons and struck down his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua. 3The battle grew intense against Saul, and the archers wounded him. 4He told his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through so these uncircumcised Philistines don’t come and torture me.” But his armor bearer was too afraid to do it; so Saul took his sword and fell on it. 5When his armor bearer saw he was dead, he fell on his sword too. 6So Saul’s whole dynasty died together.

7When the Israelites in the valley saw they’d fled and Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled; the Philistines came and lived in them. 8The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons. 9They stripped him, took his head and armor, and sent messengers around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and the people. 10They put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 11When Jabesh-gilead heard what they’d done to Saul, 12brave men got up and took the bodies of Saul and his sons, buried their bones under the terebinth tree in Jabesh, and fasted for a week.

13So Saul died for his trespass against Yahveh 14and because he inquired from a medium instead of Yahveh. He killed him and turned the kingdom over to David.     	1 Ch 10:1-14

David Anointed King

11:1Then Israel gathered to David in Hebron,

“We’re your flesh and bone. 2When Saul was king, you led out and brought in Israel. Yahveh your God said you would shepherd his people and be their leader.”

3The elders in Israel came to him, and he made a treaty with them in Yahveh’s presence. They anointed him king according to Yahveh’s message through Samuel.

4Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (Jebus). The Jebusites, natives in the land, lived there. 5They told David, “You won’t get in here”; but he captured the fortress of Zion (The City of David). 6He had said, “Whoever strikes down the Jebusites first will be general of the army.” Joab Ben-Zeruiah went up first, so he became the general. 7David lived in the fortress; so they called it The City of David. 8He built the city all around from the Millo to the surrounding area, and Joab repaired the rest of Jerusalem. 9David became greater and greater because Yahveh was with him.	1 Ch 11:1-9

David’s Mighty Men

10These are David’s leading powerful warriors, who greatly supported him in his kingdom, along with all Israel, in making him king. 11They were Jashobeam son of a Hachmonite, chief of the 30. He killed 300 men with his spear at one time. 12After him was Eleazar Ben-Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three powerful men. 13He was with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines converged there for battle. There was a barley field, and the people were fleeing from the Philistines. 14They took their stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. Yahveh gave them a great victory.

15Three of the 30 chief men went down to the rock to David into the cave near Adullam while the Philistine army was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. 16Davd was in the stronghold while the Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem. 17David was thirsty and said, “Oh that somebody would give me a drink from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!” 18The three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at Bethlehem and took it to David. But he wouldn’t drink it; he poured it out to Yahveh. 19“In the presence of my God, I can’t do that. Should I, in effect, drink these men’s blood who risked their lives to bring it?” Those were exploits the three powerful men did.	1 Ch 11:10-19

20Abishai, Joab’s brother, was leader of the 30. He killed 300 with a spear; he had a reputation as well as the 30. 21Of the three in the second rank, he had the greatest honor and became their commander. But he didn’t measure up to the three.

22Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada, son of a fearless warrior from Kabzeel, powerful in deeds, struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day. 23He killed an Egyptian that was 7ft 6. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from him and killed him with it. 24-25Benaiah was renowned among the 30, but he didn’t measure up to the three. David appointed him over his guard.	1 Ch 11:20-25

26The elite soldiers in the armies were Asahel brother of Joab, Elhanan Ben-Dodo from Bethlehem, 27Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 28Ira Ben-Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 29Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 30Maharai the Netophathite, Heled Ben-Baanah the Netophathite, 31Ithai Ben-Ribai from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 32Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 33Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 34the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan Ben-Shagee the Hararite, 35Ahiam Ben-Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal Ben-Ur, 36Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 37Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai Ben-Ezbai, 38Joel brother of Nathan, Mibhar Ben-Hagri, 39Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer for Joab Ben-Zeruiah, 40Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 41Uriah the Hittite, Zabad Ben-Ahlai; 42Adina Ben-Shiza the Reubenite, a chief in Reuben and 30 with him; 43Hanan Ben-Maacah and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 44Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 45Jediael Ben-Shimri and Joha his brother, the Tizite; 46Eliel the Mahavite and Jeribai and Joshaviah sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite; 47Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.	 1 Ch 11:26-47

Warriors Join David

12:1These are men that came over to David at Ziklag, while he still couldn’t move around freely because of Saul. They were among the elite soldiers that helped him during war. 2They used bows. With either hand they could sling stones and shoot arrows. They were Saul’s relatives from Benjamin. 3The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah and Jehu the Anathothite; 4Ishmaiah the Gibeonite,

an elite soldier among the 30 and a leader over them. Then came Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite, 5Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite; 6Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the Korahites; 7Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jerobam of Gedor.

8From Gad, brave soldiers came over to David in the stronghold in the open country. They were men trained in war, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like lions’ faces. They were as fast as gazelles on the mountains. 9Numbered 1-11, they were Ezer, Obadiah, Eliab, 10Mishmannah, Jeremiah, 11Attai, Eliel, 12Johanan, Elzabad, 13Jeremiah, and Machbannai. 14They were commanders in the army. The least was worth 100; the best was worth 1,000. 15They crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was flooding and put to flight everybody in the valleys to the east and the west.	1 Ch 12:1-15

16Then some men from Benjamin and Judah came to David’s stronghold. 17He went out to meet them,

“If you come peacefully to help me, my heart will be with yours. But if you’ve come to betray me to my adversaries, since I haven’t done anything wrong, may the God of our ancestors look at it and decide.”

18The Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the 30,

“We’re yours, David;

we’re with you, Ben-Jesse!

Peace, peace to you,

and peace to the One that helps you.

Indeed, your God helps you!”

David accepted them and made them captains of the band.	1 Ch 12:16-18

19From Manasseh also some came over to David when he was going with the Philistines to fight Saul. (But he didn’t end up helping them, because the lords of the Philistines conferred and sent him away, “He might desert to his Saul and turn on us.”) 20As he was going to Ziklag, these came over to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, commanders of thousands in Manasseh. 21They helped him against the bands of raiders, because they were fearless soldiers and commanders in the army. 22Daily, men kept coming over to help David, till there was a large army like God’s army.

23These are the divisions of armed troops that came to David in Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him like Yahveh said:

24from Judah: 6,800 armed troops that carried shield and spear;

25from Simeon: 7,100 fearless soldiers;

26from Levi: 4,600;

27from Jehoiada, leader of Aaron’s house: 3,700;

28and Zadok, a fearless young soldier, of his family: 22 captains;

29from Benjamin: 3,000 of Saul’s relatives, the greater part previously allied with Saul’s house.

30from Ephraim: 20,800 fearless soldiers, famous in their families;

31from the Manasseh half-tribe: 18,000 men picked by name to make David king;

32from Issachar: 200 chiefs that understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do; with their relatives at their command;

33from Zebulun: 50,000 seasoned troops, ready for battle and equipped with all kinds of weapons; who helped David wholeheartedly.

34from Naphtali: 1,000 captains and 37,000 that carried shield and spear;

35from Dan: 28,600 equipped for battle;

36from Asher: 40,000 seasoned troops ready for battle;

37from beyond the Jordan—Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe:  120,000 armed with all kinds of weapons.	 1 Ch 12:19-37

38These battle-ready men came to Hebron fully intending to make David king over all Israel. The rest in Israel were also intent on making him king. 39They were there with him three days, eating and drinking, because their relatives had made preparations for them. 40People nearby and as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—great amounts of cakes, fig cakes and bunches of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep. There was happiness in Israel.	1 Ch 12:38-40

The Ark Brought from Kiriath-Jearim

13:1Then David consulted with every commander of thousands and hundreds, 2and told the whole assembly,

“If it seems good to you and if Yahveh our God wills, let’s send around to our relatives that are still in Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites that are with them in their towns and pastures, to have them meet with us. 3Let’s bring the Ark back. We neglected it in Saul’s time.”

4The assembly agreed because it seemed right to them. 5He brought Israel together from the Shihor in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring God’s Ark from Kiriath-jearim. 6He and all Israel went up to Baalah (Kiriath-jearim) on the edge of Judah to bring up God’s Ark, which wears the name Yahveh, who is enthroned between the cherubs. 7They hauled the Ark on a new cart from Abinadab’s house; Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 8David and all Israel were celebrating to God with all their energy—with songs and lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.

9When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon/Nachon, Uzza reached out to steady the Ark, because the oxen stumbled. 10Yahveh’s anger burned against him, so he struck him down, and he died there in front of God. 11David was mad because Yahveh “lashed out against Uzza,” and has called the place Perez-uzza ever since. 12David was afraid of God that day, “How can I bring the Ark home to me?” 13So he didn’t take it to The City of David but to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite nearby. 14It stayed with his family for three months, and Yahveh blessed them and everybody he had.     	1 Ch 13:1-14

David’s Wives and Children

14:1Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a palace. 2David saw that Yahveh had made him secure as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly regarded for Israel’s sake. 3He took more wives at Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters. 4His children born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 5Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 6Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 7Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 	1 Ch 14:1-7

Philistines Defeated

8When the Philistines heard they’d anointed David king over all Israel, they went up to look for him. He heard about it and went out against them. 9They’d made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 10David asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them to me?” Yahveh said, “Yes, go on up.” 11They went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them. He said, “God has used me to ‘break through’ my enemies like a flash flood”; so they named the place Baal-perazim. 12The Philistines abandoned their gods there; David had them burned.

13The Philistines made another raid in the valley. 14David asked God again, and he said,

“Don’t attack them head on. Circle around behind them and come at them across from the balsam trees. 15When you hear marching in the tops of the balsam trees, attack. God will have gone out ahead of you to strike their army.”

16David did that, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 17His fame went out to all the countries, and Yahveh made them afraid of him. 	1 Ch 14:8-17

The Ark Brought to Jerusalem

15:1David built houses for himself in The City of David and prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 2He said, “Don’t anybody carry the Ark but Levites. Yahveh chose them to carry it and serve him permanently.” 3He gathered Israel to Jerusalem to bring the Ark up to the place he’d prepared. 4He gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites:

5from the descendants of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and 120 of his relatives;

6from the descendants of Merari, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives;

7from the descendants of Gershom, Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives;

8from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives;

9from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives;

10from the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives.

11David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests and for the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,

12“You’re heads of families among the Levites. Consecrate yourselves and your relatives so you can bring the Ark up to the place I’ve prepared. 13You didn’t carry it the first time, so Yahveh lashed out on us; we didn’t look to him according to the ordinance.”

14The priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the Ark. 15The Levites carried it on their shoulders, with the poles on it like Moses had commanded by Yahveh’s message.

1 Ch 15:1-15

16David told the chiefs among the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers and the ones with musical instruments—harps, lyres, loud cymbals—to make joyful music. 17The Levites appointed Heman Ben-Joel and his relatives, Asaph Ben-Berechiah, and Ethan Ben-Kushaiah from the descendants of Merari their relatives. 18The Levites appointed with them their relatives of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. 19The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to sound loud bronze cymbals. 20Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth. 21Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres pitched to The Sheminith. 22Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing. He taught singing because he was good at it. 23Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the Ark. 24Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests blew bugles ahead of the Ark. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also gatekeepers for the Ark.   1 Ch 15:16-24

25David, with the elders in Israel and the commanders of thousands, went to bring up the Ark from Obed-edom’s house with joy. 26Because God was helping the Levites that were carrying the Ark, they sacrificed 7 bulls and 7 rams. 27David dressed in a fine linen robe with the Levites that were carrying the Ark, the singers, and Chenaniah, who led the singing. David also wore a linen ephod. 28Israel brought up the Ark with shouting, blowing rams’ horns and trumpets, crashing cymbals, and playing harps and lyres. 29When the Ark came to The City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked out the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating; and she despised him. 	1 Ch 15:25-29

16:1They put the Ark in the tent David had pitched for it and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to God. 2When David had finished offering them, he blessed the people in Yahveh’s name. 3To every man and woman in Israel, he passed out a loaf of bread, a helping of meat, and a raisin cake.

4He appointed some Levites to serve at the Ark—to celebrate, thank, and praise Yahveh God of Israel: 5Asaph the chief, second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel with musical instruments—harps and lyres. Asaph played the loud cymbals; 6Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew bugles constantly in front of the Ark.

7That day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to Yahveh.

1 Ch 16:1-7

David’s Song of Thanks

8Thank Yahveh; call on him;

tell the nations what he’s done.

9Sing to him, sing praises to him;

talk about his wonderful works.

10Take pride in his holy name;

let the people that look to him be happy.

11Look to Yahveh and his strength;

look to him continually.

12Remember the wonderful things he’s done,

his miracles and the judgments he’s spoken,

13descendants of Israel his servant,

sons of Jacob his chosen ones. 				1 Ch 16:8-13

14He’s Yahveh our God;

his judgments are all over the world.

15Remember his covenant forever,

the message he commanded to a thousand generations,

16his covenant with Abraham,

his oath to Isaac.

17He confirmed it to Jacob as a statute,

to Israel as an everlasting covenant,

18“I’ll give you Canaan for an inheritance.”

19When they were just a few

with temporary residents included,

20they wandered about from nation to nation,

from one kingdom to another.				1 Ch 16:14-20

21He didn’t let anybody oppress them;

he reproved kings for their sakes:

22“Don’t touch my anointed ones;

don’t harm my prophets.”

23Sing to Yahveh, all the earth;

tell the good news about his salvation every day.

24Tell about his glory the world over,

his wonderful deeds among the nations.

25Yahveh is great, and deserves great praise;

he’s to be feared more than all other gods.

26The people’s gods are idols,

but Yahveh made the sky.

27Honor and majesty are with him;

strength and joy belong to him.				1 Ch 16:21-27

28Attribute to Yahveh, families of the nations,

attribute to him glory and strength.

29Atribute to Yahveh the glory that’s due him;

bring him an offering;

worship him in holy array.

30Tremble in his presence, all the earth;

yes, the world stands firm; it won’t be moved.

31Let the sky be happy and the earth celebrate;

let them say among the nations, “Yahveh reigns!”

32Let the sea roar and everything that fills it;

let the field celebrate and everything in it.		1 Ch 16:28-32

33Then the trees in the forest will sing for joy,

because Yahveh’s coming to judge the world.

34Give thanks to Yahveh because he’s good;

his love endures forever.

35Then say, “Save us, our saving God;

gather us and deliver us from the nations

to give thanks to your holy name

and take pride in praising you.”

36Bless Yahveh God of Israel,

from everlasting to everlasting.

Then the people said “Amen” and praised Yahveh.	1 Ch 16:33-36

37He left Asaph and his relatives at the Ark to serve continually as each day’s work required. 38He left Obed-edom with his 68 relatives and Hosah with the son of Jeduthun as gatekeepers. 39He left Zadok the priest and his relatives at the Tabernacle in the high place at Gibeon 40to offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, according to the law Yahveh commanded Israel. 41With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest that were designated by name to give thanks to Yahveh because his love endures forever. 42With them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for the ones that sounded out loud with instruments for the songs of God and the sons of Jeduthun for the gate. 43Then the people left for home, and David went back to bless his household.	 1 Ch 16:37-43

The LORD’s Covenant with David

17:1While David was living in his palace, he told Nathan the prophet, “I’m living in a cedar palace, but Yahveh’s Ark is under curtains.”

2Nathan said, “Do what’s in your mind. God is with you.”

3That same night, the message from God came to him,

4“Go tell my servant David, ‘Yahveh says, “You’re not to build me a temple. 5I haven’t lived in a temple since I brought Israel up. I’ve gone from tent to tent and place to place. 6In all the places where I’ve lived with Israel, have I asked any judge that I’ve commanded to shepherd my people why he hasn’t built me a cedar temple?”’ 7Tell David, ‘Yahveh of hosts says, “I took you out of the pasture from behind sheep and made you a leader over Israel. 8I’ve been with you wherever you’ve gone and removed your enemies from you. I’ll make you as famous as anyone that’s ever lived in the world. 9I’ll appoint you a place for my people, and plant them so they won’t have to move anymore. Sinful people won’t lay waste to them like they did before, 10including the time I put judges over them. I’ll subdue your enemies and build you a dynasty. 11When your life’s over and you’ve gone to your ancestors, I’ll set up one of your sons and secure his throne permanently. 12He’ll build me a temple. 13I’ll be his father, and he’ll be my son. I won’t take my enduring love away from him like I did with your predecessor. 14I’ll settle him in my house and kingdom permanently.”’”	1 Ch 17:1-14

15Nathan told David everything in his vision.

David’s Prayer

16Then David went in and sat in Yahveh’s presence,

“Who am I, Yahveh God, and what’s my family that you’ve brought me this far? 17It’s a small thing for you, but you’ve talked about my dynasty for a long time to come and regarded me by the standard for men of high degree. 18What more can I say about the honor you’ve put on me? You know me. 19For my sake and from your own heart, you’ve done these great things and made them known. 20Nobody’s like you; there’s no God besides you. From everything we’ve heard, 21what nation is like Israel? You went to redeem them out of Egypt to make a name for yourself with great and terrifying acts, in driving out nations ahead of your people. 22You made Israel your people permanently and became their God. 23Now make permanent your promise about me and my dynasty. 24Establish your name and make it great forever. 25-26It’s a good thing that you’ve revealed to me that you’ll build a dynasty for me. That’s encouraged me to pray to you. 27It has pleased you to bless my family so it will continue permanently. You’ve blessed it forever.” 	1 Ch 17:15-27

David’s Military Victories

18:1After that, David defeated the Philistines and took Gath and its surrounding towns. 2He defeated Moab and they brought tribute. 3He defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah, as far as Hamath and secured his rule all the way to the Euphrates River. 4He took 1,000 chariots, 7,000 cavalry, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He hamstrung the chariot horses but reserved enough for 100 chariots.

5When the Arameans from Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them. 6He put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans brought tribute. 7He took the gold shields that Hadadezer’s officers carried and brought them to Jerusalem. 8From Tibhath and Cun, towns of Hadadezer, he took a large amount of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze sea, pillars, and bronze utensils.	 1 Ch 18:1-8

9Tou/Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated Hadadezer’s whole army. 10He sent his son Hadoram to greet him and bless him for it. Hadoram brought all kinds of gold, silver, and bronze articles. 11David dedicated them to Yahveh with the silver and gold he’d carried off from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalek.

12In addition, Abishai Ben-Zeruiah defeated 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 13He put garrisons in Edom, and the Edomites served him. Yahveh helped him wherever he went.

14David ruled Israel and administered justice and goodness for his people.

15Joab Ben-Zeruiah was over the army;

Jehoshaphat Ben-Ahilud was recorder;

16Zadok Ben-Ahitub and Abimelech Ben-Abiathar were priests;

Shavsha was secretary;

17Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada was captain of David’s bodyguard;

David’s sons were chiefs at his side.	1 Ch 18:9-17

David Defeats the Ammonites and Syrians

19:1After this, Nahash, king of the Ammonites, died and his son became king. 2David said, “I’ll be kind to Hanun because his father was kind to me.” He sent ambassadors to console him about his father. 3But the officials in Ammon told Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending ambassadors to comfort you? Haven’t they come to spy out the land to overthrow it?” Hanun took David’s ambassadors and shaved them, cut off their clothes in the middle as high as their hips, and sent them away. 5Some people came and told David about the men. He sent to meet them because they were greatly humiliated. He told them to stay in Jericho till their beards grew back; then come home.

6When the Ammonites saw they’d been offensive to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 37¾ tons 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and cavalry from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and Zobah. 7They hired 32,000 chariots, the king of Maacah, and his soldiers. They camped by Medeba. The Ammonites gathered from their towns and came to battle. 8When David heard it, he sent Joab and the whole army, the strongest soldiers. 9The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to the city. The kings that had come were by themselves in the field.    	1 Ch 19:1-9

10When Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he selected elite soldiers and arrayed them against the Arameans. 11The rest he placed under his brother Abishai, and they arrayed themselves against the Ammonites. 12He said,

“If the Arameans are too strong for me, you help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll help you. 13Be strong; let’s show ourselves courageous for our people and the towns of our God. May Yahveh do what seems good to him.”

14Joab and his troops engaged the Arameans, and they fled. 15When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they retreated from Abishai into the city. Then Joab made a trip to Jerusalem.

16When the Arameans saw Israel had defeated them, they sent ambassadors to bring out the Arameans from the other side of the River with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. 17When David heard it, he mustered Israel, crossed the Jordan, and came on them. He drew up in formation against them, and they fought him. 18They fled, and he killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put Shophach to death. 19When Hadadezer’s vassals saw Israel had defeated them, they surrendered and served David. The Arameans weren’t willing to help the Ammonites anymore.	 1 Ch 19:10-19

The Capture of Rabbah

20:1In the spring, when kings go to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the country of the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and overthrew it. 2Then David went to Rabbah and took the crown off their king’s head, and found that it weighed 75½ lbs a talent of gold, and was set with precious stones. They placed it on David’s head, and he brought out a really large amount of spoil from the city. 3He brought the people out, and cut them with saws, sharp instruments, and axes. He did that to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the people came back to Jerusalem.

4About this time, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, and they were subdued. 5There was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan Ben-Jair killed Lahmi brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 6Another time there was war at Gath, where there was a huge man with six digits on each hand and foot. He had descended from the giants too. 7When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimea, killed him. 8Those three descended from the giants in Gath that David and his warriors killed. 	1 Ch 20:1-8

David’s Ill-Advised Census

21:1Satan stood up against Israel and tempted David to take a census. 2David told Joab and the commanders of the troops,

“Go count Israel from Dan to Beersheba and bring me the results so I can know how many there are.”

3Joab said, “May Yahveh add to his people 100 times as many as they are! But my lord the king, aren’t they all serving you? Why do you want to know this? Why bring guilt on Israel?”

4But the king’s word prevailed. So Joab went all over Israel and came back to Jerusalem. 5He gave David the census number: 1,100,000 swordsmen in Israel and 470,000 in Judah. 6He didn’t count Levi and Benjamin because he abhorred the king’s command. 7God was displeased with this thing, so he struck Israel. 	1 Ch 21:1-7

8David said to God, “I’ve committed an awful sin. Please take it away. I’ve done something really foolish.”

9Yahveh told Gad, David’s seer, 10“Tell David,

‘Yahveh says 11to take 12either three years of famine, three months of being swept away by your enemies’ sword, or three days of the sword of Yahveh when his angel destroys throughout Israel.’ What should I report to the One that sent me?”     	1 Ch 21:8-12

13David told Gad, “I’m in great distress. I’ll cast myself on Yahveh’s mercy because it’s so great. Don’t let me fall into human hands.” 14Yahveh sent a plague on Israel; 70,000 people died. 15He sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem; but as he was about to do it, he looked and was sad over the catastrophe. He told the destroying angel, “That’s enough; relax your hand.” The angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan/Araunah the Jebusite. 16David looked up and saw him standing between earth and sky with his sword held out over Jerusalem. David and the elders, covered with burlap, fell on their faces. 17He told God, “I’m the one that sinned. What have these sheep done? Yahveh my God, please plague me and my father’s house, not your people.” 	1 Ch 21:13-17

David Builds an Altar

18Then the angel of Yahveh had Gad tell David to build an altar on Ornan’s/Araunah’s threshing floor. 19David went up. 20Ornan/Araunah turned and saw the angel, and his four sons hid. He was threshing wheat. 21As David came to him, he left the threshing floor and prostrated himself. 22David told him, “Sell me this threshing floor so I can build an altar on it. Give it to me at full price so God will restrain the plague.”

23Ornan/Araunah said,

“Take it and do what seems good. I’ll give the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, the wheat for the grain offering—all of it.”

24But King David said, “I won’t take what’s yours for Yahveh or offer a burnt offering that doesn’t cost me anything.” 25He paid him 15 lbs 600 shekels of gold for the site. 26He built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called to Yahveh, and he answered him with fire from the sky on the altar. 27Yahveh told the angel to sheath his sword.

28When David saw that Yahveh had answered him, he offered sacrifice there, 29because the Tabernacle and altar that Moses made were in the countryside at Gibeon. 30But David couldn’t go to it to ask God because the angel’s sword terrified him. 22:1David said, “This is the house of Yahveh God and the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” 	1 Ch 21:18-22:1

David’s Preparations for the Temple

2David issued an order to gather the foreigners in Israel and set stonecutters to dress stones for God’s Temple. 3He provided large stores of iron for making nails for the doors in the gates and for clamps, more bronze than could be weighed, 4and cedar logs without number. The Sidonians and Tyrians brought him large supplies of cedar timber. 5He said,

“My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and Yahveh’s Temple will be magnificent, famous, and glorious all over the world. I’ll stockpile materials for it.”

David gathered lots of material for it before he died.	1 Ch 22:2-5

6Then he called Solomon and charged him to build a temple for Yahveh God of Israel,

7“Son, I intended to build a temple for Yahveh, 8but his message came to me, ‘You won’t build me a temple; you’ve shed so much blood and fought great wars. 9You’ll have a son that’s not a military figure. I’ll give him rest from his enemies everywhere. His name will be Solomon because I’ll give Israel ‘peace’ and quiet during his life. 10He’ll build a temple for me. He’ll be my son, and I’ll be his father. I’ll make his kingdom permanently secure.’ 11Yahveh be with you so you can succeed at building it. 12May he give you with discretion and intelligence, and give you charge over Israel so you can keep his Law. 13You’ll prosper if you observe carefully the statutes and ordinances he commanded Moses. Be strong and courageous; don’t be afraid or intimidated. 14I’ve taken great pains to stockpile materials: 3775 tons 100,000 talents of gold, 37,750 tons 1,000,000 talents of silver, bronze and iron past weighing, timber, and stone. You can add to that. 15You have lots of stonecutters, stone masons, and carpenters skilled in all kinds of work. 16There’s no limit to the gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Get started. Yahveh be with you.”    	1 Ch 22:6-16

17He directed Israel’s leaders to help Solomon,

18“Isn’t Yahveh with you? Hasn’t he given you rest in every direction? He’s delivered to you the nations in the land, and it’s under control. 19Set your heart and soul to look to him. Build his sanctuary so you can bring the Ark and God’s holy articles into it.”	1 Ch 22:17-19

Duties of Levites

23:1When David got old, he appointed Solomon king over Israel. 2He gathered the leaders with the priests and Levites. 3The Levites 30 years old and up numbered 38,000. 4Of these, 24,000 oversaw the work, 6,000 were officers and judges, 54,000 were gatekeepers, and 4,000 praised Yahveh with instruments David made for that purpose. 6He divided them according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 	1 Ch 23:1-6

7The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.

8Three sons of Ladan were Jehiel the oldest, Jetham, and Joel.

9Three sons of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.

These were the heads of families in Ladan/Libni.

10-11The sons of Shimei were Jahath, first; Zina/Zizah, second. Jeush and Beriah didn’t have very many sons, so they were all counted as one family. 	1 Ch 23:7-11

12The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

13The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses.

Aaron and his sons were set apart permanently to sanctify Yahveh as most

holy, to burn incense to him, to perform service to him, and to bless in his

name.

14The sons of Moses, the man of God, were included in the tribe of Levi.

15The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.

16The son of Gershom was Shebuel the chief.

17The only son of Eliezer was Rehabiah.

Rehabiah had lots of sons.

18The son of Izhar was Shelomith the chief.

19The sons of Hebron were Jeriah, first; then Amariah, then Jahaziel, then Jekameam.

20The sons of Uzziel were Micah, first, then Isshiah.

21The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.

The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.

22Eleazar died and had only daughters, so their cousins, Kish’s sons, married them.

23The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.	1 Ch 23:12-23

24Those were Levi’s descendants by heads of families as counted in their census. They served in Yahveh’s Temple from 20 years old and up. 25David said, “Yahveh God of Israel has given his people rest, and he lives in Jerusalem permanently. 26The Levites won’t need to carry the Tabernacle and the utensils for its service.” 27By David’s last words, Levi’s descendants were counted from 20 years old and up. 28They were to assist Aaron’s descendants with the service in the courts and rooms in Yahveh’s Temple. They were to purify the holy things 29and help with the showbread, the fine flour for grain offerings, wafers without yeast, what’s baked in the pan, or what’s well-mixed, and all measures of volume and size. 30They were to stand each morning and evening to thank and praise Yahveh. 31They offered burnt offerings on Sabbaths, new moons, and scheduled festivals in the number set by the Law. 32They maintained the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place and helped Aaron’s descendants with the service in Yahveh’s house. 			1 Ch 23:24-32

Duties of Priests

24:1These were the divisions of Aaron’s descendants. His sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they didn’t have any sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 3David—with Zadok from Eleazar’s descendants and Ahimelech from Ithamar’s descendants—divided them by their offices for their service. 4Since there were more chief men descended from Eleazar than from Ithamar, they divided them into 16 heads descended from Eleazar and 8 from Ithamar. 5They divided them alike by lot because they were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God. 6Shemaiah Ben-Nethanel the secretary from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech Ben-Abiathar, and the heads of the families among the priests and Levites—one family taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar. 	1 Ch 24:1-6

7The first lot came out for Jehoiarib,	the second for Jedaiah,

8the third for Harim, 				the fourth for Seorim,

9the fifth for Malchijah, 			the sixth for Mijamin,

10the seventh for Hakkoz, 			the eighth for Abijah,

11the ninth for Jeshua, 			the tenth for Shecaniah,

12the eleventh for Eliashib, 			twelfth for Jakim,

13the thirteenth for Huppah, 			the fourteenth for Jeshebeab,

14the fifteenth for Bilgah, 			the sixteenth for Immer,

15the seventeenth for Hezir, 			the eighteenth for Happizzez,

16the nineteenth for Pethahiah, 	the twentieth for Jehezkel,

17the twenty-first for Jachin, 	the twenty-second for Gamul,

18the twenty-third for Delaiah, 	the twenty-fourth for Maaziah.

19Those were their officers for ministry when they came to Yahveh’s Temple according to the ordinance Aaron their ancestor gave them by Yahveh God’s command. 	1 Ch 24:7-19

20Now about the rest of the descendants of Levi:

from the descendants of Amram, Shubael;

from the descendants of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

21from Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.

22from the Izharites, Shelomoth;

from the descendants of Shelomoth, Jahath.

23the descendants of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, Jekameam fourth.  	1 Ch 24:20-23

24the descendants of Uzziel, Micah;

from the descendants of Micah, Shamir.

25the brother of Micah, Isshiah;

from the descendants of Isshiah, Zechariah.

26the descendants of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.

the descendants of Jaaziah: Beno.

27the descendants of Merari: by Jaaziah were Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.

28by Mahli: Eleazar, who didn’t have any sons.

29by Kish, the descendants of Kish: Jerahmeel.

30the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.

Those were the Levites by families. 31They also cast lots—the head of each family and his younger brother alike—like their relatives the descendants of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families among the priests and Levites.	1 Ch 24:24-31

Duties of Musicians

25:1David and the commanders of the army set apart some sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals. Those who performed their service were as follows:

2from the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king;

3from the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah—6 were under the direction of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied by giving thanks and praising Yahveh;

4from the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.

5Those were sons of Heman the king’s seer to honor him according to God’s message, because God gave Heman 14 sons and 3 daughters.

6Those were under their father’s direction to sing in Yahveh’s Temple, with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman served under the king’s direction. 7There were 288 trained in singing to Yahveh with their relatives, talented men. 8They cast lots for their duties, least and greatest, teacher and pupil.	1 Ch 25:1-8

9The first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph—he and his relatives made 12;

the second for Gedaliah—he and his relatives made 12;

10the third came out for Zaccur—he, his relatives, and sons made 12;

11the fourth came out for Izri, who with sons and relatives made 12;

12the fifth came out for Nethaniah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

13the sixth came out for Bukkiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

21for the fourteenth came out for Mattithiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

22the fifteenth came out for Jeremoth, who with sons and relatives made 12;

23the sixteenth came out for Hananiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

24the seventeenth came out for Joshbekashah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

27the twentieth came out for Eliathah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

28the twenty-first came out for Hothir, who with sons and relatives made 12;

29the twenty-second came out for Giddalti, who with sons and relatives made 12;

30the twenty-third came out for Mahazioth, who with sons and relatives made 12;

31the twenty-fourth came out for Romamti-ezer, who with sons and relatives made 12.

1 Ch 25:20-31

Duties of Gatekeepers

26:1For the divisions of the gatekeepers, from the Korahites there was Meshelemiah Ben-Kore from the sons of Asaph. 2Meshelemiah/Shelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael second, Zebadiah third, Jathniel fourth, 3Elam fifth, Johanan sixth, Eliehoenai seventh.

4Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad second, Joah third, Sacar fourth, Nethanel fifth, 5Ammiel sixth, Issachar seventh, and Peullethai eighth. God had blessed him. 6Shemaiah had sons who governed their family because they were brave soldiers. 7Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers Elihu and Semachiah were brave men. 8Obed-edom’s sons, their sons and relatives were capable and strong for the service—62.

9Meshelemiah had sons and relatives—18 brave men.

10Hosah Ben-Merari had sons: Shimri the first (though not born first; his father made him first), 11Hilkiah second, Tebaliah third, and Zechariah fourth. Hosah had 13 sons and relatives.

1 Ch 26:1-11

12To these divisions of the gatekeepers, the chief men were given duties like their relatives to serve in Yahveh’s Temple. 13According to their families, they cast lots, without regard for age, for each gate. 14The lot for the east gate fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his son Zechariah, an advisor with insight; his lot came out for the north gate. 15Obed-edom’s lot fell for the south; the storehouse went to his sons. 16For Shuppim and Hosah the lot fell for the west gate, by Shallecheth’s gate on the ascending highway. Guard corresponded to guard. 17There were six Levites on the east, four on the north and south each day, and at the storehouse two and two. 18At the Parbar on the west there were four at the highway and two at the Parbar. 19Those are the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of Korah and Merari. 	 1 Ch 26:12-19

Duties of Gatekeepers

20The Levites were responsible for the treasures in God’s Temple and the dedicated gifts. 21The sons of Ladan, descendants of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, that is, the Jehielites, were the heads of families. 22The sons of Jehieli—Zetham and Joel—were responsible for God’s Temple. 23As to the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites, 24Shebuel Ben-Gershom Ben-Moses was officer over the treasures. 25His relatives by Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 26That Shelomoth and his relatives were responsible for the treasures from the dedicated gifts that King David, the heads of families, commanders of thousands and hundreds, and commanders of the army had donated. 27They dedicated part of the spoils of war to repair Yahveh’s Temple. 28Shelomoth and his relatives were responsible for everything Samuel the seer, Saul Ben-Kish, Abner Ben- Ner, Joab Ben-Zeruiah, and everybody had donated. 29The Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons, were assigned to duties away from the LORD’s house as officers and judges. 30The Hebronites, Hashabiah and his relatives—1,700 capable men, oversaw Israel west of the Jordan, for the work of Yahveh and the service of the king. 31-32The Hebronites, Jerijah the chief and his relatives, capable men, were 2,700, heads of families. King David had them oversee Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe for the affairs of God and the king. (These Hebronites were investigated according to their genealogies and families in the fortieth year of David’s reign. Men with outstanding capability were found among them at Jazer in Gilead.)	1 Ch 26:20-32

Military Divisions

27:1These were heads of families, commanders of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in regard to the divisions that came in and went out month by month all year. Each division numbered 24,000.

2Jashobeam Ben-Zabdiel was responsible for the first division for the first month. 3He descended from Perez and was chief of the commanders of the army for the first month.

4Dodai the Ahohite and his division were responsible for the second month with Mikloth as chief officer.

5The third commander of the army for the third month was Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada the priest, as chief. 6This Benaiah was the most elite soldier of the 30 and responsible for 30. His son Ammizabad was responsible for his division. 	1 Ch 27:1-6

7The fourth for the fourth month was Joab’s brother Asahel and his son Zebadiah.

22for Dan, Azarel Ben-Jeroham.

Those were the officers of the tribes of Israel.	 1 Ch 27:16-22

23But David didn’t count the ones under 20 because Yahveh had said he would multiply Israel like the stars in the sky. 24Joab Ben-Zeruiah had started to count them but didn’t finish. Wrath came on Israel because of it, and the number wasn’t included in The Chronicles of King David.

25Azmaveth Ben-Adiel oversaw the king’s storehouses.

Jonathan Ben-Uzziah oversaw the storehouses in the country, towns, villages, and

towers.

26Ezri Ben-Chelub oversaw the farmers that plowed the ground.

Shaphat Ben-Adlai oversaw the cattle in the valleys.

30Obil the Ishmaelite oversaw the camels.

Jehiel Ben-Hachmoni tutored David’s sons.

33Ahithophel was advisor to the king.

Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.

34Jehoiada Ben-Benaiah and Abiathar succeededpl Ahithophel.

Joab commanded the king’s army.	    1 Ch 27:32-34

David’s Charge to Israel

28:1David gathered to Jerusalem the officials in Israel, the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, the overseers of the property and livestock that belong to the king and his sons, the officials and elite soldiers, all the brave warriors. 2He stood up and said,

“My relatives, my people. I intended to build a permanent temple for the Ark of the Covenant and for a footstool of our God; so I made preparations. 3But he told me, ‘You won’t build me a temple; you’re a soldier that’s shed blood.’ 4But Yahveh chose me from my father’s family to rule Israel permanently. He chose Judah to lead, chose my father’s family in Judah, and delighted in me among my brothers. 5From my sons he’s chosen Solomon to sit on the throne. (Yahveh has given me many sons.) 6He told me, ‘Solomon will build my temple and courts. I’ve chosen him to be my son, and I’ll be his father. 7I’ll make his kingdom permanently secure if he’s resolute in keeping my commandments and ordinances, like he is today.’ 8In front of Israel, in the assembly of Yahveh, and in the hearing of our God, endeavor to follow all his commandments so you can keep the good land and leave it for your descendants.

David’s Charge to Solomon

9“Solomon, son, know your father’s God. Serve him with all your heart and a willing mind, because Yahveh examines every heart and understands every intent. 10Be diligent about that because he has chosen you to build a temple for the sanctuary. Have the courage to do it.” 	1 Ch 28:1-10

11Then David gave Solomon

the plans for the vestibule, its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms,

the room for the mercy seat;

12the plan for everything he had in mind—the courts, surrounding rooms,

storehouses, and storehouses of dedicated things;

13the layout for the divisions of priests and Levites,

the plans for the work of service,

the utensils for the service, 	1 Ch 28:11-13

14the golden utensils, the weight of gold for them;

the silver utensils, the weight of silver for them;

15the weight of gold for the golden lampstands and their golden lamps, the

weight of each lampstand and its lamps;

the weight of silver for the silver lampstands, the weight of each lampstand

and its lamps;

16the weight of gold for each table of showbread, and

the silver for the silver tables;

17pure gold for the forks, basins, and pitchers,

the golden bowls with the weight for each bowl, and for

the silver bowls with the weight for each bowl; 18and

for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and

gold for the model of the chariot for the cherubs that spread out their

wings and cover the Ark of the Covenant.

19The details of this pattern he made clear in writing from Yahveh’s hand. 	1 Ch 28:14-19

20Then David told Solomon,

“Be strong and courageous; don’t be afraid or intimidated. Yahveh’s with you. He won’t fail you or abandon you till the work is done. 21There are divisions of priests and Levites for serving in God’s Temple, and every willing man with skill will be with you for all kinds of service. The officials and the people will be entirely at your command.”	1 Ch 28:20-21

Offerings for the Temple

29:1David told the assembly,

“God alone has chosen Solomon.  He’s young and new to the work. It’s an important undertaking; the Temple won’t be for some mortal but for Yahveh God. 2I’ve provided as much material as I could: gold, silver, bronze, iron, and wood—plus large amounts of onyx, gems for settings, antimony, colored stones, marble—all kinds of precious stones. 3In addition, I’m giving my own gold and silver: 4113¼ tons 3,000 talents of gold from Ophir, 264¼ tons 7,000 talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the Temple, 5and the gold and silver items the craftsmen will make. Who will offer willingly, consecrating himself to Yahveh today?”

1 Ch 29:1-5

6The heads of families made freewill offerings, as did the tribal leaders, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the officers over the king’s work. 7They gave for the service of God’s Temple 188¾ tons 5,000 talents of gold, 185 lbs 10,000 darics of gold, 377½ tons 10,000 talents of silver, 679½ tons 18,000 talents of brass, and 3775 tons 100,000 talents of iron. 8Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9The people celebrated because they had given willingly and offered freely with all their heart. David also celebrated greatly.    	1 Ch 29:6-9

David’s Prayer of Praise

10He blessed Yahveh in the presence of the assembly,

“You’re blessed forever, Yahveh God of our ancestor Israel. 11You have the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty because everything in the sky and on earth belongs to you. The kingdom belongs to you, the exalted head over everything. 12Wealth and honor come from you. Power and strength are with you. Your control makes everyone great and strong. 13We thank you and praise your glorious name.

14“But who am I and what’s my people that we can offer as willingly as this? Everything comes from you, and what we’ve given you is from your own things. 15We’re foreigners, nomads like our ancestors. Our time on earth is like a shadow; it’s not permanent. 16This abundance we’ve provided for building you a Temple comes from you and belongs to you. 17I know you test the heart and are delighted with godliness. With a godly heart I’ve freely offered everything and seen your people offering freely and joyfully. 18Yahveh God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, always keep such purposes and thoughts in your people’s hearts and direct their hearts to you. 19Give Solomon my son a whole heart for keeping your commandments, testimonies, and statutes; and for accomplishing everything so he can build the Temple I’ve made provisions for.”  	1 Ch 29:10-19

Solomon Anointed as King

20Then David told the assembly, “Bless Yahveh your God.” The whole assembly blessed Yahveh God of their ancestors. They bowed their heads in worship to him, and paid homage to the king. 21They sacrificed to Yahveh, and the next day offered burnt offerings—1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs with their liquid offerings, and abundant sacrifices for all Israel. 22They ate and drank in Yahveh’s presence that day with great happiness.

They confirmed Solomon as king and anointed him as ruler for Yahveh and Zadok as priest. 23Solomon replaced David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him. 24The leaders, elite soldiers, and King David’s sons pledged allegiance to him. 25Yahveh highly elevated him in front of Israel and placed such royal majesty on him as hasn’t been on any other king in Israel.

The Death of David

26David ruled all Israel 27for 40 years, 7 in Hebron and for 33 in Jerusalem. 28He died at a good old age, full of wealth and honor, and Solomon reigned. 29The acts of King David, from first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer, The Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, and The Chronicles of Gad the Seer, 30with accounts of his rule and strength, and the

circumstances that came on him, on Israel, and on the surrounding kingdoms.	 1 Ch 29:20-30
