1 KINGS

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

David in His Old Age

1:1When King David got old, they covered him with blankets, but he still had the chills. 2His advisers told him, “Have us look for a young virgin so she can attend you, become your nurse, and lie in your arms to keep you warm.” 3They searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 4She became his nurse, but he didn’t have relations with her.

Adonijah Claims the Throne

5Adonijah Ben-Haggithfem pushed himself forward to make himself king. He prepared chariots and horsemen with 50 men to run ahead of him. 6His father had never crossed him by asking why he did something.  7He’d conferred with Joab Ben-Jeruiah and Abiathar the priest. They supported him. He was a handsome man, born after Absalom. 8But Zadok the priest, Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and The Three most elite soldiers, belonged to David, didn’t join him. 9Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and young grain-fed animals by the Rock of Zoheleth next to En-rogel. He invited his half-brothers, the king’s sons; and the men of Judah, the king’s aides. 10But he didn’t invite Nathan, Benaiah, The Three most elite soldiers, or his half-brother Solomon. 	1 Kg 1:1-10

11Nathan told Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother,

“Haven’t you heard that Adonijah has become king, and David our lord doesn’t know it? 12Take my advice and save your life and your son’s life. 13Go right now to King David and say, ‘Haven’t you sworn to me that Solomon will be king after you? Why has Adonijah become king?’ 14While you’re there, I’ll come in and confirm what you say.”

15Bathsheba went to the king’s bedroom; Abishag was helping him. 16Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself to him, and he asked, “What can I do for you?”

17She said,

“You swore to me by Yahveh your God that my son Solomon would be the next king. 18Adonijah has made himself king without you knowing it. 19He has sacrificed lots of oxen, grain-fed animals, and sheep, and invited your sons Abiathar and Joab, but not Solomon. 20My lord the king, Israel is looking to you to tell them who will sit on your throne. 21Otherwise, as soon as you die, my son and I will be considered adversaries.”	 1 Kg 1:11-21

22While she was talking, Nathan came. 23They told the king, “Nathan’s here.” When he came in, he bowed low 24and said,

“My lord the king, have you said Adonijah will be king? 25He’s gone down today and sacrificed lots of oxen, grain-fed calves, and sheep and invited your sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar. They’re eating and drinking with him, and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 26But he hasn’t invited me, Zadok, Benaiah, or Solomon. 27Have you done this without telling us?”

David Appoints Solomon as King

28King David answered, “Call Bathsheba.” She came in and faced him. 29He vowed,

“As sure as Yahveh lives who has redeemed me from distress, 30as sure as I swore to you by Yahveh God of Israel that your son Solomon would be king after me, I’ll declare it publicly today.”

31She bowed to the floor and said, “Long live my lord King David!”	  1 Kg 1:22-31

32David said, “Call Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah.” When they came in, 33he told them,

“Take my officials with you, have Solomon ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon. 34Have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king. Blow the ram’s horn and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 35Then come up behind him. He’ll come and sit on my throne. I’ve appointed him to rule Israel and Judah.”

36Benaiah answered,

“Amen! So may Yahveh your God say, 37‘As Yahveh has been with you, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than yours!’”

38Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the king’s bodyguard went down and had Solomon ride David’s mule to Gihon. 39Zadok took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram’s horn and the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” 40The people followed him up, playing flutes and celebrating. The ground shook at the sound of them.	1 Kg 1:32-40

41Adonijah and his guests heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the ram’s horn, he said, “Why is the city in such an uproar?” 42While he was speaking, Jonathan Ben-Abiathar came. Adonijah said, “Come in, brave man with good news.” 43But Jonathan answered,

“No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 44He sent with him Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the king’s bodyguard. They’ve had him ride the king’s mule. 45Zadok and Nathan anointed him king at Gihon and have come up celebrating. That’s why the city’s in an uproar. 46Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne. 47The king’s aides came to bless our lord King David and say, ‘May your God make Solomon’s name better than your name and his throne greater than yours!’ 48The king also said, ‘Bless Yahveh God of Israel, who has granted a man to sit on my throne today while I can see it.’” 	1 Kg 1:41-48

49Adonijah’s guests panicked and fled. 50Adonijah was scared of Solomon. He went and held onto the horns of the altar. 51Solomon heard, “Adonijah is scared. He’s holding onto the horns of the altar and calling for you to swear to him that you won’t put him to death.”

52Solomon said, “If he’ll be a worthy man, not a hair of his will fall to the ground. But if he does anything sinful, he’ll die.” 53King Solomon had them bring him down from the altar. He came and prostrated himself to Solomon. He told him to go on home.    	     1 Kg 1:49-53

David’s Instructions to Solomon

2:1As David’s time to die came closer, he charged Solomon,

2“I’m going the way of all the earth. So be strong, show yourself to be a man. 3Keep the charge of Yahveh your God, follow him, keep his statutes, commandments, ordinances, and testimonies written in the Law of Moses. Then you can succeed at everything you do. 4Yahveh will carry out his promise to me, ‘If your descendants follow me sincerely with their heart and soul, you’ll always have one on Israel’s throne.’ 5You also know what Joab did to me and the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner and Amasa that he murdered. He shed the blood of war in the time of peace. He put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. 6Act wisely; don’t let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace. 7But be kind to the descendants of Barzillai the Gileadite. Have them eat at your table. They helped me when I was eluding your half-brother Absalom. 8Shimei Ben-Gera is with you. He cursed me with violent curses when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to me at the Jordan, I swore to him by Yahveh that I wouldn’t put him to death with the sword. 9Don’t you let him go unpunished. You’re a wise man; send his gray hair down to Sheol with blood.”

The Death of David

10David died and they buried him in The City of David. 11He’d ruled Israel for 40 years, 7 in Hebron and 33 in Jerusalem. 12Solomon sat on his throne, and his kingdom became secure.

1 Kg 2:1-12

Solomon’s Throne Established

13Adonijah went to Bathsheba.

She said, “Are you coming in peace?”

“Yes. 14I have something to say to you.”

“Say it.”

15“You know that the kingdom was mine as oldest heir and that Israel supposed I would be king. But the kingdom has been turned around and become my half-brother’s; it was his from Yahveh. 16I’m making one request. Don’t refuse me.”

“What is it?”

17“Please speak to Solomon about giving me Abishag as a wife. He won’t refuse you.”

18“I’ll speak to him.”	 1 Kg 2:13-18

19Bathsheba went to King Solomon, and the king rose to meet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. Then he had a throne set for the queen mother on his right. 20She said, “I’m making one small request. Don’t refuse me.”

“Ask, Mother; I won’t refuse you.”

21“Give Abishag to Adonijah your half-brother as a wife.”

22“Why are you asking for Abishag for Adonijah? Ask for the kingdom too—because he’s my oldest half-brother—even for him, Abiathar, and Joab!” 23Solomon swore by Yahveh,

“God do so to me and more if Adonijah hasn’t said that against his own life. 24As sure as Yahveh lives who made me secure on my father’s throne and made me a family like he promised, I’ll execute Adonijah today.”

25He sent Benaiah to execute him.

26Then the king told Abiathar,

“Go to your farm in Anathoth. You should die, but I won’t do it now; you’ve carried the Ark of the Lord Yahveh in my father’s presence and suffered everything he did.”

27Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest in fulfillment of Yahveh’s word about the descendants of Eli in Shiloh.	 1 Kg 2:19-27

28The news came to Joab because Joab had followed Adonijah—though he hadn’t followed Absalom. Joab fled to Yahveh’s tent and held onto the horns of the altar. 29King Solomon learned that he was beside the altar and sent Benaiah to execute him.

30Benaiah went and told him, “The king says to come out.”

But he said, “I’ll die here.” Benaiah brought back word to the king.

31“Do like he said and bury him so you can remove from me and my father’s family the blood he shed for no reason. 32Yahveh will be bringing his blood back on his own head. He fell on two men more upright than he was and killed them with the sword unbeknownst to my father: Abner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa, commander of Judah’s army. 33Their blood will come back on the head of Joab and his descendants permanently. But may David, his descendants, his dynasty, and throne have lasting peace from Yahveh.” 	1 Kg 2:28-33

34Benaiah went up and fell on him, and they buried him at his house in the country. 35The king appointed Benaiah over the army and Zadok as priest to replace Abiathar.

36The king called for Shimei, “Build a house in Jerusalem and live here. 37If you cross the Kidron, you’ll be responsible for your own death.”

38“All right.” He lived in Jerusalem a good while.	     1 Kg 2:34-38

39But three years later, two of his servants ran away to Achish Ben-Maacah, king of Gath. People told him his servants were in Gath. 40He saddled his donkey, went to Achish in Gath to look for them, and brought them back. 41Solomon found out he’d gone, 42so he called him in,

“Didn’t I make you swear by Yahveh and solemnly warn you that the day you went anywhere else you’d surely die? You agreed. 43Why not keep your oath to Yahveh and my command? 44You’ve acknowledged your sin against my father; Yahveh will bring it back on your own head. 45But I’ll be blessed, and David’s throne will be secure with Yahveh permanently.”

46The king told Benaiah to execute him. That’s how the kingdom became secure for Solomon.

1 Kg 2:39-46

Solomon Asks for Wisdom

3:1Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh and brought his daughter to The City of David till he’d finished building his own palace, Yahveh’s temple, and the wall around Jerusalem. 2People were still sacrificing on the high places; Yahveh didn’t have a temple yet.

3Solomon loved Yahveh and followed his father’s statutes except he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 4He’d go to Gibeon to sacrifice, the great high place. He offered 1,000 burnt offerings on that altar. 5Yahveh appeared to him in a dream there at night,

“Ask what you want me to give you.”

6He said, “You’ve shown great enduring love to David as he followed after truth, goodness, and an upright heart toward you. You’ve given him a son to sit on his throne. 7Now, Yahveh my God, you’ve made me king, but I’m just a child. I don’t know how to manage affairs. 8I’m among the people you’ve chosen, people too numerous to count. 9Give me an intelligent mind to judge them, to distinguish good from bad. Who can judge this large nation?” 	1 Kg 3:1-9

10 What he asked for pleased Yahveh. 11He told him,

“Because you’ve asked for that instead of a long life, wealth, or the death of your enemies, 12I’ll give you what you asked for: a wise, discerning mind; there has never been anybody like you before or will be afterwards. 13I’ll also give you what you didn’t ask for: wealth and honor like no other king as long as you live. 14If you follow my ways and keep my statutes and commandments like your father did, I’ll lengthen your life.”

15Solomon woke up; it was a dream. He came to Jerusalem and stood in front of the Ark, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and held a banquet for his officials.	 1 Kg 3:10-15

Solomon’s Wise Ruling

16Two prostitutes came and stood in his presence. 17One woman said,

“My lord, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby. 18and three days later she had one. We were the only ones there. 19Her son died during the night because she lay on him. 20While I was sleeping, she got up and took my son and laid him in her arms and laid her dead son by me. 21When I got up in the morning to nurse him, he was dead. But when I looked closely, it wasn’t my son.”

22The other woman said, “No! the living one is mine. The dead one’s yours.”

The first woman said, “No! the dead one’s yours. The living one’s mine.”

23The king said, “One says, ‘This is my son that’s alive.’ The other says, ‘No! your son’s the dead one.’ 24Get me a sword.”

They brought him one.

25He said, “Cut the living child in two, and give half to one and half to the other.”

26The real mother spoke out because she was deeply moved over her son, “My lord, give her the living child! Don’t kill him!”

The other said, “He won’t be mine or yours. Cut him in two!”

27The king answered, “Give the first woman the living child. She’s his mother.” 28When Israel heard about the judgment he’d handed down, they respected him for the wisdom God had given him for administering justice.	  1 Kg 3:16-28

Solomon’s Officials and Governors

4:1Solomon ruled all Israel. 2These were his officials:

Azariah Ben-Zadok was priest.

3Elihoreph and Ahijah, Ben-Shisha, were secretaries.

Jehoshaphat Ben-Ahilud was recorder.

4Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada was the general over the army.

Zadok and Abiathar were priests.

5Azariah Ben-Nathan oversaw the deputies.

Zabud Ben-Nathan, a priest, was the king’s personal advisor.

6Ahishar governed the household.

Adoniram Ben-Abda oversaw forced labor.

7Solomon had 12 deputies who provided for him and his household, one per month per

year:

8Benhur in the hill country of Ephraim,	 1 Kg 4:1-8

9Bendeker in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;

10Benhesed in Arubboth, (Socoh and the land of Hepher belonged to him.)

11Benabinadab in all the height of Dor, (His wife was Solomon’s daughter

Taphath.)

12Baana Ben-Ahilud in Taanach, Megiddo, and Beth-shean, which is beside

Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abelmeholah as far as the

other side of Jokmeam;

13Bengeber in Ramoth-gilead, (The towns of Jair Ben-Manasseh, in Gilead,

belonged to him. He also had the region of Argob, in Bashan, 60 big towns with walls and bronze bars were also his.);

14Ahinadab Ben-Iddo in Mahanaim,

15Ahimaaz in Naphtali, (married Solomon’s daughter Basemath)

16Baana Ben-Hushai in Asher and Bealoth,

17Jehoshaphat Ben-Paruah in Issachar,

18Shimei Ben-Ela in Benjamin,

19Geber Ben-Uri in Gilead (the country of King Sihon the Amorite and

Og, king of Bashan. He was the only deputy in the land.)	1 Kg 4:7-19

Solomon’s Prosperity and Wisdom

20Judah and Israel were as numerous as sand on the shore. They were eating and drinking and celebrating. 21Solomon ruled the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served him his whole life.

22Solomon’s provisions for one day were

30 kors of fine flour and (330 bushels)

60 kors of meal, 	    (660 bushels)

2310 grain-fed oxen,

20 pasture-fed oxen, and

100 sheep besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl.

24He had dominion over the territory west of the Euphrates River from Tiphsah to Gaza. He had peace all around. 25Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and fig tree from Dan to Beersheba Solomon’s whole life. 26He had 40,000 stalls for horses for his chariots and 12,000 cavalry. 27For a month at a time, the deputies provided for him and everybody that came to his table; they left, not lacking anything. 28They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to where it should be, each according to his responsibility.   	1 Kg 4:20-28

29God gave Solomon wisdom, great discernment, and breadth of mind. 30His wisdom surpassed the wisdom of men in the East and in Egypt. 31He was wiser than anyone else—than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman; or Calcol and Darda, sons of Mahol. He was famous in the nations all around. 32He authored 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs. 33He knew about trees from the cedars in Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall. He talked about animals, birds, crawling things, and fish. 34People came from every nation to hear his wisdom, kings everywhere who’d heard about it. 	1 Kg 4:29-34

Preparations for Building the Temple

5:1Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to Solomon when he heard they’d anointed him king in place of his father. He’d always been a friend to David. 2Solomon sent him a message,

3“You know my father couldn’t build a temple for Yahveh his God because he carried on warfare till Yahveh put down his enemies. 4But now Yahveh has given me peace in every direction. There’s no adversary or misfortune. 5I intend to build a temple for Yahveh like he said, ‘Your son that I’ll set on your throne will build me a temple.’ 6Have your woodsmen cut cedars from Lebanon, and my workmen will work with yours. I’ll pay them whatever wages you set. You know there’s nobody among us that knows how to cut timber like Sidonians.”

7When Hiram heard what Solomon said, he was happy, “Bless Yahveh that’s given David a wise son over this great people.” 8He sent word to Solomon,

“I’ve heard your message. I’ll do what you want about the cedar and cypress timber. 9My workmen will bring it down from Lebanon to the sea, and tie it together in rafts to go by sea to where you designate. I’ll have them taken apart there for you to take away. Then you’ll satisfy me by feeding my household.”

10Hiram gave him as much cedar and cypress as he wanted. 11Each year Solomon gave him 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of wheat and 1800 gallons 20 kors of pressed olive oil for his household. 12Yahveh gave Solomon wisdom like he’d promised. Hiram and Solomon signed a peace treaty.

1 Kg 5:1-12

13King Solomon conscripted 30,000 laborers from all over Israel, 14and sent them to Lebanon in shifts of 10,000 a month. They worked in Lebanon a month and were home two months. Adoniram oversaw them. 15Solomon had 70,000 transporters and 80,000 stone cutters in the mountains, 16besides the 3,300 foremen that oversaw the project and managed the workmen. 17He commissioned them to quarry huge, high-quality stones for the foundation of the Temple. 18His and Hiram’s builders and workmen from the town of Gebal cut them and prepared the timbers and stones for the Temple.			     1 Kg 5:13-18

Solomon Builds the Temple

6:1In the 480th year after the Israelites left Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, the second month (Ziv), he started building Yahveh’s Temple. 2It was 90 x 30 x 45ft high. 3The vestibule across the nave was 30ft long—equal to the Temple’s width—and 15ft deep. 4He made recessed frames for the windows. 5He also built a three-story structure against the walls of the Temple, going around the nave and inner sanctuary, and made side rooms around the outside. 6The first story was 7½ft wide, the middle one 9ft, and the third 10½ft; because on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the Temple all the way around so the beams didn’t insert into the Temple walls. 7While the Temple was being built, the stones were prepared at the quarry. There wasn’t any sound of hammer, axe, or iron tool on site. 8The entry for the lowest side room was on the right side of the Temple. People could go up winding stairs to the middle and third stories. 9He built the Temple and finished it with beams and cedar planks 10in addition to the three stories, each 7½ft high, resting against the Temple on cedar timbers.	1 Kg 6:1-10

11A message from Yahveh came to Solomon,

12“As to this Temple you’re building, if you follow my statutes, carry out my ordinances, and keep my commandments, I’ll keep the promise with you that I made to your father. 13I’ll live among the Israelites and not abandon my people.”

14Solomon finished building the Temple.

15He paneled the inside of the walls with cedar boards from floor to ceiling and overlaid the floor with cypress boards. 16Inside the back of the Temple, he separated off the inner sanctuary 30ft deep, the Holy of Holies. 17The nave in front of it was 60ft long. 18The cedar all over the inside of the temple was decorated with carved shapes of gourds and open flowers. No stone was showing. 19He prepared the inner sanctuary for the Ark of Yahveh’s Covenant, 2030 x 30 x 30ft high and overlaid with pure gold. He overlaid the altar with cedar. 21He drew gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary and overlaid the rest of the interior with gold. 22He overlaid the whole Temple with gold as well as the altar by the inner sanctuary.	1 Kg 6:11-22

23-26In the inner sanctuary he made 2 identical cherubs out of olive wood, each 15ft tall 24with wings 7½ft long and their tips 15ft apart. 27He placed the cherubs in the middle of the inner room with their wings spread out so the wing of one touched one wall, the wing of the other touched the opposite wall, and their other wings touched in the center of the Temple. 28He overlaid them with gold.

29He carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on the walls of the inner and outer sanctuaries, 30and overlaid both floors with gold. 31-32The entrance to the inner sanctuary was 2 doors out of olive wood with a lintel and 5-sided doorposts, with carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on them; and overlaid them with gold. 33For the entrance to the nave, he made 4-sided doorposts out of olive wood 34and 2 doors of cypress wood. Both leaves of both doors folded in on pivots. 35He carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on them; and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. 36He built the wall of the inner court with 3 courses of cut stone capped by a layer of cedar beams.

37In the fourth year, the month Ziv, the foundation of Yahveh’s Temple was in place. 38In the eleventh year, eighth month (Bul), it was finished as designed. It took 7 years to build.

Solomon Builds His Palace	    1 Kg 6:23-38

7:1It took 13 years to build Solomon’s palace.

2He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon: 150 x 75 x 45ft high. It rested on 4 rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars. 3It had cedar panels above the side-rooms that were on the 45 pillars, 15 to a row. 4There were 3 rows of window frames with window across from window in three ranks. 5All the doorways and doorposts had square frames.

6He made the Hall of Pillars: 75 x 45ft with a porch in front and pillars, and a threshold in front of them.

7He built the Hall of the Throne, where he would judge, the Hall of Judgment, paneled with cedar from floor to rafters.

8The palace where he’d live and the other court inward from the hall had the same workmanship.

He made similar quarters for Pharaoh’s daughter that he’d married. 9These were made out of expensive stones, cut to size with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and so on the outside to the great court.	1 Kg 7:1-9

10The foundation consisted of huge, expensive stones, some 12ft and 15ft long. 11Above were expensive stones cut to size—and cedar. 12The great court had 3 courses of cut stone all around capped by a layer of cedar beams like the inner court of Yahveh’s Temple and its porch.

The Temple Furnishings

13King Solomon sent for Hiram/Huram of Tyre, a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali. His father was from Tyre, a worker in bronze. 14He was filled with wisdom, insight, and skill for doing any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon to do his work.

15Hiram/Huram fashioned 2 pillars of bronze 27ft tall and 18ft in circumference. 16He made 2 capitals out of molten bronze to set on top of the pillars, each 7½ft tall. 17There were 7 sets of latticework and interwoven chains for the capitals. 18Hiram circled 200 pomegranates in 2 rows around the latticework on each capital, 19and each had a lily design 6ft tall. 20The capitals were close to the rounded projection that was beside the latticework. 21So he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave. The left pillar he named Boaz, and the right one, Jachin. 22The capitals on the pillars there were shaped like water lilies. That finished the work on the pillars. 	1 Kg 7:10-22

23Hiram/Huram made the sea out of cast metal 15ft from brim to brim. It was 7½ft tall and 45ft in circumference. 24Under its brim, gourds went all the way around it, 10 to each 1½ft. The gourds were in 2 rows, cast with the rest. 25The sea rested on 12 oxen, 3 each facing north, west, south, and east, and their hind quarters aimed inward. 26It was a handbreadth thick with a brim like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold 18,000 gallons.	 1 Kg 7:23-26

27Then Hiram/Huram made 10 bronze stands, each 6 x 6 x 4½ft high. 28They had braces between the frames 29decorated with lions, oxen, and cherubs. On the frames there was a pedestal above with lions and oxen, and wreaths of hanging work below. 30Each stand had 4 bronze wheels with bronze axles. There were 4 supports under the basins with wreath decorations on each side. 31Its opening was within a crown that stuck up 18ins. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round. 32The 4 wheels were under the panels, and their axels of one piece with the stands. The wheels were 27ins tall, 33made like chariot wheels with their axels, rims, spokes, and hubs cast in one piece from molten bronze. 34There were 4 supports at the 4 corners of each stand made of one piece with the stands. 35On top of the stand was a round band 18ins high with stays and borders of one piece with it. 36On the surfaces of its stays and borders, he carved cherubs, lions, and palm trees according to the space of each, with wreaths all around. 37He made 10 such stands, cast alike, the same size and shape.	 1 Kg 7:27-37

38He made 10 bronze basins, 1 for each stand. Each basin held 360 gallons and measured 6ft across. 39He set the stands 5 on the south side of the Temple and 5 on the north side, and set the sea at the southeast corner of the Temple.

40Hiram/Huram also made pots, shovels, and basins. He finished everything for King Solomon on Yahveh’s Temple: 41the 2 pillars, 2 bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars, 2 networks to cover the 2 bowls—42400 pomegranates for the 2 networks in 2 rows per network; 4310 stands and the 10 lavers on them, 44the sea and the 12 oxen under it.	1 Kg 7:38-44

45He made the pots, shovels, and basins out of burnished bronze. 46The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 47Solomon didn’t calculate the weight of the bronze or the items; there were too many.

48Solomon made the furniture for Yahveh’s Temple: the golden altar, golden table for the Bread of the Presence, 49lampstands of pure gold—5 on the south side and 5 on the north in front of the inner sanctuary. He made the flowers, lamps, and tongs out of gold; 50the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans out of pure gold; and the sockets for the doors of the Holy of Holies and for the nave of the Temple out of gold.

51Solomon finished the work on Yahveh’s Temple. He brought in the silver, gold, and articles David had dedicated, and stored them in theY Temple treasuries. 	1 Kg 7:45-51

The Ark Brought to the Temple

8:1-2In Jerusalem Solomon gathered Israel’s elders, heads of tribes, and leaders of families. They gathered at the festival in the seventh month (Ethanim) to bring up the Ark of the Covenant from The City of David (Zion). 3The priests picked up the Ark 4and brought it up with the Tent of Meeting along with the holy items that were in it. The priests and Levites brought them up. 5King Solomon and the whole community sacrificed more sheep and oxen than you could count. 6The priests brought the Ark to its place in the inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies. 7The cherubs spread out their wings over it and its poles. 8The poles were long enough for their ends to be visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from the outside. They’re still there. 9Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets Moses put there at Horeb/Sinai, where Yahveh made covenant with Israel. 10When the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the Temple. 11They couldn’t carry out their service because Yahveh’s glory filled the Temple.      	1 Kg 8:1-11

Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication

12Then Solomon said,

“You’veY said you’d be in the dark cloud.

13I’ve built you a glorious temple, a permanent place to live.”

14Then he faced the people and blessed the assembly standing there,

15“Bless Yahveh God of Israel who told my father David, 16‘From the time I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I hadn’t chosen a city to build a temple in so my name would be there, but I chose David to rule my people.’ 17My father wanted to build him a temple, 18but Yahveh said he meant well, 19but he wouldn’t build it; his son would. 20Yahveh has kept that promise; I’ve risen to Israel’s throne and built him a temple. 21That’s where I’ve set the Ark that holds the covenant he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.”

1 Kg 8:12-21

22Then Solomon stood at the altar and spread out his hands toward heaven.

23“Yahveh God of Israel, there’s no God like you in the sky or on earth because you keep covenant and show enduring love to your servants that follow you with all their heart. 24You’ve kept your promise to my father. 25Keep this one, too, ‘You’ll always have a descendant on your throne if they follow me like you have.’ 26Confirm that promise now.

27“But will you live on earth? Sky and heaven can’t contain you, much less this Temple I’ve built! 28Yet answer my prayer. Listen to my call 29so you’ll be looking toward this Temple day and night where you’ve put your name. 30Listen when your people and I pray toward here.

31“When someone sins against another and comes here to take an oath at your altar, 32then listen from heaven and judge them. Punish sinners by bringing their way on their own head, and justify the good by rewarding them according to their goodness.

33“When an enemy defeats your people because they’ve sinned, if they repent, confess your name, and make petition in this Temple, 34then listen from heaven, forgive them, and bring them back to the country you’ve given their ancestors.

35“When there’s no rain because they’ve sinned against you and they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin when you punish them, 36then listen from heaven and forgive your people. Teach them the good way to live and send rain on the land you’ve given them to inherit.	1 Kg 8:31-36

41“When a foreigner comes from a distant country 42because of your great name, your powerful hand, and outstretched arm, and prays toward this Temple, 43then listen from heaven where you live, and do everything he calls to you for so every nation will know you and respect you like your people do.

44“When your people go out to battle in whatever direction you send them, and they pray to you toward this city you’ve chosen and the Temple I’ve built, 45then listen from heaven and support their cause.

Have their captors show them mercy (51because they’re the inheritance you brought out of Egypt, the iron furnace). 52Open your eyes to my petition and to your people Israel, to listen whenever they call. 53You’ve separated them off from all the other nations as your inheritance, Lord Yahveh, like you said through Moses when you brought them out of Egypt.”	1 Kg 8:44-53

54When Solomon had finished that prayer, he stood up from kneeling with his hands spread toward heaven 55and blessed Israel with a loud voice,

56“Blessed be Yahveh, who has given his people rest like he promised. Not a word of his promise through Moses has failed. 57May he be with us like he was with our ancestors, 58and incline our hearts toward him, to follow the statutes and ordinances he commanded them. 59May my petition come near him day and night so he’ll support the cause of his servant and of Israel as each day requires. 60Then the whole world can know Yahveh is God and no other. 61Devote your hearts to him completely, follow his statutes, and keep his commandments like you’re doing today.”

The Dedication of the Temple

62The king and all Israel offered sacrifices and peace offerings to Yahveh: 6322,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. That’s how the king and Israel dedicated Yahveh’s Temple. 64The same day, he consecrated the middle of the court in front of it, because he offered there the burnt offering, grain offering, and fat of the peace offerings. The bronze altar was too small to hold them. 65Solomon and all Israel observed the festival for 14 days, a huge assembly from Lebo-hamath to the River of Egypt, in the presence of Yahveh our God. 66The next day he dismissed the people, and they blessed the king. They went home happy for the goodness Yahveh had shown David his servant and Israel his people.	1 Kg 8:54-66

Yahveh Appears to Solomon

9:1When Solomon had finished building Yahveh’s Temple, the king’s palace, and everything he wanted to do, 2Yahveh appeared to him a second time like he did at Gibeon.

3“I’ve heard your prayer and consecrated this Temple you’ve built by putting my name there permanently. My eyes and heart will always be there. 4If you’ll follow me like your father did in the integrity of heart and godliness, do everything I tell you, keep my statutes and ordinances, 5then I’ll make your throne secure over Israel permanently like I promised David, ‘You’ll always have a descendant on Israel’s throne.’

6“But if you or your sons turn away from me to serve and worship other gods, 7I’ll remove Israel from the land I’ve given them, and throw away the Temple I’ve consecrated. Israel will become a proverb, a byword among the nations. 8This Temple will become a pile of ruins. Everybody that goes by will be amazed and gasp, ‘Why has Yahveh done this to this land and this Temple?’ 9People will say, ‘Because they forsook Yahveh their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They adopted other gods and worshiped and served them.’”        	         1 Kg 9:1-9

Solomon’s Agreement with Hiram

10At the end of the 20 years it took him to build Yahveh’s Temple and the king’s palace, King Solomon gave Hiram 20 towns in Galilee. (11Hiram, king of Tyre, had supplied him with all the cedar, cypress, and gold he wanted.) 12Hiram came out from Tyre to see them, but he didn’t like them. 13“What are these towns you’ve given me, brother?” They’re still called The Land of Cabul [A Land as Good as Nothing]. 14Nevertheless, Hiram sent Solomon 4½ tons 120 talents of gold.

Solomon’s Other Achievements

15This is the conscripted labor King Solomon levied to build Yahveh’s Temple, his own palace, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 16Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer, burned it, killed the Canaanites in it, and gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 17Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the Lower Beth-horon, 18Baalath, Tamar in the Wilderness of Judah, 19his storage cities, cities for his chariots and cavalry, and everything he wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and the land he ruled. 20To this day Solomon has conscripted laborers from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites 21that Israel couldn’t destroy. 22But he didn’t conscript Israelites for forced labor. They were soldiers, officials, officers, captains, chariot commanders, and cavalry.   	1 Kg 9:10-22

23550 chief officers oversaw Solomon’s work.

24As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from The City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he built the Millo.

25Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he built to Yahveh, burning incense with them.

And so he finished the Temple.

26He also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in Edom. 27Hiram sent experienced seamen with the fleet along with Solomon’s men. 28They went to Ophir and brought back 15¾ tons 420 talents of gold to Solomon.    	1 Kg 9:23-28

The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon

10:1When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon’s fame that honored Yahveh, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. 2She came with a large retinue, and with camels carrying spices, lots of gold, and precious stones. She talked to him about everything that was on her mind. 3He answered all her questions and explained everything. 4She saw his wisdom, the palace he’d built, 5the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway up to Yahveh’s Temple. It took her breath away.

6“What I heard in my country about your words and wisdom was true. 7But I didn’t believe it till I saw it. I hadn’t heard half of it. You exceed the report I heard about your prosperity. 8How fortunate your officials are, being around you continually and listening to your wisdom! 9Bless Yahveh your God who delighted to set you on Israel’s throne. Because he loved Israel forever, he made you king to do justice and goodness.”

10She gave him 4½ tons 120 talents of gold and large amounts of spices and precious stones. Never again did such an abundance of spices come in as she brought him.

11Hiram’s ships that brought gold from Ophir also brought large quantities of almug wood and precious stones. 12From the almug wood, the king made railings for Yahveh’s Temple and his own palace, as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Such almug wood hasn’t come in again or been seen since.

13King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for besides what he gave her on his own. Then she and her attendants went back to her country.	 1 Kg 10:1-13

Solomon’s Wealth and Splendor

14Each year, 25¼ tons 666 talents of gold came in to Solomon 15besides what came in from traders, merchants’ wares, the kings of Arabia, and governors of the country. 16He made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 15 lbs 600 shekels of gold on each one. 17He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using 3¾ lbs 3 minas of gold on each one. He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 18In addition, he made a large throne out of ivory, overlaid with refined gold. 19There were 6 steps up to it, a round top on the back of it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside them. 2012 lions stood on the 2 sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 21His drinking cups were made out of gold; the items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There weren’t any silver ones; it wasn’t considered valuable in his time. 22At sea he had the ships of Tarshish with Hiram’s ships. Every three years ships came from Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.

23King Solomon became wealthier and wiser than all the other kings in the world. 24The whole world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God had put in him. 25Everybody brought a gift, silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much each year. 	1 Kg 10:14-25

26Solomon gathered 1,400 chariots and 12,000 calvary and stationed them in chariot cities and in Jerusalem. 27He made silver as common as stone in Jerusalem, and cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lower western hills. 28His merchants obtained horses from Egypt and Kue for a price. 29He imported Egyptian chariots for 15 lbs 600 shekels of silver each and horses for 3¾ lbs 150 shekels of silver apiece. Then he exported them to the kings of the Hittites and of Aram.  	    1 Kg 10:26-29

Solomon’s Wives

11:1King Solomon loved many foreign women along with Pharaoh’s daughter: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women. 2They came from the nations Yahveh had told the Israelites not to associate with, “They’ll turn your heart away after their gods.” Solomon held fast to them in love. 3He had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines. 4When he was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods. He wasn’t wholly devoted to Yahveh like David was. 5Solomon went after Ashtoreth, goddess of the Sidonians; and Milcom, the detestable idol of the Ammonites. 6He did what was sin and didn’t follow Yahveh faithfully. 7He built a high place for Chemosh, detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain east of Jerusalem, and for Molech, detestable idol of the Ammonites. 8He did that for all his foreign wives, whopl burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.	 1 Kg 11:1-8

9Yahveh was angry with him because he turned his heart away. The God of Israel had appeared to him twice, 10and commanded him not to go after other gods. But he didn’t obey that command. 11God told him,

“Because you’ve done this and haven’t kept my covenant and statutes, I’ll tear the kingdom from you and give it to one of your servants. 12But for David’s sake, I won’t do it in your lifetime. I’ll tear it away from your son, 13but not all of it. I’ll give him one tribe for the sake of David and Jerusalem that I’ve chosen.”

Solomon’s Adversaries

14Yahveh raised up Hadad the Edomite against Solomon. He was from the royal line. 15When David was in Edom, Joab, commander of the army, had gone up to bury the slain and strike down every male in Edom. (16Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he’d killed every male in Edom.) 17Hadad fled to Egypt with some of his father’s officials when he was a boy. 18They left Midian and went to Paran. They took people with them from Paran and went on to Pharaoh. He gave him a house and land and assigned him food. 19He came to like Hadad so much that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes. 20She had Hadad’s son Genubath and weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace. Genubath was in Pharaoh’s palace with his sons. 21But when Hadad heard that David had died and Joab was dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me leave so I can go to my own country.”

22“What have you lacked with me?”

“Nothing; but you need to let me go.” 	1 Kg 11:14-22

23God raised up another adversary, Rezon Ben-Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer, king of Zobah. 24-25He gathered men and led a marauding band after David killed the people in Zobah. They went to Damascus and ruledpl Aram from there. He hated Israel and was its adversary all of Solomon’s life like Hadad was.

Jeroboam Rebels Against Solomon

26Jeroboam Ben-Nebat rebelled against Solomon. He was an Ephraimite from Zeredah, one of Solomon’s officials, whose mother was Zeruah, a widow. 27He rebelled when Solomon was building the Millo and closing up the breach in The City of David. 28Jeroboam was a trained soldier. When Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over the forced labor of Joseph’s house. 29During that time, when Jeroboam left Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. Ahijah had dressed in a new cloak, and both of them were alone in a field. 30Ahijah took his new cloak and tore it into 12 pieces. 31He told Jeroboam,

“Take ten pieces. Yahveh says, ‘I’ll tear the kingdom away from Solomon and give you ten tribes (32but he’ll have one tribe, for the sake of David and Jerusalem, the city I’ve chosen from the tribes). 33They’ve left me and worshiped Ashtoreth goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh god of Moab, and Milcom god of the Ammonites. They haven’t done what I’ve considered right or observed my statutes and ordinances like David did. 34I won’t take the whole kingdom away from Solomon. I’ll let him rule all his life for David’s sake, 35but I’ll take ten tribes away from his son and give them to you. 36I’ll give his son one tribe so David will always have a lamp in Jerusalem, the city I’ve chosen to identify with. 37I’ll take you, and you’ll reign over whatever you desire and be king of Israel. 38If you listen to everything I tell you like David did, I’ll be with you and build you an enduring dynasty like I built for David. 39That’s how I’ll punish David’s descendants for this, but not forever.’”

40Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he fled to Shishak {Shoshenq I}, king of Egypt, and stayed there till Solomon died.

Solomon’s Death

41The rest of what Solomon did and his wisdom are recorded in The Book of the Acts of Solomon. 42He ruled Israel in Jerusalem for 40 years. 43When he died, they buried him in The City of David. His son Rehoboam reigned.	    1 Kg 11:23-43

The Northern Tribes Rebel Against Rehoboam

12:1Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had come there to make him king. 2Jeroboam heard about it in Egypt. (3They sent and called him.) Jeroboam and all Israel came and told Rehoboam, 4“Your father made our yoke hard. Lighten his hard service and his heavy yoke, and we’ll serve you.” 5He said, “Leave for three days, then come back.” So they left.

6King Rehoboam consulted with the elders that had served Solomon, “How do you advise me to answer the people?” 7They said, “If you’ll serve this nation today, grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, they’ll serve you permanently.” 8But he dismissed their advice and consulted with the young men he grew up with and served him. 9“What’s your advice about answering the people, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?” 10The young men said,

“Tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 11My father loaded you with a heavy yoke; I’ll add to it. My father disciplined you with whips; I’ll discipline you with scorpions.’”

12Then Jeroboam and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day. 13The king answered them harshly. He didn’t take the elders’ advice 14and spoke to them according to the young men’s advice, “My father made your yoke heavy; I’ll add to it. My father disciplined you with whips; I’ll discipline you with scorpions.” 15He ignored the people, a turn of affairs Yahveh let happen to bring about what he’d told Jeroboam through Ahijah of Shiloh.	     1 Kg 12:1-15

16When Israel saw that he didn’t listen, they answered him,

“What part do we have in David?

Israel went home, 17but Rehoboam ruled the Israelites that lived in Judah. 18He sent Adoram, supervisor over forced labor, and Israel stoned him to death. Rehoboam hurried and got in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. 19Israel has been in rebellion against David’s descendants ever since. 20When all Israel heard that Jeroboam was back, they called him to the assembly and crowned him king of all Israel.

“The kingdom will revert to David’s descendants. 27If the people go up to offer sacrifices in Yahveh’s Temple at Jerusalem, their hearts will go back to Rehoboam, and they’ll kill me.”

28So he made two gold calves and said, “It’s too much trouble to go up to Jerusalem. Look, your gods, Israel, that brought you up from Egypt!” 29He set one in Bethel and the other in Dan. 30That thing became a sin because the people went to worship at the one as far as Dan. 31He made houses on high places and appointed priests from among the people that didn’t descend from Levi. 32-33He instituted a festival in Bethel on the fifteenth day, eighth month like the festival in Judah.

“Altar, altar, Yahveh says, ‘A son named Josiah will be born among David’s descendants. He’ll sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you. He’ll burn human bones on you.’”

3He gave a sign the same day,

“Yahveh has given this sign: the altar will open up and ashes pour out.”

4When the king heard what the man of God said, he reached out from the altar and said, “Arrest him!” But his hand froze, and he couldn’t draw it back. 5The altar split apart and ashes poured out like the sign had said. 6The king answered the man of God, “Ask Yahveh your God to restore my hand.”

“Yes.”

15“Come home with me and eat bread.”

16“I can’t return with you, eat bread, or drink water with you here. 17Yahveh told me not to eat bread, drink water, or go back the way I came.”

“Jeroboam’s wife is coming to ask about her son that’s sick. Tell her such and such; when she gets here, she’ll pretend to be another woman.”

6When Ahijah heard her footsteps coming in the door, he said,

“Come in, Jeroboam’s wife, why pretend to be another woman? I’m sent to you with a harsh message. 7Tell Jeroboam that Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘I lifted you up from among the people and made you Israel’s leader. 8I tore the kingdom away from David’s descendants and gave it to you. But you’ve not been like David. He kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart and did only what I said was right. 9You’ve done more evil than anybody before you. You’ve made other gods and molten images and tossed me aside. 10So I’ll bring catastrophe on your family: I’ll eliminate from you every male, bond or free, and consume your family like a person burns up manure. 11Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field; I’ve said so.’

Rehoboam Rules in Judah

21Rehoboam ruled in Judah. He was 41 when he became king and ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city Yahveh chose from the tribes of Israel to identify with. His mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 22Judah provoked Yahveh more than their ancestors did. 23They built high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every tall hill under every green tree. 24There were male cult prostitutes in the land. They did all the disgusting things the nations did that Yahveh originally drove out for Israel.	    1 Kg 14:21-24

25In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak [Shoshenq I], king of Egypt, came up and attacked Jerusalem. 26He took away the treasures in Yahveh’s Temple and the king’s palace, and everything Solomon had made, including the gold shields. 27Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard for the king’s palace. 28Whenever he went to the Temple, the guards would carry them and bring them back to the guardroom.

29The rest of the acts of Rehoboam are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 30War went on constantly between him and Jeroboam. 31He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Abijam became king.	    1 Kg 14:25-31

Abijam Rules in Judah

15:1In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam Ben-Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah 2and ruled for 3 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 3He did the sins his father did. His heart wasn’t wholly true to Yahveh like David’s was. 4But for David’s sake Yahveh gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, set up his descendant after him, and made Jerusalem secure. 5He did it because David did what was right and didn’t deviate from anything Yahveh commanded him his whole life—except in the matter about Uriah the Hittite. [6] 7The rest of the acts of Abijam are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 8He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Asa became king.

Asa Rules in Judah

9In the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Asa began to rule in Judah 10and ruled for 41 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 11Asa did what was right like David did. 12He

put the male cult prostitutes out of the country,

removed the idols his ancestors had made,

13removed his mother from being queen mother because she’d set up a detestable Asherah pole,

14cut it down and burned it at the Brook Kidron.

He didn’t take away the high places, but his heart was true to Yahveh his whole life. 15He brought to Yahveh’s Temple his and his father’s dedicated gifts—silver, gold, and various articles.	 1 Kg 15:1-15

16War went on between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, their whole lives. 17Baasha went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anybody from going out or coming to Asa. 18Then Asa took the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of Yahveh’s Temple and delivered it to his officials. He sent them to Benhadad Ben-Tabrimmon Ben-Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,

19“Let’s make a treaty like your father and my father did. I’ve sent you a gift of silver and gold. Break your treaty with Baasha so he’ll withdraw from me.”

20Benhadad listened to Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the towns in Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and Chinneroth, besides the land of Naphtali. 21When Baasha heard it, he stopped fortifying Ramah and stayed in Tirzah. 22Then Asa made a proclamation to Judah—no one was exempt—to carry away the stones of Ramah and its timber and fortify Geba in Benjamin and the town of Mizpah.

23The rest of the acts of Asa, the strength of his rule, the towns he built are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. In his old age, he had a disease in his feet. 24He died and they buried him with his ancestors in The City of David. His son Jehoshaphat reigned.

Nadab Rules in Israel

25Nadab Ben-Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa, king of Judah, and ruled for 2 years. 26He did evil like his father had done and got Israel to do. 27Then Baasha Ben-Ahijah from the tribe of Issachar plotted against him, and struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to it. 28Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa and began to reign. 29As soon as he became king, he killed everybody in Jeroboam’s family—like Yahveh had said by Ahijah of Shiloh. 30He did it because of the sins Jeroboam got Israel to do, and it made Yahveh God of Israel angry. 31The rest of the acts of Nadab are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 32There was war between Asa and Baasha their whole life.

Baasha Rules in Israel

16:1A message from Yahveh came to Jehu Ben-Hanani against Baasha:

2“Since I lifted you up from the dust to lead Israel, you’ve done what Jeroboam did and got Israel to do and made me angry by their sins. 3I’ll consume you and your family and make it like Jeroboam’s. 4Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field.”

5The rest of the acts of Baasha and the strength of his rule are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 6He died and they buried him in Tirzah. His son Elah became king. 7In addition, a message from Yahveh through the prophet Jehu came against Baasha and his dynasty. It came against him because of his sin that made Yahveh angry like Jeroboam’s dynasty did, and because he destroyed Jeroboam’s family.	1 Kg 16:1-7

Elah Rules in Israel

8In the twenty-sixth year of Asa, king of Judah, Elah became king of Israel at Tirzah and ruled for 2 years. 9 Zimri, commander of half his chariots, led a plot against him. Elah was at Tirzah getting drunk in the house of Arza, who managed the palace at Tirzah. 10Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa and became king. 11As soon as he became king, he killed Baasha’s family. He didn’t leave a single male among his relatives and friends. 12So Zimri destroyed Baasha’s family like Yahveh had said through the prophet Jehu.  13He delivered that message because of the sins Baasha and Elah did and got Israel to do with their idols and made Yahveh angry. 14The rest of the acts of Elah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.	 1 Kg 16:8-14

Zimri Rules in Israel

15In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, Zimri ruled for 7 days at Tirzah. The people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 16The people camped there heard that Zimri had struck down the king; so Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king of Israel that day in the camp. 17Then Omri and Israel went up from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah. 18When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortress of the king’s palace and burned it down over himself and died. 19He did it because of his sins, following the way of Jeroboam and getting Israel to sin. 20The rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

Omri Rules in Israel

21The people of Israel were divided: half followed Tibni Ben-Ginath and half followed Omri. 22But the ones that followed Omri prevailed. Tibni died and Omri became king. 23In the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah, Omri became king in Israel and ruled for 12 years, 6 in Tirzah. 24He bought the hill of Samaria from “Shemer” for 151 lbs two talents of silver, and built a city on it that he named Samaria after its owner. 25Omri did evil worse than anybody before him. 26He did everything Jeroboam did and got Israel to do. 27The rest of the acts of Omri and the strength he showed are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 28He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son Ahab became king.	 1 Kg 16:15-28

Ahab Rules in Israel

29Ahab became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa, king of Judah, and ruled Israel in Samaria for 22 years. 30He did evil worse than anybody before him. 31As though it had been a trivial thing for him to follow in the sins of Jeroboam, he married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, and went to serve and worship Baal. 32He erected an altar for Baal in a temple for Baal that he built for Baal in Samaria 33and set up an Asherah pole. He did more to provoke Yahveh God of Israel than any king of Israel before him.

34During his reign, Hiel from Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, in fulfillment of Yahveh’s message through Joshua Ben-Nun.	 1 Kg 16:29-34

Elijah Predicts a Drought

17:1Elijah the Tishbite, a settler in Gilead, told Ahab,

“As Yahveh God of Israel lives that I serve, there won’t be dew or rain the next several years except when I say so.”

2A message from Yahveh came to him,

3“Get away from here to the east and hide by Brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. 4You’ll drink from the stream, and I’ve commanded the ravens to provide for you there.”

5He went to live by Brook Cherith. 6Ravens brought him bread and meat morning and evening, and he drank from the stream. 7After a while it dried up because it hadn’t rained.

The Widow in Zarephath

8Then a message from Yahveh came to him, 9“Go to Zarephath, near Sidon, and stay. I’ve commanded a widow there to provide for you.” 10He went to Zarephath. When he came to the city gate, a widow was gathering sticks. He called to her, “Please get me a little water in a jug to drink.” 	1 Kg 17:1-10

11As she was going to get it, he called to her to bring him a piece of bread too.

12She said,

“As Yahveh your God lives, I don’t have any, just a handful of flour in a bowl and a little oil in a jug. I’m gathering a few sticks so I can fix it for us to eat and die.”

13Elijah told her,

“Don’t worry. Do what you’ve said but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out. Then you can make one for you and your boy. 14Yahveh God of Israel says the bowl of flour won’t get empty, and the jug of oil won’t go dry before it rains.”

15She did what he said; and she, her son, and household ate for many days. 16The bowl didn’t get empty, and the jug didn’t go dry.	 1 Kg 17:11-16

Elijah Resurrects the Widow’s Son

17After that, her little boy got sick, so sick he quit breathing. 18She said to Elijah, “What do I have to do with you, man of God? You’ve come to remind me of my sin and put my son to death!”

19“Give him to me.” He took him from her arms to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his own bed.

20He called out, “Yahveh my God, have you brought misfortune on the widow I’ve been staying with by causing her son to die?” 21He stretched out on the child three times and called out again, “Please bring him back.”

22Yahveh listened, and the child revived.

23Elijah brought him down to his mother. “See, he’s alive.”

24She told him, “Now I know for sure you’re a man of God and what you say from Yahveh is true.”	    1 Kg 17:17-24

Elijah Confronts Ahab

18:1In the third year, a message from Yahveh came to Elijah, “Present yourself to Ahab, and I’ll send rain.” 2So he went to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. 3Ahab called Obadiah, who managed the palace. (Obadiah respected Yahveh greatly. 4When Jezebel was destroying Yahveh’s prophets, he hid 100 of them by 50s in a cave and provided them bread and water.)

5“Go to the springs and valleys in the land. Maybe we’ll find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill any livestock.”

6They divided up the land to survey it. Ahab went one way and Obadiah went another.

7Elijah met Obadiah on the road. He recognized him and fell on his face, “Is that you, Elijah?”

8“It’s me. Go tell your master I’m here.”

9He said,

“How have I sinned that you’re turning me over to Ahab to execute me? 10As Yahveh your God lives, he’s searched for you in every nation and kingdom. When they said you weren’t there, he’d make the kingdom or nation swear they couldn’t find you. 11Now you’re telling me to go tell him you’re here. 12When I leave, the Spirit of Yahveh will carry you where I don’t know. When I tell Ahab and he can’t find you, he’ll kill me even though I’ve respected Yahveh my whole life. 13Haven’t you heard what I did when Jezebel was killing his prophets? I hid 100 of them by 50s in a cave and provided them bread and water? 14Now you want me to tell my master you’re here!”

15Elijah said, “As Yahveh of Hosts lives, I’ll present myself to Ahab today.”	1 Kg 18:1-15

16Obadiah went and told Ahab, and he came to meet Elijah. 17When Ahab saw him, he said, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”

18He said,

“I haven’t brought trouble on Israel. You and your father’s family have done that. You’ve abandoned Yahveh’s commandments and worshipped the images of Baal. 19Now then, gather Israel to me at Mount Carmel, along with the 450 Baal prophets and 400 Asherah prophets that eat at Jezebel’s table.”

The Contest on Mount Carmel

20Ahab sent a message among the Israelites and brought the prophets to Mount Carmel. 21Elijah faced the people and said, “How long will you waver between two sides? If Yahveh is God, follow him. If Baal is god, follow him.”

The people didn’t say anything. 	1 Kg 18:16-21

22Then Elijah told them,

“I’m the only prophet Yahveh has left; Baal has 450 of them. 23Let us have two oxen. They can choose one, cut it up, lay it on the wood, but not put any fire under it. I’ll prepare the other, lay it on the wood, and not put a fire under it. 24Then you call on your god, and I’ll call on Yahveh. The one that answers by fire, is God.”

The people answered, “That’s good.”

25Elijah told the Baal prophets, “Choose an ox and prepare it first; there are lots of you. Call on your god, but don’t put fire under it.” 26They prepared their ox and called on Baal from morning till noon, “Baal, answer us.” There was no answer. They leaped around the altar they’d made. 27At about noon Elijah mocked them, “Shout, because he’s a god. Either he’s occupied or has wandered off. Maybe he’s traveling or asleep and needs to be woke up.” 28As was their custom, they shouted and cut themselves with swords and lances till blood gushed out on them. 29When noon had passed, they raved till the time for evening sacrifice. But there wasn’t any voice, nobody answered, nobody paid attention. 	1 Kg 18:22-29

30Then Elijah told the crowd to come closer. He repaired Yahveh’s altar that had been torn down. 31He took 12 stones corresponding to the 12 tribes of Jacob, whose name Yahveh had changed to ‘Israel.’ 32With the stones, he rebuilt the altar in Yahveh’s name and dug a trench around it big enough to hold more than .73 of a bushel 2 seahs of seed. 33Then he arranged the wood, cut the ox in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He told them to fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood. 34“Do it again.” “Do it a third time.” 35The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench. 36Then at the time of evening sacrifice, he went up to the altar and said,

“Yahveh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, show today that you’re God in Israel, that I’m your servant, that you’ve told me to do this. 37Answer me so the people can know you’re God and that you’ve brought them back to you.”

38Fire came down from Yahveh and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, the dust, and the water in the trench. 39The people they fell on their faces, “Yahveh is God! Yahveh is God!” 40Elijah told them, “Seize the Baal prophets. Don’t let a one of them get away.” They seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon River and killed them.

Yahveh Sends Rain

41Elijah told Ahab, “Go get something to eat; there’s the sound of heavy rain.” 42Ahab went to eat. Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel and crouched down with his head between his knees. 43He told his servant to go look toward the sea. He went and looked, “There’s nothing.” He said, “Go back,” seven times. 44The seventh time, the servant said, “A cloud the size of a man’s hand is coming up from the horizon.” He said, “Go tell Ahab to get his chariot ready and go down so the rain doesn’t stop him.” 45In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a downpour came. Ahab rode to Jezreel. 46Yahveh was with Elijah, and he girded up and outran Ahab to Jezreel.  	1 Kg 18:38-46

Elijah Flees to Sinai

19:1Ahab told Jezebel what Elijah had done, and how he’d killed the prophets with the sword. 2She sent a messenger to Elijah, “The gods do so to me and more, if I don’t make your life like theirs by tomorrow at this time.” 3He fled for his life to Beersheba in Judah and left his attendant there. 4He went on a day’s journey into the open country and sat down under a juniper tree, “That’s enough, Yahveh. Take my life. I’m no better than my ancestors.” 5He lay down and slept under the tree, and an angel touched him, “Get up and eat.” 6He looked and at his head was a loaf of bread baked on hot stones and a jug of water. He ate and lay back down. 7An angel of Yahveh came a second time and touched him, “Get up and eat some more, or the trip will be too much for you.” 8He ate and on the strength of that food went for 40 days to Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God.	       1 Kg 19:1-8

Yahveh Speaks to Elijah

10He said,

“I’ve been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I’m the only one left, and they’re trying to kill me.”

11He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in my presence.” Yahveh was passing by! A gale was tearing the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces in Yahveh’s presence, but Yahveh wasn’t in the wind. After the wind an earthquake came, but Yahveh wasn’t in the earthquake. 12After the earthquake, fire came, but Yahveh wasn’t in the fire. After the fire the sound of a gentle whisper came. 13When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. A voice came to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 	1 Kg 19:9-13

“I’ve been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I’m the only one left, and they’re trying to kill me.”

15Yahveh told him,

“Go back on the road to the Wilderness of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram, 16anoint Jehu Ben-Nimshi king of Israel, and anoint Elisha Ben-Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. 17The one that escapes from Hazael’s sword, Jehu will kill, and the one that escapes from Jehu’s sword, Elisha will kill. 18I’ll preserve 7,000 in Israel, who haven’t bowed to Baal and haven’t kissed him.”

The Call of Elisha

19He left and found Elisha plowing with 12 yokes of oxen; he was with the twelfth. Elijah went over and threw his mantle on him. 20He left the oxen and ran after Elijah, “Let me kiss my parents. Then I’ll go with you.” He told him, “Go on back, but think about what I’ve done for you.” 21He went back, took a yoke of oxen, sacrificed them, and boiled their meat with the yokes. He gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up and followed Elijah as his assistant.

Ahab’s War with Syria

20:1Benhadad, king of Aram, gathered his army, 32 kings with horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege to Samaria and attacked it. 2He sent ambassadors to Ahab in the city, “Benhadad says, 3‘Your silver and gold are mine. Your most beautiful wives and children are mine too.’”

4The king of Israel said, “It’s according to your message, my lord king. I and everything I have are yours.”

5The ambassadors came back,

“This is what Benhadad said, ‘I sent to you saying, “You’ll give me your silver and gold, your wives and your children,” 6but about this time tomorrow I’ll send my officials to search your palace and your officials’ houses. They’ll carry off whatever you consider valuable.’”

7The king of Israel called the elders of the land, “See how this man is looking to make trouble; he sent for my wives, my children, my silver and gold. I didn’t tell him no.”

8The elders and the people advised, “Don’t agree to anything.” 	1 Kg 20:1-8

9He said to Benhadad’s ambassadors, “Tell my lord the king, ‘Everything you sent for the first time I’ll do, but I can’t do this.” The ambassadors took him that message.

11The king of Israel answered, “The one that puts on his armor shouldn’t brag like the one that takes it off.”

12When Benhadad heard it, he was drinking with the kings in temporary shelters and told his officers, “Take your positions.”

Ahab’s Victory over Ben-Hadad

They took their positions against the city.	 1 Kg 20:9-12

13A prophet approached Ahab, “Yahveh says: ‘I’ll deliver this big army to you today, and you’ll know I’m Yahveh.’”

14Ahab said, “Who’ll do it?”

“Yahveh says, ‘The young men of the rulers in the province.’”

“Who’ll begin the battle?”

“You.”

15He mustered the troops of the 232 provinces, 7,000 Israelites.

16They went out at noon while Benhadad was getting drunk in temporary shelters with his 32 allied kings. 17Israel’s troops went out first.

Benhadad sent out an inquiry, and they told him, “Troops have come out of Samaria.”

18“If they’ve come out either for peace or war, take them alive.”

19The troops came out of the city along with the entire army. 20They each killed their man, the Arameans fled, and Israel chased them. Benhadad escaped on a horse with the cavalry. 21The king of Israel struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans with a great slaughter.	1 Kg 20:13-21

22The prophet came to the king, “Make plans for another attack. At the first of the year, the king of Aram will come back.”

23Now the officers of Aram’s king told him,

“Their gods are mountain gods; so they were stronger than we were. Let’s fight them on the plains. We’ll surely be stronger than they are. 24Put a commander in place of each king. 25Muster an army like the one you’ve lost, horse for horse, chariot for chariot. Then fight them in the plain; we’ll surely be stronger than they are.”	1 Kg 20:22-25

26At the first of the year, Benhadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight Israel. 27The Israelites mustered, gathered provisions, and went to meet them. They camped there like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the countryside. 28Then a man of God came up and told the king of Israel,

“Yahveh says, ‘Because the Arameans have said I’m a mountain god, not a god of the valleys, I’ll give this great army to you; you’ll know I’m Yahveh.’”

29They camped against one another for a week. The seventh day, the battle began, and the Israelites killed 100,000 foot soldiers in one day. 30The rest fled into Aphek, and the wall fell on 27,000 more. Benhadad fled to the city into an inner room.	 1 Kg 20:26-30

31His officers told him, “We’ve heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Let’s put burlap around our waists and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel.

He said, “Is my brother still alive.”

A Prophet Condemns Ahab’s Release

33The officers quickly picked up on his word and said, “Your brother Benhadad.” He said, “Go bring him here.” Benhadad came out, and he took him up into the chariot.

34Benhadad told him, “I’ll restore the towns my father took from your father, and you’ll make streets in Damascus like my father did in Samaria.” Ahab said, “And I’ll let you go with this treaty.” He made a treaty with him and let him go.	 1 Kg 20:31-34

35One man from the company of prophets said to another by a message from Yahveh, “Strike me,” but he wouldn’t do it. 36“Because you’ve ignored Yahveh, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.” That’s what happened.

37He found another man, “Strike me.” He struck him and wounded him.

38The prophet left and waited for the king by the road. He disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. 39As the king went by, he shouted,

“I went into the battle, and a man brought a fellow over and said, ‘Guard this man. If he’s missing for any reason, it’s your life for his, or you’ll pay 75½ lbs a talent of silver.’ 40While I was busy here and there, he got away.”

The king told him, “That’s what your judgment will be. You’ve decided it yourself.”

41Right away he took the bandage off his eyes, and the king recognized he was one of the prophets. 42He told him, “Yahveh says, since you let the man go that he’d devoted to destruction, it’s your life for his and your people for his.’”

Naboth’s Vineyard

21:1After this, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel beside King Ahab’s palace. 2Ahab spoke to him about it, “Give me your vineyard so I can use it for a vegetable garden; it’s close to my palace. I’ll trade you a better vineyard for it.”

3But Naboth said, “Yahveh forbid me from giving you my ancestors’ inheritance.”

4Ahab went home sullen and resentful. He lay down on his bed and turned away and wouldn’t eat.

6“I asked Naboth to let me buy his vineyard or trade him for another one, but he wouldn’t do it.’” 	1 Kg 21:1-6

7Jezebel said, “Do you rule Israel? Get up, eat something, and be happy.

Then take him out and stone him.”

11The elders and nobles 12declared a fast and put Naboth in a prominent place. 13The two worthless fellows came in and sat down with him, and started accusing him of cursing God and the king. They took him outside the city and stoned him, 14and sent word to Jezebel. 15She told Ahab, “Go take Naboth’s vineyard; he’s dead.” 16He got up to go down and take it. 	1 Kg 21:7-16

20Ahab said, “Have you found me, my enemy?”

“I’ve found you because you’ve sold yourself to doing evil in Yahveh’s presence. 21‘I’ll bring evil on you and completely sweep you away. I’ll remove from you every male in Israel, bond or free, 22and make your dynasty like Jeroboam’s and Baasha’s; you’ve made me angry and got Israel to sin.’ 23Yahveh has also said dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel. 24Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field.”

25Nobody had sold himself to doing evil like Ahab did, influenced by his wife. 26He acted horribly in following idols like the Amorites had done that Yahveh originally drove out.

27When Ahab heard that, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and fasted. He lay down in burlap and walked around in mourning. 28Then a message came to Elijah, 29“See how Ahab has humbled himself? Since he’s done that, I won’t do what I’d promised during his lifetime. I’ll bring it on his family during his son’s life.”	 1 Kg 21:17-29

Ahab and the False Prophets

22:1Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. 2In the third year, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came down to visit the king of Israel. 3The king of Israel said to his officials, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we’re still not doing anything to take it back from the king of Aram?” 4He asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?”

Jehoshaphat said, “I’m like you, my troops like yours, my horses like yours.” 5He added, “Let’s ask first for a message from Yahveh.”

6The king of Israel gathered the prophets—about 400 men, “Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?”

“Yes, Yahveh will deliver it to you.”

7But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there still a prophet of Yahveh we can ask?”

8The king said, “There’s still one, Micaiah Ben-Imlah, but I despise him; he never prophesies anything good about me.”

9“Don’t say that.”	 1 Kg 22:1-9

10The two kings were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes at the threshing floor by the gate of Samaria. The prophets were prophesying there. 11Zedekiah Ben-Chenaanah made iron horns for himself and said, “Yahveh says you’ll gore the Arameans with these till they’re consumed.” 12The prophets were all prophesying, “Attack Ramoth-gilead. Yahveh will deliver it to you.”

Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab

13The messenger to Micaiah told him, “The prophets agree in giving a favorable report to the king. Make your report like theirs.”

14But Micaiah swore, “As sure as Yahveh lives, I’ll say what he tells me.”

15When he came, the king said, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth-gilead?”

He answered, “Go right on up there! Yahveh is going to deliver it to you!!”

16The king said, “How many times do I have to make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in Yahveh’s name?”

17He said,

“I saw Israel scattered on the mountains

like sheep without a shepherd.

Yahveh said, ‘They don’t have a master anymore;

they need to go home in peace.’”   	 1 Kg 22:10-17

18The king told Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he wouldn’t prophesy anything good about me?”

19Micaiah said,

“Listen to Yahveh’s message. I saw himY on his throne and the host in heaven standing on his left and right. 20He said, ‘Who will lure Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ One said this, another said that. 21Then a spirit came forward, ‘I’ll lure him.’

22‘How?’

‘By being a deceiving spirit in his prophets.’

‘Go do it.’”

23Micaiah said, “Yahveh has put a deceiving spirit in your prophets. He’s declared disaster for you.”	 1 Kg 22:18-23

24Zedekiah came up and hit him on the cheek, “How did Yahveh’s Spirit pass from me to speak to you?”

25“You’ll see when you’re hiding in an inner room.”

26The king said, “Take Micaiah to Amon, governor of the city, and to Joash my son. 27Tell them the king says to put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water till I come back safely.’”

28Micaiah said, “If you ‘come back safely,’ Yahveh hasn’t spoken by me. Listen to that, all of you.”

Ahab Killed in Battle

29Ahab and Jehoshaphat went up against Ramoth-gilead.

30Ahab told Jehoshaphat, “I’ll disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. 31The king of Aram had told the 32 captains of his chariots, “Don’t fight anybody great or small except the king of Israel.” 32When the captains saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they said, “That has to be the king of Israel,” and they turned aside to attack him, and he cried out. 33When they saw it wasn’t the king of Israel, they turned back. 	1 Kg 22:24-33

34An Aramean archer drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel in a joint in the armor. He told the chariot driver, “Turn around and get me out of the fight. I’m seriously wounded.” 35The battle raged that day; the king was propped up in his chariot in sight of the Arameans and died that evening. The blood from the wound ran down onto the bottom of the chariot. 36Then a shout went through the army just before sundown, “Every man to his city and country.”

37The king died; they took him to Samaria and buried him. 38They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood (where the prostitutes took baths) like Yahveh had said. 39The rest of the acts of Ahab, the ivory palace he built, the towns he built are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 40His son Ahaziah became king.   	1 Kg 22:34-40

Jehoshaphat Rules in Judah

41Jehoshaphat Ben-Asa became king in Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel. 42He was 35 and ruled for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah Bat-Shilhi. 43He followed the ways of Asa in doing what was right, but he didn’t take away the high places. People sacrificed and burned incense there. 44He also made peace with the king of Israel.

45The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the strength he showed in his rule, the wars he fought, are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 46He expelled from the land the remnant of shrine sodomites from his father’s reign. 47There wasn’t any king in Edom; a deputy served as king. 48Jehoshaphat built ships from Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn’t make it; they wrecked at Ezion-geber. 49Then Ahab’s son Ahaziah said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men go with yours in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat wouldn’t let them. 50He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Jehoram became king.	    1 Kg 22:41-50

Ahaziah Rules in Israel

51Ahaziah became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and ruled for 2 years. 52He did evil like his parents and JeroboamI that got Israel to sin. 53He served and worshiped Baal and made Yahveh God of Israel angry like his father had done.  	1 Kg 22:51-53
