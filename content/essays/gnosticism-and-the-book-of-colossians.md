When Gnostic thought tried to mix Christianity into its scheme of things, it made Jesus the ruler (ἄρχων; <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:16, 18) of one of the realms, or <em>aeons</em>, within the full <em>pleroma</em>. Another aberration was that morality ceased to be a “theological” concern since state of being rather than manner of behavior became the issue.

What Paul does in imaging the gospel in the functional equivalents of Gnosticism includes the use of <em>mystery</em> (μυστήριον). According to Paul, the real mystery was that Gentiles as Gentiles have access to fellowship with God through Jesus Christ (<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:26-27; <strong><u><sup>2</sup></u></strong>:2; <strong><u><sup>4</sup></u></strong>:3). This use of <em>mystery</em> appears also in the companion letter to the Ephesians (<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:4-6). The mystery religions, which played on the Gnostic theme (γνῶσις;<strong> 1</strong>:9-10, 27), catered to intellectual/informational exclusivism; but Christ is for all people (Ephesians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:14-16; cp. Isaiah <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>; <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>:1-3; the Book of Jonah; and Acts <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:16-18 < Amos <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:11-12).
