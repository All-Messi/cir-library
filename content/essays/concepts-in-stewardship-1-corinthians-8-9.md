CONCEPTS IN STEWARDSHIP: 1 CORINTHIANS 8-9

Most New Testament directives about giving relate to the offering Paul took up on the third missionary journey for the poor saints in Jerusalem: Romans 15:25-28; 1 Corinthians 16:1-4; 2 Corinthians 8-9; Galatians 2:10.

I. Nature of Giving

A.	Giving ourselves: 2 Corinthians 8:5

B.	Stewardship: Psalms 24:1; 1 Chronicles 29:14 (“We give you but your own.”)

II. Purpose and Use of Giving

A.	Benevolence: 2 Corinthians 8-9; Acts 6:1-6; 11:29-30; Romans 15:25-28; 1 Corinthians 16:1-4; Galatians 2:10; 1 Timothy 5:1-16

B.	Ministry: 1 Corinthians 9:6-14; 1 Timothy 5:17-18 (“honor,” cp. 5:3)

III. Manner of Giving

A.	with liberality: Romans 12:8

B.	regularly: 1 Corinthians 16:1

C.	deliberately: 1 Corinthians 16:2; Ephesians 4:28

D.	methodically: 1 Corinthians 16:2; 2 Corinthians 9:5 (by plan)

E.	cheerfully: 2 Corinthians 9:7

NOT

G.	because it is commanded: 2 Corinthians 8:8

G.	because of pressure: 2 Corinthians 8:8

H.	grudgingly: 2 Corinthians 9:7

I.	out of necessity: 2 Corinthians 9:7

IV. Motives for giving

A.	to accomplish the purpose

B.	to fulfill need: 2 Corinthians 9:12

C.	be cause you know other people will appreciate it: 2 Corinthians 12:13-15

C.	to have more to give: 2 Corinthians 9:6

C. not to get; do not misinterpret 2 Corinthians 9:6.

V. Factors that affect amount

A.	with liberality: 2 Corinthians 8:2

B.	abundantly: 2 Corinthians 8:7

C.	as a proof/expression of (the sincerity of) love: 2 Corinthians 8:8, 24

D.	according to ability: Acts 11:29; 2 Corinthians 8:3, 11-12; 1 Corinthians 16:2 (“As God has prospered you.”)

E.	that there may be equality: 2 Corinthians 8:14

F.	according to need: Acts 2:45; 4:35; 2 Corinthians 9:12

G.	in proportion to faith: Romans 12:4-8

There is no amount or portion that is commanded.

There is no amount less than all that is more sacred than the rest—no “sacred portion” as under the Law of Moses.

The principles of giving are like those associated with most other Christian graces: there is no way to quantify righteousness or legislate goodness in an interpersonal system.

“Tithing,” that is, giving a tenth, was primary element in the Old Testament taxation system. There is no place in the New Covenant where tithing is commended, commanded, or practiced as a Christian principle.

VI. Practical suggestions

A.	Doing your giving first.

B.	Keeping your giving concrete—relative to specific uses (Philippians 4:10-20).

C.	Using giving as a way of focusing your commitment and expressing love.
