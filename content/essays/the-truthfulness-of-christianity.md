THE TRUTHFULNESS OF CHRISTIANITY

The resurrection of Christ and the existence of the church stand or fall together. If he did not resurrect, the church would never have come into existence, because “Messiah abides forever.” The church exists, so Christ must have arisen. Something so obviously supernatural as his resurrection verifies the claims of Christ. The church is a person-centered system, centered on the person of Christ. If he is taken out of the way, the system collapses.
