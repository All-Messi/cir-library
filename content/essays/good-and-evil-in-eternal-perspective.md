GOOD AND EVIL IN ETERNAL PERSPECTIVE:

HELP FROM REVELATION

Good triumphs over evil.

Good and evil are not equal opposites in power or legitimacy.

Good and evil are not equally eternal. Evil has a beginning and an end.

Evil is allowed.

Evil does not simply take over and “bully” people around undeterred.

Evil is temporary (limited in length).

In comparison to good, individual evils are short-lived along the way.

Death removes it from the scene.

God intervenes when he decides to do so.

General, over-all evil is limited in the end because God overthrows it.

Evil is limited in degree.

Evil is limited, not only because it is contrary to nature and so tends to self-destruct, but because it is weaker than good and is subject to the curbing and staying hand of God.

Evil can be limited by transformation.

Evil among men is first given reason and opportunity to convert into good.

Evil is overcome first by influence before authority and force are brought to bear.

Influence is exerted by proclamation and faithfulness on the part of good.

God himself in Christ participates with us in the suffering that evil directs toward people.

There is a connection between heaven and earth.

God is aware of what is going on here.

God has a hand in history to curb and stay evil as well as to instigate and promote good.

Evil is not necessarily rectified during this life.

What happens in an individual’s lifetime is not the whole story.

What happens during history is not the whole story either.

The conquest of good over evil involves resources from outside this realm.

Humankind will not deliver itself from the grips of evil; that is where evil lies.

Things are not out of control just because they are out of our control.

Evil gets its due in two ways: along the way it usually suffers from its sins, and in the end it suffers for the sins that brought the temporal pain. Besides, evil misses out on the temporal good things of life as it unfolds, and later it misses out on the eternal good things it could have had instead.

Evil comes to a final, irreversible end.
