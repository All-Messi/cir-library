SUMMARY OBSERVATIONS ON BIBLICAL MIRACLES

I.	Types of Occurrences: divine miracle, demonic miracle, answered prayer, psychological,

magic

II.	Characteristics of Biblical Miracle

A.	Many: vs. occasional

B.	Immediate: vs. taking place over a period of hours, days, or months as perhaps in

natural healing

C.	Always successful: vs. occasional success as perhaps something merely unusual

D.	Varied: vs. just certain kinds of things that might be more easily faked or misread

1.  healing all kinds of diseases and deformities: Acts 5:16

2.  nature miracles: stilling the tempest (Matthew 8:23-27)

3.  exorcisms of demons

4.  foreknowledge (across time): Luke 22:7-13

5.  from a distance (across space): Matthew 8:5-13

6.  special miracles: by way of objects carried from the person (Acts 19:11)

7.  not dependent on the faith of the one affected: Malchus (John 18:10-11)

E.	Permanent: vs. something that “wore off” as perhaps with psychological effects

F.	Beneficial: not harmful or detrimental to the persons involved

Note, however, cases where miracles were used to curb evil and opposition.

G.	Positive: not sheer demonstration of supposed supernatural power (levitation, bending

objects, swallowing razor blades, eating fire, etc.)

sometimes without contact

H.  Secondary: vs. the center of the miracle worker’s activity

secondary to proclamation of a message

I.	Purposeful: vs. entertainment

to prove the claim of the miracle worker;

to increase faith in the one benefitted

J.	Extreme: obviously not by natural cause

blind from birth, lame from birth, resurrection, leprosy

K.	Simple: merely with a word, not an elaborate process that involved agonizing to create

the effect (as in elaborate exorcisms; Matthew 8:16; Lk. 7:7)

L.	Altruistic: free vs. done for the benefit of the miracle worker—for money, fame, etc.

Perhaps not even done on Christians: Trophimus (2 Timothy 4:20) and

Epaphroditus (Philippians. 2:25-27) (?)

M.	Public: vs. known by rumor
