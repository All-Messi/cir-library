CHURCH LEADERSHIP

I. Introduction

A. When you studies church leadership, you must adopt the principles of leadership applicable in any field. There are several fields of thought that must be studied.

l. 	Counseling

2. 	Administrative

3. 	Teaching, which applies to prospects, new Christians, and quite often the entire church, needs to include the elementary things of God’s word.

4. 	Discipline (which is also teaching and restoration):

a. 	in love (Galatians 6:l, 2)

b. 	in firmness

c. 	in scope: in doctrine and Christian living.

B. Christ as King of His Kingdom

l. 	All rule is under Him.

a. 	In the Old Testament, people are under God.

b. 	In the New Testament, they are under Christ, God’s Son (1 Corinthians

l5:24-27).

2. 	Christ established the church.

a. 	He set forth the values by which it is governed.

b.	The New Testament is our guide.

3. 	Each congregation is responsible for staying within the guidelines Christ has laid down through his apostles.

4. 	The New Testament is the sole guide in all teaching matters.

C.  Apostolic precedent: what Jesus gave the apostles and they gave the church.

l. 	Jesus taught and commissioned the apostles.

(Paul said all were bound by what Christ spoke.)

2. 	There is no liberty in departing from what Christ taught.

3. 	Liberty in human judgment takes place only where Christ and the apostles

have not spoken.

II. Church leadership breakdown

A. Services in the New Testament church

l.  Apostles (temporary)

2. Prophets (temporary)

3. Elders

4. Evangelists

5. Deacons?

B.	The New Testament qualifications and responsibilities (1 Timothy 3:1-19; Titus 1:6-9; 1 Peter 5:l-5; Acts 20:1-28, etc.).

C. 	Office or function: positions created out of need.

D. 	Work to be done

l. 	The frequent practice that elders are to preside at the communion table, offer prayers, and attend board meetings; deacons to serve the emblems, take up the offerings and attend board meetings.

2. 	There is no warrant in the Scripture for that traditional practice. They may perform these functions, of course, but Scripture gives other things as their functions.

E.  Duties and responsibilities

l. 	Elders are to lead well: teach, guide, counsel, superintend, exercise oversight,

shepherd, etc.

2. The elders are not dictators, “not lording it over the flock,” but watching and

guarding the flock.

3. 	The functions of all the leaders and teachers in the church should be understood by all the members.

III. Business affairs of the church

A. Most states have laws that require charters and bylaws. (Their purpose is to give state and federal government guidelines for tax purposes and mailing permits.)

B. 	1 Corinthians l4:40 says, “All things should be done decently and in order.”

l. 	Bylaws are an aid in proper procedure, not doctrine.

2. 	Robert’s Rules of Order help if modified to fit the needs of the church.

3. 	Go to the courthouse for requirements of your state.
