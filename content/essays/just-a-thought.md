JUST A THOUGHT

“Where Is God?”

Not only is God someone we don’t see; he is someone we can’t see (1 Timothy 3:16). We may wonder, though, why he doesn’t show himself someway at least once in a while. He could speak to us audibly or give us a vision of himself from time to time. The short answer to the question is, “We don’t know.”

On second thought, maybe it is best this way. Would we relish being reminded that he is watching our every move or knowing everything that goes through our minds? How free would we feel if God acted like a micromanager? Would we live in constant fear of failure or be always self-conscious about our inadequacies?

Maybe he is being gracious to us by keeping out of sight. Maybe he is showing confidence in us that we will do the best we can with as little prompting as possible. After all, we want to be treated like adults.
