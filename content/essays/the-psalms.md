THE PSALMS

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

BOOK 1

Psalm 1

1People are blessed that don’t

take advice from the wicked

or stand among sinners

or sit with scoffers,

2but delight in the Law of Yahveh

and meditate on it day and night.

3They’re like trees planted beside a river

that bear fruit in season,

whose leaves don’t wither.

They’re successful at what they do.

4Sinners aren’t like that:

they’re like chaff that wind blows away;

5they won’t withstand judgment

or stand among the godly.

6Yahveh watches over the godly,

but the wicked perish.		Ps 1:1-6

Psalm 2

1Why do the nations get together

to plot pointless schemes?

2Kings take their stand

and rulers hold counsel

against Yahveh and his Anointed One [Messiah]:

3“Let’s break their bonds

and throw them away.”

4The One that’s in heaven laughs;

Yahveh scoffs at them.

5He’ll speak to them in his anger

and terrify them with his fury:

6“I’ve installed my King on Zion, my holy mountain.”	Ps 2:1-6

7“I’ll tell Yahveh’s decree:

‘You’re my Son;

I’ve inaugurated you today.

8Just ask me, and I’ll give you the nations to inherit,

the most distant lands to possess.

9You’ll rule them with an iron scepter

and shatter them like clay pots.’”

10So, kings, be wise;

rulers, be warned.

11Serve Yahveh with reverence;

celebrate with trembling.

12Kiss the Son so he won’t be angry

and you perish along the way;

his anger is easily sparked.

They’re so fortunate who take refuge in him!		Ps 2:7-12

Psalm 3

A Psalm of David When He Fled from His Son Absalom

1Yahveh, I have so many enemies;

so many are working against me;

2so many are saying,

“God’s not going to help him.”		Ps 3:1-2

3But you’re my shield, Yahveh, my glory,

the One that holds my head up.

4When I call out to you,

you answer from your holy mountain.

5I lie down to sleep and wake up again

because you sustain me.

6I won’t be afraid if 10,000 oppose me.

7Arise, Yahveh; rescue me.

Slap my enemies;

knock out their teeth.

8Victory comes from you;

bless your people!		Ps 3:3-8

Psalm 4

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

with Stringed Instruments

1Righteous God, answer when I call!

Take time for me in my distress;

listen graciously to my prayer.

2People, how long will you try to ruin my reputation?

How long will you love unfounded accusations and outright lies?

3Just remember that Yahveh sets good people apart for himself;

he’ll listen when I call out to him.		Ps 4:1-3

4If you’re angry, don’t sin;

just think it to yourself in bed; don’t act it out.

5Offer sacrifices with the right attitude

and trust in Yahveh.

6Many say, “Who will show us something good?”

Smile on us, Yahveh.

7You make me happier

than those who have big crops and new wine.

8I lie down to sleep in peace

because you make me able to live safely. 		Ps 4:4-8

Psalm 5

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

with Flute Accompaniment

1Listen to me, Yahveh;

Pay attention to my groaning.

2Hear my call for help, my God and King,

because I pray only to you.

3You hear me in the mornings,

when I offer my prayers and wait.

4You’re not amused by sinfulness

because there’s nothing bad about you.

5Braggards can’t stand in your presence

because you send away everyone that sins.

6You destroy liars

and abhor bloodthirsty people.

7But I’ll go into your house under your enduring love

and bow in reverence in your holy Temple.	Ps 5:1-7

8Because I have enemies, Yahveh,

lead me in your goodness;

make your way clear to me.

9You can’t believe a word they say;

they set their heart on destruction;

their throat’s an open grave;

they flatter with their tongues.

10Hold them guilty, God;

make their own schemes trip them up!

Cast them out because of their many sins

because they’re rebelling against you.

11Let everybody be happy that takes refuge in you;

let them always sing for joy.

Defend them

so those who love you can be happy in you.

12You bless good people

and cover them with your favor like a shield.	Ps 5:8-12

Psalm 6

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

with Stringed Instruments;

Set to The Sheminith [To the Eight-String Lyre]

1Don’t lash out at me, Yahveh,

or take me to task in your anger.

2Be gracious to me because I’m weak;

heal me because I’m troubled deep inside.

3I’m really scared;

how long, Yahveh, before you save me?

4Come back and rescue me;

because of your enduring love, save me;

5because nobody talks about you when they’re dead;

who gives you gratitude in Sheol?	Ps 6:1-5

6I’m worn out from moaning;

I flood my bed with tears every night

and drench my couch with weeping.

7My eyes melt from grief,

worn out over my adversaries.

8Go away, all you sinners,

because Yahveh has heard me call.

9He’s heard my plea

and accepts my prayer.

10He’ll disgrace my enemies and greatly distress them;

they’ll suddenly retreat, humiliated.	Ps 6:6-10

Psalm 7

A Shiggaion of David that He Sang

to Yahveh About Cush a Benjamite

1Yahveh my God, I’ve taken refuge in you;

protect me from persecutors

2so they won’t tear me apart like a lion does,

and drag me away with no one to rescue me.

3Yahveh my God, if I’ve done wrong,

if there’s any injustice in me,

4if I’ve betrayed a friend

or plundered an adversary for no reason,

5chase me down and slay me;

trample me on the ground,

lay my honor in the dust.			Ps 7:1-5

6Rise up in anger, Yahveh,

against my angry enemies;

wake up and decree justice on my behalf.

7Gather the nations around you

and rule them from on high.

8You that judge all people,

judge me by my goodness and integrity.

9Put an end to people’s sinfulness;

establish goodness

because our good God tests hearts and minds.

10You’re my shield who saves the godly in heart,

11a just judge that’s angry with sinners every day.	Ps 7:6-11

12For someone that doesn’t repent,

God sharpens his sword,

bends his bow, and strings it;

13he has his deadly weapons ready

and makes arrows with flaming shafts.

14Wicked people conceive evil,

get pregnant with sin,

and give birth to lies.

15They dig a pit and hollow it out,

and fall into the hole they’ve dug to trap others.

16Their scheming comes back on them;

their violence crashes down on their own heads.

17I’ll give Yahveh the thanks his goodness calls for

and sing praise to theY Most High.	Ps 7:12-17

Psalm 8

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to The Gittith

1Yahveh, our Lord, you’re so majestic all over the world!

You display your splendor higher than the sky!

2Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies

you’ve established a defensive wall

against your adversaries,

to silence enemies that want revenge.		Ps 8:1-2

3When I look at the sky, the work of your fingers,

the moon and stars you’ve set in place,

4what are we that you give us any thought

or care about us?

5You’ve made us a little lower than the angels

and crowned us with glory and honor!

6You’ve given us responsibility over what you’ve made

and put it under our control:

7sheep and oxen, wild animals in the countryside,

8birds in the sky, fish in the sea,

whatever swims through the ocean.

9Yahveh, our Lord, you’re so majestic all over the world!

Ps 8:3-9

Psalm 9

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to the tune of “Death of the Son”

1I’ll thank you, Yahveh, with all my heart

and call attention to the amazing things you’ve done.

2I’ll gladly celebrate over you

and sing your praise, Most High.

3When my enemies retreated,

they staggered and died in front of you

4because you judged in my favor;

you sat on your throne and judged justly.

5You’ve rebuked the nations,

destroyed the wicked,

and blotted out their names forever.

6Your enemies have ended up in permanent ruins;

you’ve uprooted their towns;

the very memory of them is gone.	Ps 9:1-6

7But Yahveh reigns as king forever,

rendering judgment from his throne.

8He judges the world justly,

delivers verdicts evenhandedly,

9a stronghold for oppressed people,

a fortress in troubled times,

10trusted by those who know him

because he doesn’t abandon the ones who depend on him.

Ps 9:7-10

11Sing praises to Yahveh that lives in Zion;

tell what all he’s done.

12He that avenges murder remembers the helpless;

he doesn’t forget the cries of those who suffer.

13Be gracious to me, Yahveh;

look at how those who hate me treat me.

Lift me up from death

14so I can publicly praise you

and celebrate in Zion’s gates over your deliverance.

15The nations fall into the pit they dig

and catch their feet in the net they hide.

16Yahveh makes himself known

for carrying out judgment.

Sinners snare themselves in their own traps. 	Ps 9:11-16

[Higgaion]

17The sinful go down to Sheol;

so does every nation that forgets God.

18Needy people won’t be overlooked forever;

the hopes of the depressed won’t perish.

19Don’t let people prevail, Yahveh;

judge the nations.

20Put them in fear;

remind them that they’re mere mortals.			Ps 9:17-20

Psalm 10

1Why stand so far away, Yahveh?

Why hide when trouble comes?

2Sinners hunt down the poor in arrogance

and get themselves caught in their own schemes.

3They brag about their sinful desires;

they bless the greedy and curse Yahveh.

4In their arrogance, they don’t trust in him;

they just keep acting like there’s no God.	Ps 10:1-4

5Yet they always seem to prosper;

they don’t see your coming judgments from on high;

they sneer at adversaries

6and keep telling themselves, “We’re all set;

nothing bad is ever going to happen to us.”

7They curse, deceive, and oppress;

scheming and sin are on the tip of their tongue.

8They lie in ambush in villages,

kill innocent people in private,

and search for the unfortunate in stealth.

9They lurk in hiding places like lions in a den

and sneak around to pounce on helpless people

when they snare them in their nets.

10They crouch and slink down;

the unfortunate fall under their power.

11They tell themselves, “God won’t remember;

he doesn’t pay attention to what’s going on;

he won’t even see it.”	Ps 10:5-11

12Raise up your hand, Yahveh;

remember the helpless.

13Why do sinners renounce you?

Why tell themselves you won’t call them to account?

14You do see trouble and distress;

so you will take care of it.

Poor people commit themselves to you,

and you defend orphans.

15Break the arms of bad people;

search out sinners till there’s none left to find.

16Yahveh, you’re King forever;

nations perish at your hand.

17You listen to what the humble need

and increase your mercy toward them.

18You vindicate the orphan and the oppressed

so worldly people can’t abuse them anymore.	Ps 10:12-18

Psalm 11

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1I rely on Yahveh’s protection;

so why tell me,

“Flee like a bird to the mountains

2because the ungodly are bending the bow;

they’re putting their arrow to the string

to shoot from the shadows at the godly in heart.

3If the foundations of society collapse,

what can good people do?”

4Yahveh is in his holy Temple;

he rules from heaven,

watching everyone,

examining each one.

5He tests the good and the bad

and hates the ones that love violence.

6He’ll rain burning coals on sinners;

he’ll punish them with fire, sulfur, and scorching wind

7because he’s good and loves goodness.

Good people get to meet him face to face.		Ps 11:1-7

Psalm 12

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to The Eight-String Lyre

1Help, Yahveh; there aren’t any decent people left;

the faithful are disappearing.

2Neighbors lie to one another

and speak with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.

3May Yahveh cut off their flattering lips

and bragging tongues 4that say

“We can talk our way out of anything;

they’re our lips; who’s going to stop us?”

5Yahveh says, “Since the oppressed are suffering violence

and the needy groan,

I’ll come to give them the protection they long for.” 	Ps 12:1-5

6Your promises are pure, Yahveh,

like silver refined in a furnace seven times.

7Keep us; protect us from this generation

8that struts around, displaying its contempt. 	Ps 12:6-8

Psalm 13

1Yahveh, are you going to forget about me forever?

How long will you ignore me?

2How long must I counsel myself in constant sorrow?

How long will my enemies lord it over me?

3Think about me and respond to me, Yahveh my God;

brighten my eyes so they don’t grow dull as in death,

4so my enemies won’t brag about defeating me

and celebrate over my downfall.

5I rely on your enduring love;

I’m happy because you’ve delivered me.

6I’ll sing to you, Yahveh,

because you’ve blessed me wonderfully.		Ps 13:1-6

Psalm 14

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1Fools keep telling themselves there’s no God,

corrupt people that do corrupt things;

none of them does what’s right.

2Yahveh looks down from heaven

to see if there’s anybody that lives wisely,

if anybody seeks him.

3But they’ve all veered off course and become corrupted;

not a one of them does what’s right, not a one.

4Don’t sinners realize what they’re doing

when they eat up my people like bread

and refuse to call on me?

5Terror will overwhelm them later

because I’m taking the good people’s side.

6Oppressors try to frustrate the endeavors of the oppressed,

but I’m their refuge.

7Oh that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion!

When Yahveh restores his captive people,

Jacob will celebrate; Israel will be happy.		Ps 14:1-7

Psalm 15

A Psalm of David

1Yahveh, who can live in your Tabernacle?

Who can reside on your holy hill?

2Those who act with integrity,

who do what’s right and tell the truth;

3who don’t mistreat their neighbors

or join in gossiping about their friends;

4who despise reprobates,

but honor people that respect Yahveh,

who even swear to their own disadvantage

and carry it through,

5that don’t charge interest

or accept bribes against innocent people.

People like that will always be secure.	Ps 15:1-5

Psalm 16

A Mikhtam of David

1Protect me, Yahveh; you’re my refuge.

2I say, “You’re my Lord;

apart from you, I don’t have anything good.”

3The godly people on earth are the noble ones I delight in.

4Trouble multiplies

for those who rush off to some other god;

I won’t pour out blood offerings with them

or even say their names.

5Yahveh is my permanent possession, my cup;

he holds in safekeeping what’s allotted to me.

6The boundary lines of my inheritance fall in good places;

it’s a beautiful land.	Ps 16:1-6

7I’ll bless Yahveh that guides me;

even at night my heart teaches me.

8I keep himY continually beside me,

at my right hand so I don’t get unsettled.

9So I’m happy and celebrate;

my body will also rest secure

10because you won’t abandon me in Sheol,

or let your Holy One decay.

11You’ll show me how to live;

there’s total joy when you’re around,

with eternal delights with you.	Ps 16:7-11

Psalm 17

A Prayer of David

1Yahveh, listen to my call for justice;

pay attention to my sincere prayer.

2Declare me innocent

because you see that I’m righteous.

3You’ve visited me at night and tested my heart;

you’ve put me on trial and found nothing wrong;

I’m determined not to say anything sinful.

4Your word has kept me from following

the example of cruel people.

5My steps have stayed on your path;

my feet haven’t slipped.	Ps 17:1-5

6I’m calling on you, God,

because you answer me.

7Demonstrate your amazing, enduring love

for the ones that take refuge in you

from people that rebel against you.

8Keep me as the pupil of your eye;

hide me under your wings

9from sinners who plunder,

from deadly enemies that surround me,

10that have no mercy in their hearts,

and brag arrogantly.

11They’ve tracked me down and surrounded me,

and threaten to knock me to the ground.

12They’re like lions eager to maul me,

like young lions lurking in ambush.	Ps 17:6-12

13Confront them, Yahveh; knock them down;

deliver me from sinners with the sword

14that’s in your hand,

from people who’ve cast their lot in this life,

whose stomach you fill with your treasure.

They’re satisfied with having children

and leaving their wealth to their babies.

15But because I’m righteous,

I’ll be satisfied by seeing you when I wake up.	 Ps 17:13-15

Psalm 18 (2 Samuel 22)

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David,

Yahveh’s servant, who sang this song to him

when he delivered him from his enemies and from Saul

He said,

1“I love you, Yahveh, my strength;

2my fortress, my deliverer,

my God, my Rock, my Refuge;

my shield, the place that saves me, my stronghold.”

3I called on him who deserves praise,

and he saved me from my enemies.

4The waves of death entangled me;

the torrents of destruction flooded over me.

5the cords of Sheol tied me down;

the snares of death had entrapped me.

6In my desperation, I cried out to Yahveh,

and he heard me in his Temple.	Ps 18:1-6

7Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook

because he was angry.

8Smoke poured out of his nostrils;

consuming fire flared from his mouth;

glowing coals erupted from him.

9He lowered the sky too

and came down with dense darkness under his feet.

10He rode on a cherub

and came flying swiftly on the wings of the wind.

11He covered himself with darkness like a pavilion,

with dark rain clouds veiling his advance

12and hiding the brightness around him,

while hailstones and lightning bolts broke through his clouds.

13Yahveh thundered from the sky;

the Most High raised his voice;

hailstones and lightning bolts resounded.

14He shot his arrows and scattered my enemies;

lightning flashes routed them.

15Then the water in the ocean receded;

the seabed was exposed

at his rebuke,

at the blast from his nostrils.	Ps 18:7-15

16He reached down from on high and grabbed me

and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.

17He delivered me from enemies

that hated me,

that were too strong for me.

18They attacked me at a time of distress,

but Yahveh was my buttress.

19He brought me out to a safe place

and rescued me because he delighted in me.

20Yahveh rewarded me for my goodness,

for my innocence;

21I’d kept his ways

and hadn’t sinned by leaving him;

22his ordinances all stayed with me;

I hadn’t shoved any of his statutes away.

23I stood blameless in his presence

because I’d kept myself from sinning.

24So Yahveh rewarded me for my goodness,

for my innocence.	Ps 18:16-24

25To the kind you’re kind;

with the blameless you’re blameless;

26with the pure you’re pure;

with the treacherous you’re shrewd.

27You rescue the humble

but bring down the haughty.

28You’re my lamp, Yahveh my God,

and shine light into my darkness.

29With your help, I can crush a whole battalion

I can scale any wall.	Ps 18:25-29

30God’s way is perfect;

Yahveh’s promise proves true;

he’s a shield for everyone that depends on his protection.

31Who is God except Yahveh?

Who is a rock but our God,

32who wraps me in strength

and makes my way safe?

33He makes my feet as surefooted a red deer’s hooves

and stands me securely on high ground.

34He trains my hands for battle

and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow.

35He’s given me his deliverance as a shield;

his help has made me great.

36He’s widened the path where I step

so my feet don’t slip.	Ps 18:30-36

37I chased my enemies and overtook them;

I didn’t turn back till I’d eliminated them.

38I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again;

they fell under my feet

39because you wrapped me in strength for battle

and subdued my assailants.

40You’ve made my enemies retreat;

I destroyed the ones that hated me.

41They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any;

they even cried out to Yahveh, but he didn’t answer.

42I pulverized them like dust in the wind,

emptied them out like dirt on the street.

43You delivered me from conflict with the people

and placed me at the head of nations;

people I didn’t know now serve me.

44Foreigners submit as soon as they hear me;

45they lose heart and come cringing out of their fortresses.

Ps 18:37-45

46Yahveh lives; praise be to my Rock;

exalted be God that delivers me,

47that avenges me,

that subdues nations under me.

48that rescues me from my enemies,

lifts me above my attackers,

and delivers me from violent people.

49So I’ll thank you among the nations, Yahveh,

and sing your praises.

50You give victory for your king

and show enduring love to your anointed one,

to me [David] and my descendants forever.		Ps 18:46-50

Psalm 19

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David.

1The heavens show God’s glory;

the sky displays his workmanship.

2Day in and day out they speak;

night after night they display intelligence.

3There’s no speech or words;

there’s nothing to hear.

4Their testimony goes out to the whole world,

their message to the ends of the earth;

in them he’s pitched a tent for the sun.

5It’s like a groom coming out of his room,

excited like a man in shape to run a race.

6It rises at one side of the sky

and makes its circuit to the other;

nothing escapes its warmth.		Ps 19:1-6

7The Law of Yahveh is perfect for reviving the soul;

his Testimony is reliable for making simple people wise.

8The precepts of Yahveh are right, bringing happiness;

his commandments are clear, enlightening the mind.

9Respect for Yahveh is pure, lasting forever;

his judgments are true and altogether just.

10They’re worth more than lots of fine gold;

they’re sweeter than honey that drips from the honeycomb.

11They warn me

and reward me when I keep them.

12Who can see their own mistakes?

So declare me innocent of my unseen faults.

13Restrain me from presumptuous sins;

don’t let them gain control of me.

Then I’ll be blameless and relieved for not sinning.

14May what I think and say

be acceptable to you, Yahveh, my Rock, my Redeemer.	Ps 19:7-14

Psalm 20

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1When trouble comes, may Yahveh answer you!

May Jacob’s God set you safely on high!

2May he send help from the sanctuary

and support you from Zion!

3May he remember your many meal offerings

and find your burnt offerings acceptable.

4May he grant you your heart’s desire

and make your plans successful.

5You’ll sing for joy over his deliverance

and hoist your banners in his name.

May Yahveh give you your petitions.		Ps 20:1-5

6We know Yahveh saves his anointed ones;

he answers them from his holy heaven

with the saving strength of his right hand.

7Some nations boast about chariots and horses,

but we’ll boast about Yahveh our God.

8Those nations will collapse and fall,

but we’ll rise up and stand tall.

9Give us victory, Yahveh, when we call.	Ps 20:6-9

Psalm 21

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1Yahveh, the king delights in your strength;

he’s happy because you’ve helped him.

2You’ve given him his heart’s desire;

you didn’t withhold his request.

3You met him with blessings

and crowned him with fine gold.

4He asked you for life,

and you gave him life everlasting.

5He has great honor because you delivered him

and endowed him with splendor and majesty.

6You make him blessed forever

and happy because you’re with him.		Ps 21:1-6

7The king trusts in Yahveh;

because of the enduring love of the Most High,

he won’t be deposed.

8You’ll discover all your enemies;

you’ll find out who hates you.

9You’ll throw them into a blazing furnace in your anger;

you’ll burn them up in your wrath

10and destroy their offspring.

11Though they’ve devised a coup to harm you,

they won’t succeed.

12You’ll put them to flight

when you snap your bowstring at their faces.

13Be honored in your strength, Yahveh;

we’ll sing praises about your power.		Ps 21:7-13

Psalm 22

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to The Hind of the Dawn

1My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

Why are you so far from helping me,

so far from my groaning?

2I call out in the daytime, but you don’t answer;

I don’t get any relief at night.

3Yet you’re holy,

enthroned on Israel’s praises.

4Our ancestors trusted in you, and you delivered them.

5They called out to you, and you saved them;

they relied on you, and you didn’t disappoint them. 	Ps 22:1-5

6But I’m a worm, not a man;

people scorn me and despise me.

7Everybody that sees me makes fun of me;

they make faces at me and shake their heads at me and say,

8“Entrust yourself to Yahveh; let him deliver you;

let him rescue you because he delights in you!”

9Yet you’re the One that delivered me from the womb

and made me trust when I was on my mother’s breasts.

10I’ve depended on you from birth;

you’ve been my God from my mother’s womb.	 	Ps 22:6-10

11Don’t be distant because trouble’s near;

there’s nobody else to help me.

12Many bulls have surrounded me;

fierce bulls from Bashan have gathered around me.

13They bellow at me

like ravening, roaring lions.

14I’m being poured out like water;

all my bones are out of joint;

my heart’s melting like wax.

15My strength has dried up like a potsherd,

my tongue is sticking to my jaws,

and you’ve laid me down dead in the dust.

16Dogs have surrounded me;

an crowd has ganged up on me;

they’ve pierced my hands and feet.

17I can count all my bones;

people are staring at me;

18they’re dividing up my clothes

and gambling for my garments.		Ps 22:11-18

19Don’t be distant, Yahveh;

you’re my only help; hurry and help me.

20Deliver me from the sword;

rescue me from the dog’s paws;

21save me from the lion’s mouth

and the wild ox’s horns.	Ps 22:19-21

22I’ll tell my brothers about you

and praise you when your people gather.

23You that respect Yahveh, praise him;

stand in awe of him, descendants of Israel,

24because he hasn’t looked down on the oppressed

or ignored them;

when they’ve appealed to him for help, he’s listened. 	Ps 22:22-24

25The theme of my praise in the great assembly comes from you;

I’ll fulfill my vows in front of people that respect you.

26The poverty-stricken will eat and be satisfied;

those who rely on Yahveh will praise him.

May their hearts live forever!	Ps 22:25-26

27The most distant places will remember and turn to Yahveh;

all the families in the nations will worship him

28because the kingdom belongs to him;

he rules the nations.

29Prosperous people will eat and worship;

everyone that goes down to dust will bow to him,

all those who can’t keep themselves alive.

30Posterity will serve him;

one generation will tell the next one about him.

31To people not yet born,

they’ll come to declare his goodness,

that he’s the One that’s done all of this.	Ps 22:27-31

Psalm 23

A Psalm of David

1Yahveh is my shepherd;

I’ll have everything I need.

2He beds me down in green pasture

and leads me beside still water.

3He refreshes me

and guides me along good paths for his honor.

4Even though I walk through the darkest valley,

I won’t be afraid, because he’s with me;

his rod and staff reassure me.

5You set a table for me in front of my enemies;

you anoint my head with oil;

my cup runs over.

6Goodness and mercy will follow me all my life,

and I’ll live in Yahveh’s house forever.	Ps 23:1-6

Psalm 24

A Psalm of David

1The earth and everything in it belongs to Yahveh,

the world and those who live here.

2He positioned land higher than seas,

more elevated than ocean currents.

3Who can climb his mountain

and stand in his holy place?

4People with clean hands and pure hearts,

who don’t offer themselves up to idols

or lie under oath.

5They’ll receive a blessing from Yahveh,

goodness from the God who keeps them safe.

6That’s the way it is for those who seek him out

and worship him—even the House of Jacob.	Ps 24:1-6

7Open up, gates;

open up, everlasting doors,

so the glorious King can enter!

8Who is the glorious King?

Yahveh strong and powerful,

Yahveh mighty in battle.

9Ope up, gates;

Open up, everlasting doors,

so the glorious King can enter!

10Who is the glorious King?

Yahveh of Hosts,

he is the glorious King.	Ps 24:7-10

Psalm 25

A Psalm of David

1I hold my life up to you, Yahveh;

2I trust you;

don’t let me down

or let my enemies celebrate over my defeat.

3Nobody that waits for you will be discredited;

people who deal treacherously

are the ones that will be discredited.	Ps 25:1-3

4Yahveh, let me know your ways;

teach me your paths;

5lead me in your truth

because you keep me safe;

I’ll always depend on you.

6Remember your mercy and enduring love

that have existed from ages past.

7Don’t keep in mind the sins I committed when I was young;

remember me in the light of your enduring love.	Ps 25:4-7

8Yahveh is good and just,

so he instructs sinners in his way

9and leads the humble in what’s right.

10Everything he does comes from truth and enduring love

for those who keep his covenant and testimonies.

11For your own honor,

pardon my sin because it’s great. 	Ps 25:8-11

12Who of you respect Yahveh?

He’ll instruct you in what to choose

13so you’ll keep succeeding

and your offspring will inherit the land.

14People that respect Yahveh are his friends;

he’ll make his covenant known to them.

15I keep looking to him

because he untangles my feet from my enemies’ net.	Ps 25:12-15

16Turn to me and be gracious

because I’m lonely and downcast.

17Relieve me of my pain and anguish,

and lift me out of my doldrums.

18Look at my troubles

and forgive my sin.	Ps 25:16-18

19Look at all the enemies I have

that hate me so much!

20Guard my life and rescue me;

don’t let me regret taking refuge in you.

21Oh that integrity and godliness would protect me

because I depend on you.

22Redeem Israel, God, from all its troubles.	Ps 25:19-22

Psalm 26

A Psalm of David

1Declare me innocent, Yahveh,

because I’ve conducted myself with integrity

and trusted in you without wavering.

2Examine me, put me on trial,

test my motives and attitude.

3I keep my eye on your unfailing love

and follow you faithfully.

4I don’t sit with deceitful people

or run around with pretenders.

5I detest the company of unreliable people

and refuse to join in with sinners.

6I’ll wash my hands to express my innocence

and frequent your altar, Yahveh,

7singing my gratitude

and telling about the wonderful things you’ve done.	Ps 26:1-7

8Yahveh, I love the Temple where you live,

the place where your glory lies.

9Don’t carry off my soul with sinners,

or my life with bloodthirsty people

10that devise sinful schemes

and hand out bribes left and right.

11But I maintain my integrity;

redeem me with your grace.

12My foot stands on solid ground;

I’ll bless you publicly. 	Ps 26:8-12

Psalm 27

A Psalm of David

1Yahveh is my light and salvation;

who am I going to be afraid of?

He defends me;

who am I going to dread?

2When bad people come to devour me,

they stumble and fall.

3Though an army attacks me, it won’t frighten me;

though war breaks out against me, I’ll stay confident.	Ps 27:1-3

4I ask Yahveh for one thing—what I look for most:

to live in his house my whole life,

to see his beauty and meditate in his Temple.

5When trouble comes, he’ll shelter me;

he’ll hide me in a secret place

and station me on a high rock.

6I’ll hold up my head above my enemies;

in his Tabernacle I’ll offer sacrifices with shouts of joy

and sing praises to Yahveh.	Ps 27:4-6

7Listen when I call out, Yahveh;

be gracious and answer me.

8You said, “Seek me,”

my heart and soul responded, “I’ll seek you.”

9Don’t ignore me

or turn away angry.

You’ve been my help;

don’t abandon me, God my Savior.

10Even if my parents exposed me I as an infant to die,

you would pick me up.	Ps 27:7-10

11Teach me your way, Yahveh;

lead me on a level path away from my enemies.

12Don’t turn me over to them,

because lying witnesses have taken the stand against me,

the kind that threatens violence with every breath.

13I’d have despaired if I hadn’t believed

I’d see Yahveh’s goodness while I was alive.

14So wait for him;

be strong and courageous.

Yes, wait for him.	Ps 27:11-14

Psalm 28

A Psalm of David

1I’m calling out to you, Yahveh;

don’t turn a deaf ear, my Rock;

otherwise, I’ll be like someone going down to the Pit.

2Help me when I plead for help,

when I lift up my hands toward your holy sanctuary.

3Don’t drag me away with the wicked,

with those who sin,

who offer their neighbors peace

while selfish motives lurk in their hearts.

4Pay them back according to their deeds,

in proportion to the sin they practice.

5Since they don’t appreciate

what you’ve made and done,

tear them down and don’t rebuild them.	Ps 28:1-5

6Bless Yahveh for listening to my petition.

7He’s my strength and shield;

I trust him and he helps me;

so I celebrate and thank him with songs.

8He’s his people’s strength,

the saving defense for his anointed ones.

9Save your people and bless your inheritance;

be their shepherd and carry them forever.	Ps 28:6-9

Psalm 29

A Psalm of David

1Children of the mighty,

attribute to Yahveh honor and strength.

2Honor him like he deserves;

worship him in his holy splendor.	Ps 29:1-2

3The sound from Yahveh carries out over the water;

our glorious God thunders across the ocean expanse.

4His voice is loud and majestic

5and blows down cedars in Lebanon.

6He makes Lebanon skip like a calf

and Sirion [Mt. Hermon] jump around like a young wild ox.

7The sound from Yahveh flashes out lightning bolts

8and shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh;

9it makes deer go into labor

and strips the trees bare.

In his Temple everyone shouts, “Glory!”

10Yahveh sits like a king above the flood,

enthroned forever.

11He gives his people courage

and blesses them with peace.	Ps 29:3-11

Psalm 30

A Psalm of David

A Song at the Dedication of the Temple

1I’ll praise you, Yahveh, because you’ve rescued me;

you haven’t let my enemies celebrate victory over me.

2I appealed to you for help, my God,

and you restored my health;

3you brought me up from Sheol;

you kept me from going down to the Pit.

4Sing praise to Yahveh, his holy people;

thank him 5because his anger is only for a little while,

but his blessing lasts a lifetime.

Weeping may go on all night,

but rejoicing comes in the morning.	Ps 30:1-5

6In my good fortune, I said, “I’ll never be shaken.”

7Your blessing, Yahveh, made me feel as stable as a mountain;

but then you hid from me, and I was shattered.

8I called out to you in a petition:

9“What does my death accomplish if you let me go down to the Pit?

Will dust praise you and tell about your faithfulness?

10“Hear me, Yahveh; be gracious and help me.”

11You turned my mourning into dancing;

you removed my burlap of mourning

and dressed me in happiness.

12Now I can sing praise to you unrestrained;

I can be eternally grateful to you.	Ps 30:6-12

Psalm 31

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1I take refuge in you, Yahveh;

never let me be disgraced;

in your goodness protect me.

2Listen to me, rescue me quickly;

be a rock for me,

a strong fortress to save me.

3You’re my rock and fortress;

for your honor, lead me and guide me.

4Free me out of the trap people secretly laid for me

because you’re my protection.

5I’m entrusting my spirit to you;

rescue me, Yahveh, true God. 	Ps 31:1-5

6I detest those who respect worthless idols;

I trust in you, Yahveh.

7I’ll be happy in your enduring love,

because you see my difficulties

and know the trouble I’m in,

8because you haven’t handed me over to my enemies;

you’ve set me on a spacious place.	Ps 31:6-8

9Be gracious to me in my distress, Yahveh;

my eyes are melting away with grief,

my soul and body are getting weak as well

10because I live in constant sorrow;

I spend my years in sighing.

My strength is failing because of sin;

my body is wasting away.

11Because I have so many enemies,

my neighbors despise me,

my acquaintances abhor me,

and people shun me in the streets.

12I’m forgotten like someone long dead,

out of mind like a broken pot.

13I hear people’s slander;

there’s terror on every side;

my enemies conspire against me

and lay plots to kill me.	Ps 31:9-13

14But I trust you, Yahveh;

I swear, “You’re my God.”

15My future’s in your hands;

rescue me from my enemies,

from those who persecute me.

16Smile at me;

save me with your enduring love.

17Don’t let my enemies disgrace me, Yahveh,

because I’m calling on you.

Put sinners to disgrace;

let them be silent in Sheol.

18Make lying lips be mute

that insult the good with pride and contempt.	Ps 31:14-18

19How great your goodness is

that you’ve stored up for those who respect you,

that you’ve shown to people that take refuge in you

so others can see.

20You secretly hide them with you away from people’s plots,

and shelter them from the conflict that tongues can cause.

21Bless Yahveh

because he showed me his enduring love

when I was surrounded like a city under siege.

22I despaired in my alarm, “I can’t see you!”

but you heard my appeal.	Ps 31:19-22

23Love Yahveh, all you holy people!

He preserves the faithful

and repays those who act arrogantly.

24Be strong and courageous,

you that rest your hopes in him!	Ps 31:23-24

Psalm 32

A Maskil. A Psalm of David

1How blessed they are whose sin God forgives,

whose transgression he covers;

2whose disobedience Yahveh doesn’t hold against them,

whose spirit doesn’t harbor deceit!

3When I didn’t acknowledge my sin,

my body wasted away,

I moaned all day,

4your hand weighed on me day and night,

my strength drained away in the summer heat.

5When I acknowledged it and said, “I’ll confess my sin to Yahveh,”

you forgave me.

6So everyone that’s godly needs to pray to you

while there’s time;

so when distress floods in,

it won’t overwhelm them.

7You’re our hiding place

for protecting us from trouble

and surrounding us with songs about deliverance.	Ps 32:1-7

8I’ll teach you the way to go;

I’ll focus my attention on you and advise you.

9Don’t be like a senseless horse or mule

that needs a bit and bridle to make it obey.

10Sinful people incur lots of sorrow,

but enduring love surrounds those who trust Yahveh.

11Be happy and celebrate in him;

shout for joy, all of you with godly hearts.	Ps 32:8-11

Psalm 33

1Sing for joy to Yahveh, good people;

praise is fitting for the godly.

2Give himY thanks with a lyre;

sing praises to him with a ten-string harp.

3Sing a new song to him;

play skillfully and shout for joy.

4You can believe what heY says

and rely on what he does.

5He loves goodness and justice,

and fills the world with his enduring love.	Ps 33:1-5

6Yahveh made the sky with a word,

all its host with the breath from his mouth.

7He gathered the water in the ocean

and stored up the depths in reservoirs.

8The whole world must respect him

and stand in awe of him.

9He spoke and it happened;

he commanded and it occurred.

10Yahveh overrides the counsel of nations

and frustrates the peoples’ plans.

11His counsel stands forever;

his plans endure across the generations.	Ps 33:6-11

12The nation is blessed whose God is Yahveh,

the people he’s chosen for his inheritance.

13Yahveh looks down from heaven at everyone;

14from where he sits, he sees the whole human race.

15He made their hearts;

so he understands what they do.

16A king doesn’t prevail by his large army;

a soldier doesn’t save himself by his great strength.

17A warhorse gives false hope for victory;

it doesn’t deliver anyone by its power.	Ps 33:12-17

18Yahveh watches over those who respect him,

who place their hope in his enduring love

19to deliver them from death

and keep them alive at famine time.

20We wait for him, our help and shield,

21and celebrate in him because we trust in him.

22Send down your enduring love to us, Yahveh,

because we’ve put our hope in you.	Ps 33:18-22

Psalm 34

A Psalm of David When He Faked Insanity

Before Abimelech, Who Drove Him Away

1I’ll bless Yahveh at all times

and praise him constantly.

2I’ll make my boast about him;

the helpless will hear it and take heart.

3Let’s tell how great Yahveh is;

let’s honor him together.

4I looked to Yahveh; he answered me

and freed me from my fears.

5People that look to him are radiant;

they never look subdued.

6I cried out in my suffering, and heY listened

and saved me from my troubles.

7An angel of Yahveh camps around people that respect him,

and he rescues them.	Ps 34:1-7

8Taste and find out how good Yahveh is,

how blessed everyone is that takes refuge in him!

9Respect him, his holy people;

those who do, have everything they need.

10Young lions get hungry,

but anyone that looks to Yahveh has everything good.

11Come, children, listen to me;

I’ll teach you to respect Yahveh.

12Who wants to live

a long time and prosper?

13Keep your tongue from sinning

and your lips from lying.

14Quit doing bad and do good;

look for peace and pursue it.	Ps 34:8-14

15Yahveh watches over good people

and hears them cry out to him.

16He turns against those who practice sin,

and erases the memory of them.

17When good people call for help; he listens

and rescues them from their troubles.

18He’s close to the brokenhearted

and saves those whose spirit is crushed.

19Good people face lots of trouble,

but Yahveh delivers them.

20They keep all their bones;

not a one of them will be broken.

21Sin slays the sinful;

God punishes those who hate the righteous.

22He redeems his servants;

he doesn’t condemn anyone that takes refuge in him.	Ps 34:15-22

Psalm 35

A Psalm of David

1Yahveh, oppose the ones that oppose me;

fight those who fight me.

2Put on buckler and shield,

and come to my aid.

3Draw spear and javelin against my pursuers;

tell me you’ll save me.

4Dishonor the ones that want to kill me;

drive back and humiliate those who scheme against me.

5Make them like chaff in the wind,

with the angel of Yahveh blowing them.

6Make their path dark and slippery,

with the angel of Yahveh chasing them;

7for no reason they hid a net to catch me

and dug a pit to trap me.

8Bring destruction on them unawares;

have the net they hide catch them;

have them fall into that very destruction.	Ps 35:1-8

9I’ll be happy in Yahveh

and celebrate over his salvation.

10My very bones say, “Yahveh who is like you

that delivers the oppressed from people too strong for them,

and saves the needy from the one that robs them?”

11Malicious witnesses testify against me

and accuse me of things I don’t do.

12They repay me bad for good; I’m heartbroken.

13But when they were sick, I wore burlap;

I humbled myself with fasting

and prayed with my chin on my chest.

14I went about as if it was my friend or brother;

I bent over mourning as if it was my mother.

15But when I stumbled, they celebrated and ganged up on me;

strikers that I didn’t even know gathered against me

and slandered me for no reason.

16Like godless jesters at a feast,

they gnashed their teeth at me.	Ps 35:9-16

17Lord, how long will you just watch?

Rescue me from their ravages;

save me from those lions.

18I’ll thank you in the great community

and praise you in the mighty throng.

19Don’t let my enemies celebrate over me,

or wink maliciously who hate me.

20They don’t talk about peace;

they scheme against those who are peaceful in the land.

21They open their mouth wide against me,

“Aha, aha, we saw him do it!”	Ps 35:17-21

22You can see what they’re doing, Yahveh;

don’t stand back and not say anything.

23Stir yourself up, awake for my justice,

for my cause, my Lord and my God.

24Judge me, Yahveh, according to your goodness;

don’t let my enemies celebrate over me.

25Don’t let them say to themselves, “Just what we’d hoped!”

don’t let them say, “We’ll eat him alive!”

26Humiliate them who celebrate over my distress;

dress them in shame and dishonor

who vaunt themselves up over me.	Ps 35:22-26

27Shout for joy you that are in favor of my vindication;

say again and again, “Yahveh is great;

he delights in his servant’s prosperity.”

28I’ll declare your goodness and praise all day long.	Ps 35:27-28

Psalm 36

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of David, Yahveh’s Servant

1Sin speaks to sinful people’s hearts;

they don’t respect God at all.

2They flatter themselves

that he can’t discover their sin.

3Their words deceive;

they’ve stopped being wise and doing good.

4They devise schemes in bed

and carry them out in the morning with no qualms	Ps 36:1-4

5Yahveh, your enduring love reaches the stars;

your faithfulness is as high as the sky;

6your goodness as mighty as the mountains;

your justice as deep as the ocean;

your provision sufficient for everything that breathes.

7How precious that enduring love is!

All humanity finds protection under your wings.

8They drink their fill from the abundance in your house,

from your river of delights.

9You’re their fountain of life;

in your light they see light.

10Maintain your enduring love to all who know you,

your goodness to the godly in heart. 	Ps 36:5-10

11Don’t let the proud tramp on me

or the sinful shove me away.

12Let sinners fall where they sin,

thrown down so they can’t get up.	Ps 36:10-12

Psalm 37

A Psalm of David

1Don’t worry about bad people

or envy those who do wrong;

2they’ll wither like grass

and fade like flowers.

3Trust in Yahveh and do good

so you can live in the land and enjoy security.

4Delight in Yahveh,

and he’ll give you what your heart desires.

5Commit your way to him and trust in him,

and he’ll act on your behalf.

6He’ll bring forth your goodness like the dawn

and your vindication like the midday sun.	Ps 37:1-6

7Rest in Yahveh and wait patiently for him;

don’t worry about people that prosper

by carrying out dishonest schemes.

8Stop being mad at them; set anger aside;

don’t concern yourself with them;

that only leads to your own sinning.

9They’ll be destroyed,

but those who depend on Yahveh will inherit the land.

10Sinners will soon be gone;

you can look all over for them,

but they won’t be there.

11It’s the humble will inherit the land

and delight in abundant prosperity.	Ps 37:7-11

12The wicked plot against the good

and gnash their teeth at them.

13But Yahveh laughs at them,

because he sees what’s going to happen to them.

14Sinners draw the sword and bend the bow

to bring down the poor and needy,

and slay the godly;

15but their sword will pierce their own heart,

and their bow will break.	Ps 37:12-15

16The little that good people have is better

than the abundance sinners possess;

17because Yahveh will break the arms of sinners

and sustain the good.

18He knows the time of the blameless;

their inheritance lasts forever.

19They aren’t discouraged in hard times

and have plenty during famine.

20But the sinful perish;

Yahveh’s enemies are like flowers in a pasture;

they dissipate like smoke.

21The wicked borrow and don’t repay,

but the good are generous and give.

22Those he blesses will inherit the land;

the ones he curses will die.	Ps 37:16-22

23Yahveh guides the steps of the godly

and delights in their lives.

24If they fall, they won’t fall headlong

because Yahveh will hold their hand.

25I was young once; now I’m old;

yet I’ve not seen good people abandoned

or their children beg for bread.

26They’re gracious and generous;

their descendants are a blessing.

27Quit doing bad things and do good,

so you’ll live forever.	Ps 37:23-27

28Yahveh loves justice

and doesn’t abandon his holy people;

he keeps them forever,

but cuts off the descendants of the wicked.

29The godly will inherit the land

and live there permanently.

30The godly utter wisdom and speak justice.

31The Law of their God is in their heart;

their feet don’t slip.

32Sinners spy on them

and try to kill them.

33Yahveh won’t abandon the godly to their power

or let them be condemned when they’re judged.

34Wait for Yahveh and keep his way,

and he’ll raise you up to inherit the land;

you’ll see the wicked destroyed. 	Ps 37:28-34

35I’ve seen a violent, wicked people spread themselves out

like tall trees in their native soil.

36Then they passed away and were gone;

I looked for them, but they were nowhere to be found.

37Take note of blameless, watch the godly

because peaceful people prosper;

38but sinners will be destroyed

along with their future.

39The salvation of the godly comes from Yahveh,

their refuge when trouble comes.

40Yahveh helps them and delivers them,

protects them from sinners and saves them

because they take refuge in him. 	Ps 37:35-40

Psalm 38

A Psalm of David

for a Memorial

1Yahveh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath

or discipline me in your furious anger.

2Your arrows have pierced deep into me;

your hand has come down hard on me.

3Because of your indignation, my body’s not sound;

by my sin I’ve ruined my health.

4My iniquities have piled up higher than my head

and weighed me down.

5My wounds have festered and grown foul.

My foolish choices 6have doubled me over;

I grieve all the time;

7I’m burning up with fever;

my health is broken.

8I’m numb and crushed,

and groan from inner conflict.	Ps 38:1-8

9Yahveh, you know what I long for;

you hear my sighs.

10My heart’s pounding, my strength’s failing;

the sparkle in my eyes is gone.

11My friends and loved ones stand back from my sickness;

my relatives stay well away from me.

12Those who want to kill me lay snares for me;

the ones that want to injure me threaten destruction,

constantly plotting treachery.	Ps 38:9-12

13But like someone deaf, I don’t hear;

like a mute I don’t speak.

14Yes, I’m like somebody that can’t hear,

someone with no arguments to offer.

15I’m depending on you, Yahveh;

you’ll have to answer for me:

16Don’t let them celebrate over me

or gloat when my foot slips.

17I’m ready to fall;

my sorrow continually looms in front of me.

18I’m confessing my iniquity;

I’m anxious about my sin.

19But my enemies are vigorous and strong;

they hate me for no reason.

20and repay bad for good

because I follow after what’s good.

21Don’t leave me, Yahveh;

stay close by!

22Hurry and help me, Lord my savior!	Ps 38:13-22

Psalm 39

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to Jeduthun

1I said, “I’ll watch what I do

so I won’t sin with my tongue;

I’ll put a muzzle on my mouth

while sinful people come around.”

2But when I kept silent even about what was good,

it was of no avail;

my agitation grew worse.

3The more I thought about it

the more the fire burned within me;

so I spoke up:

4“Yahveh, show me my end,

how long I’ll live;

let me realize how fleeting my life is.

5You’ve made my days like handbreadths;

my lifetime is only a moment to you.

We all stand like a mere breath.

6We walk around like shadows in turmoil for nothing;

we accumulate wealth without knowing who will inherit it.

Ps 39:1-6

7“Now Lord, what is it I’m waiting for?

You’re my only hope.

8Save me from my sins;

don’t let fools humiliate me.

9I can’t open my mouth; I’m unable to speak

because you’re the one that disabled me.

10Stop striking me;

I’m exhausted from your blows.

11You discipline us for our sins

and consume like a moth what’s precious to us.

Clearly, we’re all nothing more than a breath.	Ps 39:7-11

12“Hear my prayer, Yahveh;

don’t ignore my tears

because I’m a passing guest,

a nomad like my ancestors.

13Leave me alone so I can be happy again

before I’m gone and don’t exist anymore.”	Ps 39:12-13

Psalm 40

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1I waited patiently for Yahveh;

he listened to my call for help.

2He brought me up out of the pit of despair,

out of the muddy clay,

set my feet on solid rock,

and made my footsteps secure.

3He put a new song in me, a song about praising God;

other people will hear it, see what he’s done, and trust in himY.

4How blessed people are that trust in Yahveh

instead of turning to proud or deceitful people.

5Yahveh my God, you’ve done so many amazing things;

your good intentions for us are too many to tell.

Nobody compares with you.

If I tried to tell about your wonderful acts,

I couldn’t recount them all.	Ps 40:1-5

6You don’t delight in sacrifices and meal offerings;

you haven’t required burnt offerings and sin offerings;

you’ve pierced my ears. [you gave me a bodyLXX.]

7Then I said, “I’m coming;

it’s written about me in the scroll;

8I delight in doing your will, my God;

I have your Law at heart.”

9In the great assembly

I’ve proclaimed the good news about goodness;

I didn’t hold back

10or keep to myself the truth about your goodness;

I spoke openly about your saving power,

about your enduring love and truth.	Ps 40:6-10

11Yahveh, don’t withhold your mercy from me;

let your enduring love and truth keep protecting me.

12Troubles beyond number surround me;

my own sins overtake me

till I can’t see any way to escape them.

13Yahveh, please hurry and help me.

14Embarrass and humiliate those who keep trying to destroy me;

disgrace the ones that delight in hurting me.

15Make them appalled at their disgrace

who say to me, “Aha, aha!”

16Make them happy who look to you,

who love your salvation and chant,

“Yahveh is great.”

17Keep me in your thoughts

because I’m in misery and need you,

my helper, my deliverer.

Don’t delay.			Ps 40:11-17

Psalm 41

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1How blessed people are that have regard for the poor;

Yahveh will deliver them when they have need.

2He’llY protect them, keep them alive, and call them blessed;

3sustainY them when they’re sick and restore them to health.

Ps 41:1-3

4I said, “Be gracious to me, Yahveh;

heal my soul because I’ve sinned against you.”

5My enemies say rude things about me:

“When’s he going to die

so we can forget about him?”

6When they come to visit me,

they say things they don’t mean;

they just come to gather threads

they can weave into gossip when they leave.

7Everybody that hates me whispers behind my back

and makes up hurtful things to say about me:

8“He has some deadly disease;

he’ll never get out of bed again.”

9Even the close friend that I trusted, that I ate with,

has turned against me.	Ps 41:4-9

10But you, Yahveh, be gracious and restore me

so I can pay them back.

11I know you’re pleased with me;

you haven’t let my enemies triumph over me.

12You’ve upheld me in my integrity

and brought me into your eternal presence.

13Bless Yahveh God of Israel

from everlasting to everlasting.

Amen and Amen.	Ps 41:10-13

BOOK 2

Psalm 42

For the Choir Director

A Maskil of the Sons of Korah

1My soul pants for God

like a deer pants for water.

2My soul is thirsty for the living God;

when will I ever see him?

3My tears have been my food day and night

as people ask me all the time, “Where’s your God?”

4I think about these things as I pour out my soul.

I used to go with the throng,

leading the procession to the house of God,

singing for joy and giving thanks

in the great celebration.

5Why despair, my soul?

Why be disturbed?

Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him

for the help his presence brings.

6I’m in despair, God;

so I remember you from the land of the Jordan,

from the peaks of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.

7The sounds of your crashing waves echo back and forth;

your waves and breakers are sweeping over me.	Ps 42:1-7

8Yahveh directs his enduring love to me in the daytime;

I sing his songs at night, prayers to my living God.

9I say to God, my Rock, “Why have you forgotten me?

Why do I go around mourning

because my enemies oppress me?”

10Like breaking my bones, they taunt me;

people ask me all the time, “Where’s your God?”

11Why despair, my soul?

Why be disturbed?

Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him

for the help his presence brings.	Ps 42:8-11

Psalm 43

1Declare me innocent, God;

defend me against this ungodly nation;

deliver me from liars!

2You’re the God that I rely on for courage;

why reject me?

Why do I go around mourning

because my enemies oppress me?

3Send your light and truth to lead me,

to bring me to the holy hill where you live.	Ps 43:1-3

4Then I can go to your altar, my greatest source of joy,

and praise you with a harp.

5Why despair, my soul?

Why be disturbed?

Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him,

my helper and my God.	Ps 43:4-5

Psalm 44

For the Choir Director

A Maskil of the Sons of Korah

1God, our ancestors have told us

what you did in their time long ago.

2You drove out nations and planted this one;

you struck them and scattered them abroad.

3Our ancestors didn’t conquer the land with their sword;

their own arm didn’t save them.

Your right hand, your arm,

the light of your presence did it

when you showed them favor.	Ps 44:1-3

4You’re my King, God;

ordain victories for Jacob in our day too.

5By your power we’ll push back our adversaries

and tramp down our attackers.

6We don’t trust in our bow;

our sword won’t save us.

7You are the one that must save us from our enemies

and disgrace those who hate us.

8We take pride in you always

and give you thanks forever.	Ps 44:4-8

9Yet now you’ve set us aside to dishonor;

you don’t go out with our armies.

10You’ve made us retreat from our enemies;

those who hate us have plundered our land.

11You’ve butchered us like sheep

and scattered us among the nations.

12You sell us cheap

and make no profit from doing it.

13You make us a disgrace to our neighbors,

something to scoff at,

14a byword the world over,

a laughingstock among the nations.	Ps 44:9-14

15All day long we’re disgraced and humiliated

16because people insult us;

we have enemies and avengers everywhere.

17That’s all come on us though we haven’t forgotten you

or been unfaithful to your covenant.

18Our heart hasn’t deserted you;

we haven’t strayed from your way;

19yet you’ve crushed us in a place filled with jackals

and covered us with the shadow of death.	Ps 44:15-19

20If we’d forgotten you

or raised our hands to a foreign god,

21wouldn’t you have found it out?

You know all our inner secrets.

22But for the sake of your honor, our lives are always in danger;

we’re like sheep headed for slaughter.

23Wake up, Yahveh; why are you sleeping?

don’t reject us forever.

24Why ignore us

and forget our suffering and oppression?

25We’re struck down to the dirt;

our bodies stick to the ground.

26Get up and help us;

redeem us like your enduring love suggests. 	Ps 44:20-26

Psalm 45

For the Choir Director. Set to Lilies

A Maskil of the Sons of Korah. A Song About Love

1My heart is overflowing with a noble theme

as I recite my verses to the King;

my tongue is like the pen of a gifted poet.

2You’re more handsome than the sons of men;

gracious words stream from on your lips;

God has blessed you forever.

3Strap your sword to your thigh, Mighty Warrior,

in your splendor and majesty!

4 In your majesty, ride on to victory,

defending truth, humility, and goodness;

have your right hand display awesome deeds.

5Your sharp arrows pierce your enemies’ hearts;

nations fall under you.	Ps 45:1-5

6Your throne is eternal, God;

your kingdom’s scepter is a godly one.

7You love goodness and hate sinfulness;

so God, your God, has anointed you

with more happiness than your companions.

8Your robes have the fragrance of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;

stringed instruments entertain you in ivory palaces.

9Yourmas maids of honor include kings’ daughters;

at yourmas right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir. Ps 45:6-9

10Listen, daughter; pay attention;

forget your people and your father’s family

11The king delights in your beauty;

since he’s your lord, bow to him.

12The people from Tyre will shower youfem with gifts;

wealthy citizens will sue yourfem favor.

13The princess looks beautiful

in her gown interwoven with gold.

14She’ll be led to the king in embroidered robes

with bridesmaids in her train.

15With happiness and celebration,

they’ll enter the palace of the king.	Ps 45:10-15

16Yourmas sons will take the place of yourmas fathers;

you’llmas make them rulers over many lands.

17I’ll perpetuate yourmas memory in every generation;

the nations will be eternally grateful to youmas.	Ps 45:16-17

Psalm 46

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

Set to Alamoth. A Song

1God is our refuge and strength,

an ever-present help when trouble comes.

2So we won’t be afraid

though the ground tremors,

though the mountains cascade into the sea,

3though its water roars and foams,

though the land quakes at its tsunamis.

4There’s a river of joy that flows into the city of God,

the sacred place where the Most High lives.

5God is there; it’s unmovable;

from the break of day, he protects it.

6When nations rage and kingdoms totter,

his voice thunders and earth melts away.

7Yahveh of Hosts is with us;

the God of Jacob is our refuge.	Ps 46:1-7

8Come and look at what Yahveh does:

he brings destruction on the earth;

9he stops wars all over the world;

he breaks bows and snaps spears in two;

he burns chariots.

10“So be still and know that I’m God,

exalted in every nation,

honored all over the world.”

11Yahveh of hosts is with us;

the God of Jacob is our refuge.	Ps 46:8-11

Psalm 47

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1Clap your hands, everybody;

shout to God with joy;

2because you are to revere Yahveh Most High,

the great King over the whole world.

3He subdued people groups under us,

put nations beneath our feet,

4and chose our inheritance for us,

the pride of Jacob that he loves.	Ps 47:1-4

5God has ascended with a shout,

with a trumpet fanfare.

6Sing praises to God, sing praises;

sing praises to our King, sing praises;

7because God is King over the whole world;

sing praises with a beautiful psalm.

8He reigns over the nations on his holy throne.

9The rulers of the people have gathered together

with the people of Abraham’s God;

because the shields of the earth belong to him;

he’s highly honored.	Ps 47:5-9

Psalm 48

A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1Yahveh is great and deserves great praise

in the city of our God on his holy mountain.

2Mount Zion, the heights of Zaphon, is high and beautiful—

the joy of the whole earth, the city of the great King.

3In its towers God reveals himself as a strong defense.

4Kings joined forces

and advanced against that strong defense.

5But as soon as it came into view,

they panicked and fled.

6Panic seized them

like the anguish of a woman in childbirth.

7Yahveh destroyed them

like ships of Tarshish capsized by an east wind.

8As we’ve heard, so we’ve seen

in the city of Yahveh of Hosts, our God;

he’ll make it safe forever.	Ps 48:1-8

9In your Temple we think about your enduring love.

10Like your name, God, your praise is everywhere;

your right hand is filled with goodness.

11Let Mount Zion be happy,

and the residents of Judah celebrate your goodness.

12Walk around Zion and count its towers;

13inspect its ramparts and tour its fortresses

so you can tell the next generation;

14because God is God forever;

he’ll guide us till we die.	Ps 48:9-14

Psalm 49

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1Hear this, every nation;

listen, everyone on earth,

2low and high, rich and poor alike.

3My words are wise;

my thoughts are full of insight.

4I listen to proverbs

and expound my riddles on a harp.

5Why should I be afraid when there’s adversity,

when my enemies’ sins are all around me,

6people who trust in their wealth

and brag about how rich they are?

7Nobody can use wealth to redeem a brother from death

or pay God a ransom for him—

8redeeming a life is too expensive;

you may as well forget about

9living on forever and not seeing the Pit.	Ps 49:1-9

10Even the wise die—

just like the ignorant and senseless—

and leave their wealth to others.

11They act like their houses will last forever,

like where they live will be there for all generations;

so they name their lands after themselves.

12But in all their pomp, they won’t endure;

they’ll perish like animals.

13This is the fate of the foolish

and those who agree with them:

14like sheep they’re appointed to Sheol;

death will be their shepherd.

The godly will rule them in the morning;

Sheol will consume their form

far from their stately homes.

15But God will redeem me from its power

and take me to himself.	Ps 49:10-15

16Don’t be afraid when people get rich,

when their houses appreciate in value;

17because when they die, they won’t take anything with them;

what they gloried in won’t go down with them to the grave.

18Though they congratulate themselves while they’re alive,

though other people praise them for being successful,

19they’ll go to their ancestors

and never see the light of day.

20People in all their pomp who don’t have intelligence

amount to being like animals when they die.	Ps 49:16-20

Psalm 50

A Psalm of Asaph

1The Mighty One, God, Yahveh, has spoken

and calls to earth from sunrise to sunset.

2He shines forth out of Zion in perfect beauty.

3Our God comes; he doesn’t stay quiet;

a fire consumes in front of him;

a storm rages around him.

4He calls on the sky above and the earth beneath

to witness the judgment of his people.

5“Gather my people to me

that I’ve made a covenant with by sacrifice.”

6The heavens declare his justice

because God himself is judge.	Ps 50:1-6

7“Listen, my people, and I’ll speak;

Israel, I’ll bring my charges against you.

I’m God, your God.

8I don’t have any complaint about your sacrifices

or burnt offerings that are always in front of me.

9But I don’t need any bulls from your barns

or male goats from your pens;

10every animal in the forest already belongs to me,

the livestock on a thousand hills.

11I know every bird in the mountains;

everything that moves in the field is mine.

12If I was hungry, I wouldn’t say anything to you about it,

because the whole world belongs to me and everything in it.

13Will I eat the meat of bulls

or drink the blood of male goats?

14Offer to me a sacrifice of thanksgiving;

keep your vows to the Most High.

15Call on me when there’s trouble;

then I’ll rescue you, and you’ll honor me.”	Ps 50:7-15

16But God says to the sinful,

“What reason do you have to recite my statutes

or discuss my covenant?

17You hate discipline

and disregard what I tell you.

18Thieves are your friends;

you associate with adulterers.

19You give your mouth free reign;

your tongue tells lies.

20You sit around and gossip about your brother;

you slander your mother’s son.

21I didn’t speak up when you did those things,

so you thought it didn’t matter to me;

but now I’ll charge you

and lay out my case against you. 	Ps 50:16-21

22“Consider this, you that forget about me,

or I’ll tear you to pieces,

and there won’t be anyone to save you.

23Giving thanks is the sacrifice that honors me;

I’ll show you my deliverance if you keep to my path.” 	Ps 50:22-23

Psalm 51

Psalm for the Choir Director. A Psalm of David,

When Nathan the Prophet Came to Him,

After He’d Slept with Bathsheba

1Be gracious to me, God, in proportion to your enduring love;

according to your great mercy, blot out my transgressions.

2Wash me thoroughly from my sin;

cleanse me from my iniquity.

3I know my failings;

my sin always weighs on my mind.

4I’ve sinned against you and you only;

I did what you consider evil;

so you’re justified in what you say to me,

blameless when you condemn me.	Ps 51:1-4

5I was born in sin;

in iniquity my mother conceived me.

6You want truth in the inward self;

you’ll make me know wisdom in myself.

7Purify me with hyssop, and I’ll be clean;

wash me, and I’ll be whiter than snow.

8Fill me with joy and happiness again,

and let the bones you broke mend up.

9Don’t look at my sins;

blot out my iniquities.	Ps 51:5-9

10Create a clean heart in me, God;

renew a steadfast spirit within me.

11Don’t banish me from your presence

or take your Holy Spirit away from me.

12Restore to me the joy your salvation brings;

grant me a willing attitude to obey.

13Then I’ll teach transgressors your ways;

sinners will be converted to you.

14Deliver me from being guilty of murder

so I can joyfully sing about your goodness.

15Yahveh, open my lips,

so I can express your praises.

16You don’t delight in sacrifice; otherwise, I’d give it;

you’re not pleased with burnt offerings.

17The sacrifice you want is a broken spirit;

you appreciate a repentant heart.

18In your good favor, do good to Zion;

build up the walls around Jerusalem.

19Then you’ll delight in godly sacrifices,

in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;

then young bulls will again be offered on your altar.	Ps 51:10-19

Psalm 52

For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David,

When Doeg the Edomite Came and Told Saul,

“David has gone to Ahimelech’s house.”

1God’s enduring love lasts all day;

so why brag about sinning, great soldier?

2Your tongue cuts like a razor.

3You like evil more than good,

falsehood more than truth.

4You like words that devour

and a lying tongue that deceives.

5But God will strike you down once and for all;

he’ll pull you out of your tent

and uproot you from the land of the living. 	Ps 52:1-5

6Good people will see it and be amazed;

they’ll laugh at you and say,

7“Look at the men that wouldn’t take refuge in God,

but trusted in their great wealth

and used their strength to destroy.”

8But I’m like a green olive tree in God’s house;

I’ll always trust in his enduring love.

9I’ll be eternally grateful for what he’s done,

and depend on him in front of his holy people

because that’s good.	Ps 52:6-9

Psalm 53

For the Choir Director. Set to Mahalath

A Maskil of David

1Fools tell themselves there’s no God.

They’re corrupt and commit disgusting sins;

none of them does what’s good.

2God looks down from heaven

to see if anybody understands,

if anybody looks to him.

3Every one of them has turned aside and become corrupt;

not a one does what’s good, not a one.	Ps 53:1-3

4Won’t sinners ever learn?

They eat up my people like bread

and don’t pray to me.

5They’ll be in a panic like never before,

because I’ll scatter the bones of your attackers;

you’ll put them to shame because I’ve rejected them.

6Oh that deliverance would come out of Zion!

When I restore the fortunes of my people,

Jacob will celebrate, Israel will be happy.	Ps 53:4-6

Psalm 54

For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David,

When the Ziphites Came and Told Saul,

“Isn’t David hiding among us?”

On Stringed Instruments

1Deliver me, God, by your name;

vindicate me by your power.

2Listen to my prayer; hear what I have to say.

3Foreigners have attacked me;

violent people have tried to kill me;

they don’t care about you.

4But God helps me; Yahveh sustains my life.

5He pays back my adversaries

and destroys them in his faithfulness.

6I’ll sacrifice to him willingly

and thank him because he’s good.

7He’s delivered me from all my trouble

so I could triumph over my enemies.	Ps 54:1-7

Psalm 55

For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David

On Stringed Instruments

1Hear my prayer, God;

don’t ignore my plea.

2Listen and answer;

trouble has overwhelmed me; I’m distracted

3by the threats of my enemies,

by bringing suffering on me

and bearing angry grudges against me.	Ps 55:1-3

4My heart’s pounding;

terror of death has fallen on me.

5Fear and trembling have come over me;

horror has overwhelmed me.

6I said, “I wish I had wings like a dove!

I’d fly off and find peace.

7I’d flee far away

and lodge out in the countryside.

8I’d hurry to my shelter

from the howling wind and raging storm.”	Ps 55:4-8

9Lord, destroy their plans; confuse their languages,

because all I see is violence and conflict in the city.

10Day and night they patrol the walls,

but sin and scheming threaten inside it.

11Ruin is rampant within it;

oppression and cheating never leave the streets.	Ps 55:9-11

12It’s not an enemy that’s disparaging me;

I could handle that;

it’s not foes that hate me and rise up against me,

I could hide from them.

13But it’s you, my equal,

my companion, my familiar friend.

14We used to be close friends

that walked in God’s Temple together.

15Let death overtake my enemies;

let them go down alive to Sheol,

because there’s evil where they live.	Ps 55:12-15

16I’ll call on Yahveh my God to deliver me.

17Morning, noon, and night, he’ll hear my groaning

18and deliver my life in peace from my attackers,

because lots of people are opposing me.

19The One who sits enthroned from of old

will punish the ones that don’t change or respect him.

20As for that companion of mine,

he betrays his friends and breaks his promises

against those who are at peace with him.	 Ps 55:16-20

21His speech is smoother than butter,

but there’s war in his heart;

his words are more soothing than oil,

but secretly they’re drawn daggers.

22Put your burdens on Yahveh, and he’ll take care of you;

he won’t let the godly fall.

23You, God, will bring the wicked down to the deepest pit;

bloodthirsty, devious people won’t live half their time,

but I’ll trust in you.           	 Ps 55:21-23

Psalm 56

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

When the Philistines Seized Him in Gath

Set to The Pigeon in Far-Off Terebinths

1Be gracious, God; people are walking all over me,

oppressing me all the time, 2attacking me.

3When I’m afraid, I put my trust in you.

4In you, whose word I praise, I’ve put my trust;

what can mortals do to me?

5All day long they try to frustrate my purposes;

they think up ways to harm me.

6They stir up conflict, they lurk, they watch my every step,

looking for a chance to kill me.

7Because they’re sinful, throw them out;

in anger put them down, God!	Ps 56:1-7

8You’ve kept track of my wanderings

and collected my tears in your bottle;

aren’t they recorded in your scroll?

9My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help;

I know this one thing: you’re with me.

10In God, whose word I praise,

in Yahveh, whose word I praise,

11I’ve put my trust so I won’t be afraid;

what can mortals do to me?

12I have to perform my vows to you;

I’ll give thank offerings for your help,

13because you’ve delivered me from death

and my feet from stumbling

so I can walk with you in the light of life.	Ps 56:8-13

Psalm 57

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

When He Fled from Saul in the Cave

Set to Do Not Destroy

1Be gracious to me, God,

because I depend on you to protect me;

in the shadow of your wings I take refuge

till danger passes.

2I call out to God Most High,

who accomplishes everything for me;

3he sends help from heaven to rescue me

and discredits whoever tries to run over me. 	Ps 57:1-3

4I live among lions;

I have to lie among those who breathe fire,

people whose teeth are spears and arrows,

whose tongues are sharp swords.

5Be raised up higher than the sky, God;

shine your glory on the whole world.

6They’ve set a trap for me to step in;

they’ve dug a pit for me—I’m weary from stress—

but they’ve fallen into it themselves!	Ps 57:4-6

7My heart is steadfast, God; it’s steadfast;

I’ll sing; yes, I’ll sing praises!

8Wake up, my glory;

wake up, harp and lyre;

I’ll wake up the dawn with my songs.

9I’ll give you thanks, God, among the peoples

and sing praises to you among the nations.

10Your enduring love is as high as the sky;

your truth reaches up to the clouds.

11Be raised up higher than the sky, God;

shine your glory on the whole world.	Ps 57:7-11

Psalm 58

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David

1Leaders, do you decree what’s right?

Do you judge justly?

2No, you plot injustice in your hearts

and spread violence in the land.

3The sinful go astray from the womb;

they lie from the time they’re born.

4They have venom like vipers,

and stop up their ears like deaf cobras

5so they don’t hear their charmers’ voices

or those skilled at casting spells.	Ps 58:1-5

6Pull out their fangs, God;

break the teeth out of the young lions.

7Make them disappear like water that drains away;

make their arrows shafts without points.

8Make sinners be like snails that dissolve as they go along,

like a miscarriage that never sees the sun.

9Before your pots can feel the heat of burning briers;

he’ll sweep them away with a whirlwind,

whether green or on fire.	Ps 58:6-9

10Good people will celebrate when they see God pay them back;

he’ll wash their feet in the sinners’ blood.

11People will say, “There’s surely a reward for good people;

there’s certainly a God that judges on earth!”	Ps 58:10-11

Psalm 59

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

When Saul Sent Men to Watch the House and Kill Him

Set to Do Not Destroy

1Deliver me from my enemies, God;

set me on high away from my attackers.

2Save me from sinners;

rescue me from bloodthirsty people.

3They lie in ambush to kill me;

fierce enemies stir up conflict against me, Yahveh,

but not for my transgression.

4For no fault of mine, they run to attack me;

get up to see and help me!		Ps 59:1-4

5Yahveh God of Hosts, God of Israel,

wake up and punish the nations;

don’t extend grace to any that are treacherous.

6They come back in the evening

and roam the city, howling like dogs.

7They growl with their mouth;

they have swords in their lips;

they say, “Who’s going to hear us?”

8But you laugh at them, Yahveh;

you scoff at the nations.	Ps 59:5-8

9I’ll watch for you, my Strength, my fortress.

10You’ll meet me in your enduring love;

and let me look down in triumph at my enemies.

11Don’t kill them; otherwise, my people will forget;

scatter them with your power

and bring them to their knees, Yahveh our shield.

12For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips,

catch them in their pride, their curses, and the lies they tell.

13In your anger, destroy them so they’ll be out of the way,

so people will know that you rule in Jacob

and everywhere.

14They come back in the evening

and roam the city, howling like dogs.

15They wander around looking for food

and growl if they’re not satisfied.	Ps 59:9-15

16But I’ll sing about your strength,

every morning about your enduring love.

You’ve been my fortress,

my refuge in trouble.

17I’ll sing praise to you, my Strength,

the God who shows me enduring love.	Ps 59:16-17

Psalm 60

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

to teach when he struggled with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah,

and Joab came back and struck 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt

1You’ve rejected us, God, and broken us;

you’ve been angry, but restore us now.

2You’ve made the land quake; you’ve split it open;

now repair the faults and stop the tremors.

3You’ve made your people endure hardship

and given us wine that makes us stagger.

4You’ve raised a banner for those who respect you

as a rallying point for truth.

5Save us now with your right hand and answer us,

deliver your beloved.	Ps 60:1-5

6In his kindness God has answered;

“I’ll celebrate by dividing up Shechem

and measuring out the Valley of Succoth.

7Gilead and Manasseh belong to me;

Ephraim is my helmet; Jacob is my scepter.

8Moab will be my washbasin;

I’ll scrape off my shoes on Edom

and shout in triumph over Philistia!”	Ps 60:6-8

9Who will take me to a fortified city?

Who will lead me to Edom?

10Have you rejected us, God?

You’re not going out with our armies.

11Help us against our enemies;

we have no hope of human deliverance!

12Through you we can do valiantly;

you’ll tread down our adversaries.	Ps 60:9-12

Psalm 61

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

On Stringed Instruments

1Listen to my prayer, God; hear my prayer.

2With a faint heart I call to you from the end of the earth;

lead me to the rock that’s higher than me.

3You’re my refuge, my strong tower against the enemy.

4Let me live in your tent forever

and take shelter under your wings.

5You’ve heard my vows, God,

and given me the inheritance that comes to those who respect you.

6Lengthen the king’s life;

make his lifetime like many generations.

7Have him sit enthroned in your presence forever;

appoint enduring love and truth to preserve him.

8I’ll sing praise to you forever

as I pay my vows each day.	Ps 61:1-8

Psalm 62

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to Jeduthun

1I wait for God alone

because my victory comes from him.

2He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress;

I won’t be shaken.

3How long will youpl assail me

so you can murder me,

like a leaning wall or crumbling fence?

4Your only intention is to knock me down;

you enjoy lying about me;

you bless out loud but curse inside.	Ps 62:1-4

5My soul, wait in silence for God

because my hope lies only in him.

6He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress;

I won’t be shaken.

7My deliverance and glory rest with him,

my strong rock and refuge.

8Always trust him, people;

pour out your heart to him, our refuge.	Ps 62:5-8

9Common people have no value;

the powerful aren’t what they seem.

Either one rises higher in the balances;

they’re both lighter than air.

10Don’t put confidence in extortion;

don’t place empty hopes in stealing.

If wealth does increase, don’t set your heart on it.

11God has spoken once;

I’ve heard it twice

that power belongs to God

12and Yahveh has enduring love;

he pays people according to their work.	Ps 62:9-12

Psalm 63

A Psalm of David,

When He Was in the Wilderness of Judah

1God, you’re my God; I look to you in earnest;

my soul thirsts for you;

my flesh yearns for you in this dry, weary land.

2So I’ve looked at you in the sanctuary

and seen your power and glory.

3 I’ll praise you

because your enduring love is better than life;

4I’ll bless you as long as I live

and lift up my hands in your name.

5You satisfy my soul like the finest food;

I offer praises gladly.	Ps 63:1-5

6I remember you when I’m in bed;

I think about you during the night.

7You’ve been my help;

I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.

8My soul clings to you;

your right hand upholds me.

9But those who are trying to destroy me

will end up in the ground.

10The sword will overwhelm them;

they’ll become prey for foxes.

11But the king will celebrate in God;

everybody that swears by him will glory

while liars’ mouths will be stopped.	Ps 63:6-11

Psalm 64

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1Listen to my complaint, God;

keep me from living in dread of my enemies.

2Hide me from the secret plots of bad people,

from the schemes of sinners

3that sharpen their tongue like a sword,

that aim bitter words like arrows,

4that shoot at innocent people from hiding places,

and do it suddenly without qualms.

5They latch onto sinful purposes

and talk secretly about setting traps;

they say, “Who will notice?”

6They look for ways to be unjust,

“We’re ready with a well-conceived plot,”

because the human mind and heart are cunning.	Ps 64:1-6

7But God will wound them with an arrow

8and make them trip over their tongues!

Everybody that sees them will shake their heads.

9Then everybody will be respectful

and talk about what God’s done

and ponder what he’s made.

10Good people will be happy in Yahveh

and take refuge in him;

the godly in heart will honor him.	Ps 64:7-10

Psalm 65

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

A Song

1There will be silence in your presence, God,

as well as praise in Zion;

people will fulfill their vows to you.

2All people will come to you, who hear prayers.

3Sins overwhelm us, but you forgive them.

4How blessed are the ones you choose

and bring close to you to live in your courts;

how satisfying is the goodness of your house,

the holy Temple.	Ps 65:1-4

5You answer us with awesome deeds, God who keeps us safe,

who is trusted in every land and the farthest sea.

6You established the mountains by your power

and dressed yourself with strength,

7you that still the roaring seas

and the disturbances among the nations.

8They who live at the ends of the earth

stand in awe at your wonders;

you make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.	Ps 65:5-8

9You take care of the earth and water it;

you greatly enrich the ground and provide the water

to grow the grain;

that’s how you’ve ordained things to work.

10You water the plowed ground abundantly and level its ridges;

you soften its clods with showers and bless its growth.

11You crown the year with abundant harvests;

paths get overgrown with lush vegetation.

12The pastures in the countryside drip with dew;

the hills blossom with rejoicing.

13The meadows are clothed with flocks;

the valleys are covered with grain;

they shout and sing for joy.	Ps 65:9-13

Psalm 66

For the Choir Director. A Psalm. A Song

1Make a joyful sound to God, all the earth.

2Sing about his honor;

make his praise glorious.

3Say to him, “What you do is so awesome!

Your enemies feign obedience to you

out of fear for your power.

4All the earth worships you and praises you;

they sing praises to you.”	Ps 66:1-4

5Come and see what God has done;

it’s awesome what he’s done for people.

6He turned the Red Sea into dry ground;

the people crossed through the Jordan on foot;

they celebrated over him there.

7He rules by his power forever;

he keeps watch over the nations;

the rebellious don’t make an uprising.	Ps 66:5-7

8Bless our God, you nations;

sound his praise abroad.

9He keeps us alive

and doesn’t let our feet slip.

10You’ve tried us, God,

and refined us like silver.

11You caught us in your net

and laid a heavy load in our lap.

12You put a ruler over us

and passed us through fire and water;

yet you brought us out into a large place.

13I’ll come to your Temple with burnt offerings

and keep the vows 14I made when I was in trouble.

15I’ll offer you burnt offerings of healthy animals

with the smoke of rams;

I’ll offer bulls and male goats.	Ps 66:8-15

16Come and listen, you that respect God,

and I’ll tell you what he’s done for me.

17I appealed to him with my mouth

and extolled him with my tongue.

18If I cherish sinfulness in my heart,

Yahveh won’t hear me.

19But he’s certainly heard me;

he’s listened to my prayer.

20Bless God,

who hasn’t ignored my prayer

or withdrawn his enduring love.	Ps 66:16-20

Psalm 67

For the Choir Director. A Psalm. A Song

With Stringed Instruments

1God, be gracious and bless us;

smile at us

2so every nation can know your way

and your saving power.

3May the nations praise you;

may they all praise you.

4May they be happy and sing

because you judge them justly

and guide them.

5May the nations praise you, God;

may they all praise you.

6The earth has yielded its produce;

God, our God, has blessed us

7so everyone everywhere will respect him.	Ps 67:1-7

Psalm 68

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

A Song

1Arise, God, scatter your enemies;

chase off those who hate you!

2Blow them away like smoke;

melt them like wax near fire;

make sinners perish in your presence.

3But may good people be happy,

delight in your presence,

celebrate and be glad.

4So sing to God, sing praises to him;

lay out a highway for the One that rides through deserts,

whose name is Yahveh,

and celebrate with him.	Ps 68:1-4

5God in his holy Temple

is a father for the fatherless and a judge for widows;

6he makes a home for the lonely

and leads prisoners out to prosperity;

only the rebellious live in a parched land.

7God of Israel, when you went out ahead of your people

and marched through the desert,

8the ground shook,

the sky poured down rain,

Sinai itself quaked in front of you.

9You sent widespread, abundant rain, God,

and refreshed your inheritance when it was parched.

10The animals settled in it;

in your goodness you provided for the poor.	Ps 68:5-10

11The Lord gives the command,

and a host of women sing the good news:

12“Kings and their armies flee

the women that stayed home divide the spoil!”

13Even those who stayed among the flocks found treasure

like the wings of a dove covered with silver

and pinions covered with glistening gold.

14The Almighty scattered the enemy kings there

like blowing snow in Zalmon.

15The mountain in Bashan is majestic,

a mountain range with many peaks.

16Mountain with many peaks, why do you look with envy

at the mountain God wanted for his home?

He’ll certainly live there forever.

17God had twice ten thousand chariots, thousands upon thousands;

Yahveh came with them from Sinai to the holy place.

18When you ascended on high and led captivityLXX captive,

and received gifts from people, even rebellious people—

so Yahveh God might live there.	 Ps 68:11-18

15The mountain in Bashan is majestic,

a mountain range with many peaks.

16Mountain with many peaks, why do you look with envy

at the mountain that God wanted for his home?

He’ll certainly live there forever.

17God had twice ten thousand chariots, thousands upon thousands;

Yahveh came with them from Sinai to the holy place.

18He has ascended on high and led captivityLXX captive,

and received gifts among people,

even among the rebellious so Yahveh God might live there.

Ps 68:15-18

19Bless Yahveh, who carries our burdens every day,

who keeps us safe 20and rescues us;

deliverance from death comes from Yahveh the Lord.

21He’ll bash in the heads of his enemies,

the hairy crowns of those who keep doing their guilty deeds.

22The Lord said, “I’ll bring them down from Bashan

and bring them up from the ocean depths

23so you can wash your feet in their blood

and your dogs can have their share of your enemies.”	Ps 68:19-23

24They’ve seen your solemn procession, God,

the procession of God, my King, into the sanctuary—

25singers first, then musicians,

with young women playing tambourines.

26Bless God as a community,

Yahveh, the fountain of Israel.

27There’s Benjamin, the youngest, leading them,

the officials of Judah in the throng,

the officials of Zebulun and Naphtali.

28Summon your strength, God;

show us your power like you have before.

29Kings will bring you gifts

because of your Temple in Jerusalem.

30Scare off the beast that lives in the reeds,

the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations.

Trample underfoot its bars of silver;

scatter the nations that delight in war.

31Let envoys bring gifts out of Egypt;

let Nubia quickly submit to God.	Ps 68:24-31

32Sing to God, kingdoms on earth;

sing praises to Yahveh,

33that rides high in the ancient sky,

that thunders out his loud voice.

34Attribute power to God,

whose majesty shines on Israel,

whose strength is displayed in the sky.

35He’s awesome in his sanctuary;

the God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.

Bless God!	Ps 68:32-35

Psalm 69

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to Lilies

1Save me, God;

I’m in water up to my neck!

2I’ve sunk in deep mud, where there’s no foothold;

a flood is sweeping over me.

3I’m worn out from crying; my throat’s dry;

my eyes are red from crying, waiting for my God.

4The people that hate me for no reason

outnumber the hairs on my head;

those who want to destroy me are powerful;

they’re trying to make me repay what I didn’t steal.	Ps 69:1-4

5God, you know about my foolish choices;

I can’t hide the things I’ve done wrong.

6May those who put their hope in you

not be disgraced because of me;

may the ones who look to you

not be dishonored by what I’ve done;

7because I’ve endured humiliation for your sake;

I have shame written all over my face.

8I’m alienated from my brothers;

my mother’s sons treat me like a foreigner.

9I’m consumed with zeal for your Temple;

the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.

10When I humble myself with fasting, they mock me;

11when I wear burlap, they make my name a byword.

12Those who sit in the city gate talk about me;

drunks make up songs about me.	Ps 69:5-12

13But, I pray to you, Yahveh;

at an acceptable time, in your great enduring love,

answer me with your sure salvation.

14Save me from sinking in the mud;

deliver me from my enemies and from deep water.

15May the flood not overwhelm me

or the deep drown me

or the Pit close over me.	Ps 69:13-15

16Answer me, Yahveh, because your enduring love is good;

turn to me according to your great mercy.

17Don’t abandon me,

because I’m in distress; answer me quickly.

18Come close to my soul and redeem it;

ransom me from my enemies.

19You know my disgrace, shame, and dishonor;

all my adversaries stand in your presence.	Ps 69:16-19

20Insults have broken my heart; I’m heartsick.

I looked for sympathy, but there wasn’t any,

and for comforters, but I couldn’t find any.

21Instead, they gave me gall to eat and vinegar to drink.

22May their table become a snare

and their peace a trap.

23May their eyes go blind

and their loins tremble feebly.

24Pour out indignation on them;

overwhelm them with furious anger.

25Make their camp desolate

and their tents deserted.

26They persecute the one you yourself have struck;

they strike even more the ones you’ve already wounded.

27Pile their sins high;

don’t let them experience your goodness.

28Erase them from the Book of Life;

don’t enroll them with the godly.	Ps 69:20-28

29I’m miserable with pain;

save me, God; set me safely up high.

30I’ll praise God with song

and magnify him with thanksgiving.

31That will please Yahveh more

than a young bull with horns and hoofs.

32The humble will see it and be happy;

you that look to God for help will revive your hearts.

33Yahveh listens to the needy;

he doesn’t look down on his imprisoned people.	Ps 69:29-33

34Let earth and sky praise him,

the seas and everything that’s in them.

35God will save Zion and rebuild the towns in Judah

so the people can settle there and own it.

36The descendants of his servants will inherit it;

those who love him will live there.	Ps 69:34-36

Psalm 70

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

for a Memorial

1Hurry and deliver me, Yahveh;

come quick to help me.

2Discredit those who want to kill me;

turn them back and

dishonor the people that delight in harming me.

3Because of their disgrace,

turn them back those who say, “Aha, Aha.”

4May the ones that depend on you be happy in you;

may those who love your deliverance repeatedly say,

“God is great.”

5But I’m poor and needy, Yahveh!

you’re my deliverer; don’t delay.	Ps 70:1-5

Psalm 71

1I’ve taken refuge in you, Yahveh;

don’t let me be discredited.

2In your goodness, rescue me;

listen to me and save me.

3Be my rock of refuge that I can always go to;

give orders to save me

because you’re my rock and fortress.

4Rescue me from sinners,

from the grasp of cruel men.

5You’re my hope, Lord Yahveh,

my confidence since I was young.

6the One that took me from my mother’s womb

and sustained me since I was born.	Ps 71:1-6

7Many have marveled over me

because you’ve been my strong refuge.

8I’m full of your praise

and glory all the time.

9Don’t set me aside in my old age

or leave me as my strength begins to fail.

10My enemies speak against me;

they who want to kill me consult with each other,

11“God has left him.

Let’s go get him;

he doesn’t have anybody to defend him.”	Ps 71:7-11

12God, stay close by to help me.

13Consume my adversaries with shame;

cover their faces with dishonor that try to harm me.

14But I’ll keep hoping

and praising you on and on.

15I’ll tell about your goodness

and how many times you’ve saved me,

though I can’t count how often that’s happened.

16I’ll praise the great deeds of the Lord Yahveh

and tell about the goodness you alone have.	Ps 71:12-16

17You’ve been teaching me since I was young;

I still talk about your wonderful deeds.

18Even when I’m old and grey, don’t leave me, Yahveh,

till I tell this generation about your strength

and future people about your power.

19Your goodness is as high as the sky,

you that have done great things.

Who is like you?

20You let me face troubles and distresses,

but you revive me afterwards

and lift me out of deep despair.

21You increase your greatness toward me

and comfort me once again.

22I’ll praise you with a harp for your faithfulness, my God;

and sing praises with a lyre, you Holy One of Israel.

23I’ll shout for joy when I sing to you;

my soul that you’ve redeemed will praise you.

24I’ll talk about your goodness,

because the ones that were trying to harm me

have been discredited.	Ps 71:17-24

Psalm 72

A Psalm of Solomon

1Give the king your judgments, God;

give your goodness to his son.

2May he judge your people fairly,

your oppressed ones with justice.

3Let the mountains bring prosperity to the people;

may the hills bring goodness.

4May he defend the downtrodden,

save the children of the needy,

and crush their oppressors.	Ps 72:1-4

5Let them respect you as long as the sun lasts,

as long as the moon endures—throughout all generations.

6May the king rule like rain on mown grass,

like showers that water the ground.

7May good people flourish in his time

and have abundant peace till the moon disappears.	Ps 72:5-7

8May he rule from sea to sea,

from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.

9Let desert nomads bow to him,

and his enemies lick dust.

10Let the kings of Tarshish and the islands bring presents,

and the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.

11Let all kings bow to him

and every nation serve him.

12He’ll deliver the needy when they call for help,

the oppressed with no one to help them.

13He’ll have mercy on the poor and needy

and save their lives.

14He’ll rescue them from oppression and violence;

their blood is precious to him;

15so may they live long and receive the gold of Sheba;

let them pray to him continually

and bless him all day long.	Ps 72:6-15

16May grain be abundant in the land;

may it wave on tops of the hills.

May it produce like Lebanon;

may its people blossom in the city like grass in the pasture.

17May the king’s name last forever

and grow as long as the sun shines.

Let people bless themselves by him

and all nations call him blessed.

18Bless Yahveh, the God of Israel,

who alone does wonderful things.

19Bless his glorious name forever;

may the whole world be full of his glory.

Amen and Amen.

20The end of the prayers of David Ben-Jesse 	Ps 72:16-20

BOOK 3

Psalm 73

A Psalm of Asaph

1God is good to Israel,

to those whose hearts are pure.

2I’d almost stumbled; my steps almost slipped;

3because I envied the prosperity of the arrogant.

4They don’t seem to suffer when they die;

their bodies are healthy and well.

5They don’t have trouble like other people;

they aren’t stricken like everyone else.

6So pride is the gold chain around their neck;

violence is their clothes.

7Their eyes are puffy with fatness;

they have everything they could want.

8They mock, and talk about oppressing,

and talk down to the oppressed.

9They brag against the sky itself;

their words strut across the world.	Ps 73:1-9

10So his people turn to them

and drink in all their claims.

11They say, “How does God know any of this?

Does the Most High even know what’s happening?”

12They’re the sinful,

always at ease as their wealth grows.

13It seems like I’ve kept my heart pure for nothing

and washed my hands in innocence for no reason,

14because I’m stricken all day

and endure grief every morning.	Ps 73:10-14

15If I’d talked the way I felt,

I’d have betrayed your people.

16When I tried to understand why sinners prosper,

I was troubled by it

17till I went to God’s sanctuary;

then I understood their destiny.

18You put them on slippery places

and make them slide into ruin.

19They’re quickly destroyed,

completely swept away by sudden desolation!

20They’re like dreamers when they wake up, Yahveh;

their phantoms disappear.	Ps 73:15-20

21When I was bitter and in turmoil inside,

22I was senseless and ignorant

like an animal in your presence.

23Nevertheless, I’m continually with you;

you’ve taken me by the hand.

24You’ll guide me with your advice

and afterward receive me into glory.

25Who do I have in heaven but you?

I want you more than anything on earth.

26My own flesh and heart may grow weak,

but you’re my strength and portion forever.

27Those who are far from you perish;

you destroy those who are not faithful to you.

28Your nearness to me is good for me;

I’ve made you my refuge

so I can tell everybody how you operate.	Ps 73:21-28

Psalm 74

A Maskil of Asaph

1Why have you thrown us away forever, God?

Why does your anger smoke at the sheep in your pasture?

2Remember your community that you bought so long ago,

that you redeemed as a tribe for your heritage,

Mount Zion, where you’ve lived.

3Direct your attention to its continuing ruins;

the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary.

4Your adversaries have roared in your sanctuary

and set up their own standards for signs.

5It’s like someone that used an axe in a forest;

6they broke down its carved work with hatchets and hammers.

7They burned the sanctuary to the ground

and defiled your home.

8They said to themselves, “We’ll completely subdue them”;

they set fire to your meeting places in the land.

9We don’t see miraculous signs anymore;

there aren’t any prophets;

nobody knows how long this will last.

10How long will your adversaries scoff, God,

and mock you? Forever?

11Why hold back from doing something?

Why keep your right hand against your chest?	Ps 74:1-11

12Yet you’re my king from ancient times,

who provided deliverance on the earth.

13You divided the sea by your power

and bashed the heads of sea monsters in the water.

14You crushed Leviathan’s heads

and made it into food for animals in the open country.

15You opened springs and torrents,

and dried up flowing rivers.

16Day and night belong to you;

you put the sun and stars in place.

17You established boundaries for the land

and marked out summer and winter.	Ps 74:12-17

18Remember, Yahveh, that your enemies are scorning you;

foolish people are ridiculing you.

19Don’t deliver your turtledove to a wild animal;

don’t forget forever the life of your hurting people.

20Have regard for your covenant

because the land is filled with violent places.

21Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed;

let the poor and needy praise you.

22Stand up for yourself, God;

remember how foolish people scoff at you all day long.

23Don’t forget the clamor of your adversaries,

the constant uproar of those who rebel against you.	Ps 74:18-23

Psalm 75

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

A Song; Set to Do Not Destroy

1Thank you, God, for being close by;

people declare your wonderful deeds.

2“When I set a time for judgment;

I’ll judge even-handedly.

3The earth and everybody in it melt;

I’m the One that firmly set its pillars.

4I said to people that brag, ‘Stop it,’

and to sinners, ‘Don’t lift up your horns;

5don’t raise them up high

or talk with such arrogance.’”	Ps 75:1-5

6Exaltation doesn’t come from the east or west,

7but from God, the judge;

he puts one person down and raises another up.

8There’s a cup of foaming wine in his hand;

he has mixed it well and pours it out;

sinners have to drain it and drink its dregs.

9I’ll sing praise to Jacob’s God;

I’ll declare it forever.

10He’ll cut off the horns of the wicked,

but lift up the righteous. 	Ps 75:6-10

Psalm 76

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

A Song. On Stringed Instruments

1God is known in Judah;

his name is great in Israel.

2His home is in Salem;

he lives on Zion.

3He has broken flaming arrows there,

shields, swords, and weapons of war.

4You’re glorious, more majestic

than mountains full of beasts of prey.

5Our stouthearted enemies have been stripped of their spoil;

they’ve sunk into deep sleep;

none of the soldiers could raise a hand against us.

6At your rebuke, God of Jacob,

horse and rider were thrown down into dead sleep.

7You’re to be respected;

who can withstand you when you’re angry?	Ps 76:1-7

8You rendered judgment from heaven;

the earth lay silent in fear

9when you arose to measure out judgment,

to save the oppressed on earth.

10People’s wrath only heightens your honor;

you dress yourself with the ashes of their anger.

11Make your vows to Yahveh your God and fulfill them;

let everyone bring gifts to the One they need to respect.

12He breaks the pride of princes;

kings on earth respect him.	Ps 76:8-12

Psalm 77

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

Set to Jeduthun

1I raise my voice up to God; I call out loud;

it rises to him so he’ll hear me.

2When trouble comes, I turn to Yahveh for help.

All night I reach out to him,

but I get no reassurance.

3When I think about him, I’m shaken;

I sigh and feel faint.

4He won’t let me sleep;

I’m in such distress I can’t pray.

5I think about days gone by, years ago.

6I remember singing during the night,

meditating and pondering in my mind.	Ps 77:1-6

7Will Yahveh reject me forever now?

Won’t he ever be kind to me again?

8Has his enduring love stopped permanently?

Have his promises come to an end?

9Has he forgotten to be gracious?

In his anger has he withdrawn his mercy?

10I said, “It’s my destiny

that Yahveh has turned against me.”

11Then I reconsider what all you’ve done, Yahveh,

and recall your wonders from of old.

12I think about everything you do.

13Your way is holy;

What god is as great as you?

14You work wonders

and demonstrate your power among the nations.

15You’ve rescued your people by your strength,

descendants of Jacob and Joseph.	Ps 77:7-15

16When the water faced you, God,

it tremored to its depths.

17Clouds poured down water;

the sky thundered;

your arrows flashed.

18You thundered in the whirlwind;

lightning flashes lit up the landscape;

the ground shook.

19You went through the sea;

your path led into deep water,

but your footprints didn’t show.

20You led your people like a flock

by the hand of Moses and Aaron.	Ps 77:16-20

Psalm 78

Maskil of Asaph

1Listen to my instruction, my people;

pay attention to what I’m saying.

2I’ll tell a parable and offer hidden truths from our history,

3things we’ve heard and known from our ancestors.

4We won’t keep them from our children;

we’ll tell the next generation what we praise Yahveh for:

his strength, the amazing things he’s done.	Ps 78:1-4

5He established a Testimony in Jacob

and appointed a Law in Israel,

one that he commanded our ancestors

to teach their children;

6so the coming generation would know—

children not yet born—

so they’d grow up and tell their children

7to put their confidence in God,

not forget what he’s done,

and keep his commands.

8They weren’t to be like their ancestors,

stubborn and rebellious,

who didn’t prepare their heart,

whose spirit wasn’t faithful to God.

9The Ephraimites were archers equipped with bows;

yet they retreated in battle.

10They didn’t keep God’s covenant

or follow his Law.	Ps 78:5-10

11They forgot what he’d done,

the miracles he’d shown them.

12He performed wonders for their ancestors to see

in Egypt and in the plain of Zoan.

13He divided the sea so they could pass through it

and made the water stand in a pile.

14He led them with a cloud in the daytime

and the light of fire at night.

15He split rocks open in the desert

to give them drinking water in abundance.

16He brought streams out of rock

and made water run like a river.

17Yet they continued to sin against him,

to rebel against the Most High in the desert.

18In their heart they put him to trial

by asking for food they’d like better.

19They spoke against him

“Can God prepare a table in the desert?

20He struck the rock, and water gushed out

and streams overflowed.

Can he give us bread too?

Can he feed us meat?”	Ps 78:11-20

21When Yahveh heard it, he was furious;

his wrath burned like fire against Jacob;

his anger flared at Israel

22because they didn’t believe in him

or trust in him to deliver them.

23Yet he commanded the clouds above

and opened the doors in the sky,

24and rained down manna on them

and gave them bread from the sky to eat.

25People ate the bread of angels;

God sent them food in abundance.

26He made the east wind blow

and directed the south wind by his power.

27When he rained meat on them as plentiful as dust—

winged fowl as abundant as sand by the sea—

28he let them fall in the camp around the tents.	Ps 78:21-28

29So they ate their fill of what they craved.

30Before they’d satisfied their desire,

while their food was in their mouths,

31God’s anger swelled up against them;

he killed their strongest

and cut down Israel’s picked men.

32In spite of that, they still sinned

and didn’t believe in his wonderful deeds.

33So he brought their days to an end in futility,

their years in terror.	Ps 78:29-33

34When he started taking their lives,

they finally repented and turned to  him diligently.

35They remembered that he was their rock,

that the Most High God was their redeemer.

36But they tried to flatter him and lie to him

37because they weren’t being honest with him

or faithful to his covenant.

38But in his mercy, he forgave their sin

and didn’t destroy them;

he often restrained his anger

and didn’t express all his wrath.

39He remembered that they were mortal,

wind that blows and doesn’t return.

40How often they rebelled against him in the desert

and grieved him there!

41Again and again they tested him

and pained the Holy One of Israel.	Ps 78:34-41

42They didn’t keep in mind his power

or his rescuing them from their foe

43as when he performed his signs in Egypt

and his miracles in the plain of Zoan:

44he turned their streams to blood

so they couldn’t drink from them;

45he sent swarms of flies that devoured them

and frogs to devour them;

46he gave their crops to caterpillars

and the product from their labor to locusts;

47he destroyed their grapevines with hail

and their sycamore-figs with sleet;

48he exposed their cattle to hailstones

and their flocks to lightning bolts;

49he let loose his hot anger on them:

fury, indignation, and distress—

a band of destroying messengers;

50he directed his anger against them,

not sparing them from plague and death;

51he struck Egypt’s firstborn,

the oldest sons in the tents of Ham.

52Then he led his own people out like sheep

and guided them in the desert like a flock.

53He led them safely so they weren’t afraid,

but the sea drowned their enemies.	Ps 78:42-53

54He brought them to his holy land,

to this hill country that he’d won.

55He drove out the nations in front of them,

divided up the land for an inheritance,

and enabled the tribes of Israel to live in their tents.

56Yet they tested him and rebelled against the Most High God,

and didn’t observe his testimonies.

57They were as unreliable as a crooked bow.

58They provoked him with their high places

and aroused his jealousy with their carved images.	Ps 78:54-58

59When God heard it, he was angry

and came to abhor Israel.

60So he abandoned his house in Shiloh,

the Tabernacle he’d pitched among them.

61He let his powerful Ark be captured

and surrendered his honor to the adversary.

62He allowed the sword to destroy his people

and vented his anger on his inheritance.

63Fire consumed his young men;

virgins had no wedding songs.

64His priests fell by the sword,

and widows couldn’t weep.	Ps 78:59-64

65Then Yahveh woke up as from sleeping,

like a soldier aroused from drunkenness.

66He routed his adversaries

and put them to eternal shame.

67He rejected Joseph’s descendants

and chose not to keep the tribe of Ephraim,

68but chose Judah, Mount Zion that he loved.

69He built his sanctuary as high as the sky,

as enduring as the earth.

70He chose David his servant,

took him from the sheepfolds,

71from tending ewes that had young

to shepherding Jacob his people,

Israel his inheritance.

72He shepherded them with a godly heart

and led them with skillful hands.	Ps 78:65-72

Psalm 79

A Psalm of Asaph

1Other nations have invaded your inheritance, God;

they’ve defiled your holy Temple

and laid Jerusalem in ruins.

2They’ve given the buzzards your servants’ corpses,

and the wild animals the flesh of your holy people.

3They’ve poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem;

there wasn’t anybody to bury them.

4We’ve become a disgrace to our neighbors,

mocked and derided by the people around us.

5Yahveh, will you be angry forever?

Will your jealousy keep burning like fire?	Ps 79:1-5

6Pour out your wrath on nations that don’t know you,

that don’t call on you;

7they’ve devastated Jacob and laid waste his realm.

8Don’t hold our ancestors’ sins against us;

bring us mercy quickly because we’re in despair.

9For your honor, help us, God who delivers;

forgive our sins for your name’s sake.

10Why should the nations say, “Where’s their God?”

Show those nations your vengeance

for your servants’ blood that they shed.

11Listen to the moaning prisoner;

with your great power save those doomed to die.

12Repay our neighbors seven times over

for the taunts they’ve leveled at you, Yahveh,

13so we, your people, the sheep in your pasture,

can be eternally grateful to you

and recount your praise to all generations.	Ps 79:6-13

Psalm 80

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

Set to Lilies; A Testimony

1Listen, Shepherd of Israel,

you that lead Joseph like a flock;

show your glory,

you that are enthroned above the cherubs.

2Stir up your power against Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh;

and come to rescue us.

3Restore us, God;

look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:1-3

4Yahveh God of Hosts,

how long will you be angry with our prayers?

5You’ve fed us tears

and made us drink them in full measure.

6You made us a taunt to our neighbors;

they laugh at us among themselves.

7God of Hosts, restore us;

look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:4-7

8You took a grapevine out of Egypt,

drove out the Canaanite nations,

and planted it in their land.

9You cleared the ground for it;

it took deep root and spread across the whole land.

10It covered the mountains with its shadow

and God’s cedars with its branches.

11It grew its branches all the way out to the Mediterranean Sea,

its shoots as far as the Euphrates River.

12Why did you tear down its walls

so everybody that goes by can pick its fruit?

13A boar from the woods roots it up;

whatever moves in the countryside feeds on it.	Ps 80:8-13

14God of Hosts, please come back now;

look down from heaven and take care of this grapevine,

15the root you planted,

the son you’ve raised for your use.

16Our enemies have cut it down and burned it;

may they perish at the rebuke from your angry look.

17Encourage the man at your right hand,

the son you made strong for yourself.

18Then we won’t turn away from you anymore;

revive us so we can call on you again.

19Yahveh God of Hosts, restore us;

look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:14-19

Psalm 81

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

Set to The Gittith

1Sing to God your Strength;

make a joyful sound to Jacob’s God.

2Sing, beat the tambourine,

pluck the lyre and harp.

3At the new moons blow your ram’s horn,

at the full moon and on your festival days.

4It’s a statute for Israel,

an ordinance from Jacob’s God.

5He established it as a Testimony in Joseph

when he displayed his power all over Egypt.

I heard a language I didn’t know, saying.	Ps 81:1-5

6“I’ll take the burden off your shoulders

and free you from heavy labor.

7You cried out in trouble, and I rescued you;

I answered you while I concealed myself in a thundercloud;

I tested you when you had no water at Meribah.

8Listen, my people, when I admonish you;

Israel, if only you’ll listen!

9There’s to be no foreign god among you;

don’t worship any alien deity.

10I’m Yahveh your God

who brought you out of Egypt.

Open your mouth, and I’ll fill it.”	Ps 81:6-10

11“But my people ignored me;

Israel wouldn’t obey.

12So I let them follow their stubborn heart

and go after their own devices.

13If only they’d listen!

If Israel would just follow my ways,

14I’d quickly subdue their enemies;

I’d turn my hand against their foes,

15I’d doom forever

those who hate me while pretending to obey me.

16I want to feed you with the finest wheat

and satisfy you with wild honey from the rocky cliffs.”	Ps 81:11-16

Psalm 82

A Psalm of Asaph

1God presides over the divine council

and judges you judges.

2So how long will youpl judge unjustly

by showingpl partiality to lawbreakers?

3Renderpl justice to the weak and fatherless;

standpl up for the oppressed and destitute.

4Rescuepl the weak and needy;

deliverpl them from bad people. 	Ps 82:1-4

5You don’t know or understand;

You’re walking around in the dark;

the very foundations of your world are unstable.

6I say, “You’re gods,

children of the Most High,

7but you’ll die like other mortals

and fall like anyone else.”

8You judge the world, God!

You’re the One that owns the nations.	Ps 82:5-8

Psalm 83

A Song. A Psalm of Asaph

1God, don’t keep quiet; don’t be silent.

2Your enemies are making an uproar;

those who hate you are exalting themselves.

3They’re plotting against your people,

conspiring against them 4and saying,

“Let’s wipe out their nation

so no one will remember them anymore.”

5Together they’re signing a treaty against you:

6Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites;

7Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;

Philistia and the people in Tyre;

8Assyria has joined them too;

they’re allied with Lot’s descendants.	Ps 83:1-8

9Deal with them like you dealt with Midian,

with Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River,

10that you destroyed at En-dor,

that became like manure on the ground.

11Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb

and their officials like Zebah and Zalmunna,

12who said, “Let’s take over God’s pastures.”	Ps 83:9-12

13Make them like whirling dust,

like chaff in the wind.

14Like a wildfire that burns a whole forest,

like a flame that sets mountains on fire;

15chase them with your storm;

terrify them with your tempest.

16Write shame all over their faces

till they submit to you, Yahveh.

17Frighten them forever;

let them die in disgrace

18so they’ll know that you

are supreme over the whole world.	Ps 83:13-18

Psalm 84

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

Set to The Gittith

1Your Temple is so beautiful, Yahveh of Hosts!

2I long, yes, even faint with longing for your courts;

my body and soul sing for joy to the living God.

3Even a sparrow finds a home for herself,

a swallow builds a nest to raise her young

near your altars, Yahveh of Hosts, my God and King.

4How blessed they are who live in your Temple

and continually sing your praises.

5How blessed people are whose strength comes from you,

who’ve resolved to make pilgrimages to Zion!

6As they pass through the Valley of Weeping,

they turn it into a spring;

autumn rains cover it with blessings.

7They grow from strength to more strength

till each one appears before God in Zion.	Ps 84:1-7

8Yahveh God of hosts, listen to my prayer;

listen to me, God of Jacob!

9Extend your favor to the shield

you anointed over us,

10because one day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere.

I’d rather stand at the threshold of your Temple

than live at ease in the tents of sinners,

11because Yahveh is sun and shield,

who gives grace and honor

and doesn’t withhold anything good from those who do what’s right.

12Yahveh of hosts, how blessed they are who trust in you! Ps 84:8-12

Psalm 85

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1Yahveh, you blessed your land;

you restored the fortunes of Jacob;

2you forgave your people’s iniquity

and pardoned their sins;

3you withdrew your fury

and turned away from your hot anger.

4Restore us, our Deliverer;

end your displeasure with us.

5Will you be angry with us forever?

Will you extend your wrath to every generation?

6Won’t you revive us

so we can celebrate over you?

7Show us your enduring love, Yahveh;

grant us your salvation.	Ps 85:1-7

8I’ll listen to what our God Yahveh says,

because he offers peace to his holy people,

those who avoid foolish behavior.

9His salvation is nearby for those who respect him,

so there can be honor in our land.

10Truth and enduring love combine;

goodness and peace kiss each other.

11Faithfulness grows up from the ground,

and goodness looks down from the sky.

12Yahveh gives what’s good

so our land can yield its produce.

13Goodness goes ahead of him

and makes his footprints into a path.	Ps 85:8-13

Psalm 86

A Prayer of David

1Listen, Yahveh, and answer me

because I’m troubled and in need.

2Preserve my life because I’m a godly man;

save me because I trust in you.

3Be gracious to me

because I call out to you all the time.

4Make me happy

because I hold up my life to you.

5You’re good, ready to forgive,

and abundant in enduring love

to everyone that calls on you.

6Hear my prayer, Yahveh;

listen to my petition.

7When I’m in trouble, I call on you

because you answer me.

8There’s no one like you among the gods,

no other deeds like yours.

9All the nations you’ve made will come

to worship you and honor you,

10because you’re great and do great things;

only you are God.	Ps 86:1-10

11Teach me your way;

I’ll follow your truth;

make me consistently respect you.

12I’ll thank you, Yahveh my God, with all my heart

and honor you forever

13because you show me such enduring love;

you’ve rescued me from the depths of Sheol.	Ps 86:11-13

14Arrogant people are attacking me, God;

a gang of violent men wants to kill me;

they don’t care about you.

15But you’re a merciful, gracious God,

slow to get angry

and abundant in enduring love and faithfulness.

16Turn to me and be gracious;

give me your strength;

save your servant’s son.

17Show me a sign of your favor

so the ones that hate me can see it and be put to shame,

because you’ve helped me and reassured me.	Ps 86:14-17

Psalm 87

A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1The city that Yahveh founded stands on his holy mountain;

2he loves Zion more than the other places in Jacob.

3Glorious things are said about you, city of God.

4“I’ll count Rahab [Egypt] and Babylon among those who know me,

Philistia, Tyre, and Nubia too:

‘They’ve become citizens there,’” people will say.

5But they will say about Zion,

“This one and that one were born here”;

the Most High himself has made it so.

6When Yahveh registers the nations,

he’ll say, “They’ve all become citizens here.”

7Then those who sing and those who play flutes will say,

“The springs of all our joy are in you.”	Ps 87:1-7

Psalm 88

A Song. Set to Mahalath Leannoth

A Maskil of Herman the Ezrahite

1Yahveh God who keeps me safe,

I call out to you day and night.

2Let my prayer come to you;

listen to my call!

3I’ve had so much trouble;

I’m close to Sheol.

4I’m as good as dead,

like someone with no strength left.

5Abandoned among the dead

like someone slain in the grave,

I’m forgotten and cut off from you.

6You’ve put me in the Pit,

in regions dark and deep.

7Your anger overwhelms me;

wave after wave weighs heavily on me.

8You’ve made my friends avoid me

by making me someone they detest;

I’m trapped and can’t escape.

9My sight is blurry from tears;

I call on you every day, Yahveh,

and reach out to you for help.	Ps 88:1-9

10Do you perform wonders for the dead?

Do departed spirits rise and praise you?

11Do they declare your enduring love in the grave

or your faithfulness in the place of destruction?

12Are your wonders known in the dark

or your goodness in the land of forgetfulness?	Ps 88:10-12

13Yahveh, I call out to you for help;

in the mornings my prayers go up to you.

14Why are you rejecting me?

Why are you hiding from me?

15I’ve been attacked and close to death from my youth up;

I suffer from the terrors you bring; I’m overwhelmed.

16Your furious anger has swept over me;

your dreaded assaults have destroyed me.

17They surround me like water all the time

and engulf me completely.

18You’ve removed lover and friend far from me;

my companions lie in darkness.	Ps 88:13-18

Psalm 89

A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite

1I’ll sing forever about Yahveh’s enduring love

and make known his faithfulness to every generation,

2because I’ve said, “You build up enduring love;

in the heavens you establish your faithfulness.”

3Yahveh said, “I’ve made a covenant with my chosen one;

I’ve sworn to David my servant,

4‘I’ll make your descendants secure forever

and build up your throne to all generations.’”	Ps 89:1-4

5The sky praises your wonders

and extols your faithfulness in the assembly of your holy angels.

6Who in the sky can compare with you?

Who among the heavenly beings is like you,

7a God greatly respected in the council of holy angels

and awesome above everyone around him?

8Lord Yahveh of Hosts, who is like you?

You’re completely faithful.

9You rule the raging sea;

when its waves rise up, you quiet them.

10You’ve crushed Rahab like one that’s slain

and scattered your enemies with your strong arm.	Ps 89:5-10

11The sky is yours; the earth belongs to you;

you’ve founded the world and everything in it.

12You’ve created north and south;

Tabor and Hermon shout for joy over you.

13You have a powerful arm and a strong hand;

you lift your right hand high.

14Goodness and justice make the foundation for your throne;

enduring love and truth proceed ahead of you.

15How blessed people are who know the sound of joy,

who walk in the light of your presence, Yahveh.

16In your name they celebrate all day;

your goodness lifts their spirits.

17They glory in your strength;

your blessing honors them.

18Their shield belongs to Yahveh;

their king belongs to the Holy One of Israel.	Ps 89:11-18

19Long ago you said in a vision to your holy people,

“I’ve crowned a great man,

chosen from the common people.

20I found my servant David

and anointed him with my holy oil.

21My hand will make him secure;

my arm will give him strength.

22His enemies won’t outsmart him;

sinful people won’t oppress him.

23I’ll crush his adversaries

and strike down those who hate him.

24My faithfulness and enduring love will be with him,

and I’ll make him honored.	Ps 89:19-24

25I’ll establish his rule as far as the sea

and set his control over the rivers.

26He’ll call out to me, ‘My Father,

my God, the Rock that keeps me safe.’

27I’ll make him my firstborn,

the highest among the kings on earth.

28I’ll keep my enduring love for him forever

and confirm my covenant with him.

29I’ll make his descendants permanently secure,

his throne as eternal as the sky.	Ps 89:25-29

30“If his descendants leave my Law

and don’t follow my judgments,

31if they violate my statutes

and don’t keep my commandments,

32then I’ll bring a rod to bear on their sin

and stripes on their iniquity.

33But I won’t break off my enduring love from him

or deal falsely in my faithfulness.

34I won’t violate my covenant

or alter what I’ve said.

35Once I’ve sworn by my holiness,

I won’t lie to David.

36His descendants will continue permanently,

his throne will last like the sun with me.

37It’ll be secure as permanently as the moon,

as faithful as its witness in the sky.”	Ps 89:30-37

38But, you’ve thrown him away and rejected him;

you’re angry with your anointed.

39You’ve spurned the covenant with him

and profaned his crown in the dust.

40You’ve broken down his walls

and brought his fortresses to ruin.

41Everyone that passes by plunders him;

he’s become a disgrace to his neighbors.

42You’ve raised up his adversaries

and made them celebrate.

43You’ve turned back the edge of his sword

and haven’t made him stand in battle.

44You made his splendor cease

and threw his throne on the ground.

45You’ve shortened his youth

and covered him with shame.	Ps 89:38-45

46How long, Yahveh,

will you conceal yourself,

will your anger burn like fire?

47Remember how long life is.

What emptiness have you created people for?

48Who can live without dying?

Can anyone avoid Sheol?	Ps 89:46-48

49Where’s your former enduring love

that you faithfully swore to David?

50Remember the scorn your servants endure,

how I carry many people’s insults inside me

51that your enemies have used for taunts,

that they’ve mocked your anointed one with.

52Bless Yahveh forever!

Amen and Amen.	Ps 89:49-52

BOOK 4

Psalm 90

A Prayer of Moses the Man of God

1Yahveh, through all generations

you’ve been our dwelling place.

2Before the mountains were born

or you gave birth to the world,

from one end of time to the other, you’ve been God.	Ps 90:1-2

3You turn people back to dust and say,

“Return to dust, mortals.”

4A thousand years to you

are like yesterday,

like a watch in the night.

5You sweep us away like the dreams in our sleep.

In the morning we sprout like grass 6and flourish;

then toward evening we fade like blossoms

and wither away.

7Your anger consumes us;

your wrath scares us.

8You place our iniquities in front of you;

our secret sins are open to you.

9All our days pass away in your fury;

we finish our years with a sigh.

10We live for 70 years or by good health for 80 years;

yet whatever their length, they’re full of labor and pain

because they’re gone so soon, and we fly away.

11Who understands the power of your anger and fury

in comparison to the respect you deserve?

12So teach us to count our days

so we can grow in wisdom toward you.	Ps 90:3-12

13Come back to us, Yahveh; how long will it be?

Have pity on your servants.

14Satisfy us in the morning with your enduring love

so we can sing and be happy our whole life.

15Make us happy for as long as you’ve punished us,

for the years we’ve had misfortune.

16Let us see your work

and our children witness your majesty.

17Bless us, Yahveh our God;

make our efforts successful;

yes, make them succeed!	Ps 90:13-17

Psalm 91

1Those who live in the shelter of the Most High

will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

2They’ll say about Yahveh,

“Our refuge and fortress, the God we trust!”	Ps 91:1-2

3He delivers you from the trapper’s snare

and deadly pestilence.

4He covers you with his pinions;

you can find refuge under his wings;

his faithfulness shields and protects you.

5You won’t be afraid of terrors at night,

of arrows that fly by day,

6of pestilence that lurks in the dark,

or destruction that lays waste at noon.

7A thousand may fall at your side,

ten thousand by your right hand;

but disaster won’t touch you.

8You’ll stand by and watch his recompense to the wicked,

9because you’ve made Yahveh your refuge,

the Most High your hiding place.

10Misfortune won’t fall on you;

no plague will get near you.	Ps 91:3-10

11He’ll make his angels responsible

for guarding you whatever you do.

12They’ll carry you

so you won’t trip over a rock.

13You’ll step on lions and cobras

and crush them.

14“I’ll rescue them that love me

and set up high those who know me.

15They’ll call on me, and I’ll answer them;

I’ll be with them in trouble,

rescue and honor them.

16I’ll satisfy them with long life

and give them salvation.”	Ps 91:11-16

Psalm 92

A Psalm

A Song for the Sabbath

1It’s good to thank you, Yahveh,

to sing praises to you, Most High;

2to declare your enduring love in the morning

and your faithfulness at night

3with a lute and a ten-stringed harp,

with melody on a lyre.

4Because you’ve made me happy by what you’ve done,

I’ll sing for joy over what you do.	Ps 92:1-4

5Your deeds are so great, Yahveh,

your thoughts so deep!

6Senseless people don’t realize,

ignorant mortals don’t understand

7that when sinners sprout up like grass

and the wicked flourish,

it’s only that they’ll be destroyed forever.

8But you’re on high forever.

9Your enemies will perish;

everybody that sins will scatter.	Ps 92:5-9

10You’ve made me as strong as a wild ox

and anointed me with fresh oil.

11I’ve looked in triumph at my enemies

and heard about the defeat of my attackers.

12Good people flourish like palm trees;

they grow like cedars in Lebanon.

13Planted in Yahveh’s Temple,

they flourish in the courts of our God.

14They bear fruit even when they’re old;

they’re still green and full of energy.

15They declare that Yahveh is good,

that he’s our rock; there’s nothing bad about him.	Ps 92:10-15

Psalm 93

1Yahveh reigns, robed in majesty,

dressed in strength.

The world stands firm; it won’t move.

2Your throne has been secure from of old;

you’re from eternity past.

3The floods have swelled;

the roar of their pounding waves has increased.

4But more than the thunder of overwhelming water,

more than the mighty ocean breakers against the shore,

Yahveh on high, you are powerful.

5Your decrees stand firm;

holiness adorns your Temple forever.	Ps 93:1-5

Psalm 94

1Yahveh God of vengeance, shine!

2Rise up, Judge of the whole world;

repay the proud.

3How long will you let sinners celebrate?

4How long will they pour out their arrogant words,

vaunt themselves up

5crush your people,

attack your heritage

6murder widows and foreigners and orphans,

7and say, “Yahveh’s not watching;

Jacob’s God is not paying attention.”	Ps 94:1-7

8You silly people, you pay attention;

when will you ever understand?

9Can’t he hear, who created the ear?

Can’t he see, who formed the eye?

10Won’t he that rebukes nations, discipline you;

doesn’t the Source of knowledge know what you’re doing?

11Yahveh knows that your thoughts

are nothing but hot air.

12The ones you discipline are blessed, Yahveh,

the ones you teach out of the Law;

13so you can grant them relief in adversity,

till you dig a pit for the wicked.

14Yahveh won’t abandon his people

or forsake his inheritance.

15The administration of justice will be good again,

and the godly will follow it.

16Who else will stand up for me against evil people?

Who else will take a stand for me against sinners? 	Ps 94:8-16

17If Yahveh hadn’t helped me,

I would soon have occupied the silent place.

18When I cried out, “I’m slipping,”

his enduring love kept me from falling.

19When my anxious thoughts multiplied,

he cheered me up.

20Can corrupt rulers be his allies

and plot schemes with their wicked laws?

21Can they gang up on good people

and condemn the innocent to death?

22No, because Yahveh is my fortress;

my God the Rock is my refuge.

23He’ll bring their sinfulness back on them

and destroy them with their own evil;

Yahveh our God will wipe them out.	Ps 94:17-23

Psalm 95

1Come, let’s sing to Yahveh;

let’s make a joyful sound to the Rock that saves us.

2Let’s go to him with thanksgiving

and sing to him with psalms.

3Yahveh is a great God,

a great King above all gods.

4He controls the deep sea;

he owns the mountain peaks

5and the ocean because he created them;

he made the dry land.	Ps 95:1-5

6Come, let’s bow in worship;

let’s kneel to Yahveh our Maker.

7He’s our God, and we’re sheep in his pasture,

the flock under his care.

If you hear him today,

8don’t harden your hearts like they did at Meribah

that day at Massah in the desert.

9Your ancestors kept testing me

though they’d been seeing my work for 40 years.

10I detested that generation and said,

“They err in their hearts;

they don’t know my ways.”

11So I swore in my anger,

“They certainly won’t enter my rest.”	Ps 95:6-11

Psalm 96

1Sing a new song to Yahveh;

sing to him, all the earth.

2Bless him in song;

proclaim every day the good news that he saves.

3Tell about his glory the world over,

his marvelous deeds among the nations.

4Yahveh is great and deserves great praise;

he’s to be respected more than all gods

5because the nations’ gods are idols,

but Yahveh created the sky.

6Honor and majesty lie in him;

strength and beauty fill his sanctuary.	Ps 96:1-6

7Families of the nations,

attribute to Yahveh honor and strength.

8Attribute to Yahveh the glory he deserves;

take an offering to his courts.

9Worship him in holy attire;

tremble at him, all the earth.

10Say among the nations, “Yahveh reigns;

yes, the world is firmly set; it won’t move;

he’ll judge the nations fairly.”

11Let the heavens be happy and the earth rejoice;

let the ocean roar and everything that’s in it;

12let the fields celebrate and all that grows there;

then the trees in the forest will sing 13to Yahveh

because he’ll judge the world with justice

and its people with truth.	Ps 96:7-13

Psalm 97

1Yahveh reigns; let the world rejoice;

let the distant shores be glad.

2Clouds and dense darkness surround him;

goodness and justice are the foundation for his throne.

3Fire goes forth ahead of him

and burns up his adversaries.

4His lightning lights up the world;

the world sees it and trembles.

5The mountains melt like wax

at hisY presence everywhere.

6The sky declares his goodness;

every nation can see his glory.	Ps 97:1-6

7Let those who worship carved images be discredited,

those who take pride in idols;

bow to him, all you gods.

8Zion hears that and is happy;

the towns in Judah celebrate

because of your justice, Yahveh,

9You’re greater than all gods.

10Hate evil, you that love Yahveh,

who preserves his holy people

and delivers them from sinners.

11Light is sown like seed for the godly,

like happiness for the godly in heart.

12Be happy in him, good people;

praise him for his holiness.	Ps 97:7-12

Psalm 98

A Psalm

1Sing a new song to Yahveh

because he’s done outstanding things;

his right hand and holy arm have given him victory.

2He has made his salvation known

and revealed his goodness to the nations.

3He has remembered his enduring love

and faithfulness to Israel;

people the earth over have seen

the deliverance our God gives. 	Ps 98:1-3

4Make a joyful sound to Yahveh, all the earth;

break out in joyful song.

5Sing praises to him with lyre and melody;

6make a joyful sound with trumpets and rams’ horns

to the King, Yahveh.

7Let the ocean roar and everything in it,

the world and those who live here.

8Let the rivers clap their hands;

let the mountains sing 9to Yahveh

because he’s coming to judge the world righteously

and its people fairly.	Ps 98:4-9

Psalm 99

1Yahveh reigns;

let the people tremble;

he sits on his throne above the cherubs;

let the earth quake!

2Yahveh is great in Zion;

he’s exalted above all nations.

3Let them praise his great, awesome name;

he is holy.

4The great King who loves justice

has established what’s fair for all.

5Exalt Yahveh our God

and worship at his feet;	he is holy.	Ps 99:1-5

6Moses and Aaron were among his priests;

Samuel too was one who called on him;

they called on Yahveh and he answered them.

7He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud;

they kept the testimonies and statutes he gave them.

8He was a forgiving God;

yet he disciplined them for their sins.

9Exalt Yahveh our God

and worship on his holy mountain; because

he is holy.	Ps 99:6-9

Psalm 100

A Psalm for Thanksgiving

1Make a joyful sound to Yahveh, all the earth.

2Serve him gladly;

come to him with singing.

3Acknowledge that Yahveh is God;

he made us; we didn’t make ourselves.

We’re his people, sheep in his pasture.

4Enter his gates with thanksgiving

and his courts with praise.

Thank him and bless him 5because he’s good;

his enduring love never ends;

his faithfulness extends to every generation.	Ps 100:1-5

Psalm 101

A Psalm of David

1I’ll sing about your enduring love and justice,

and sing praises to you, Yahveh.

2I’ll pay attention to the way that’s blameless;

when will you come to help me?

In my home I’ll walk in integrity.

3I won’t set anything base beside me;

I’ll hate what they do who fall away;

I’ll stay away from them.

4I’ll cast perverse things out of my heart

and have nothing to do with evil.

5I’ll withdraw from anyone that slanders another;

I won’t put up with people

that have haughty looks or arrogant hearts. 	Ps 101:1-5

6I’ll focus my attention on the faithful

to be my friends.

Those who follow the blameless way

are the ones that will be my servants.

7I won’t let deceivers serve in my Temple;

liars won’t maintain their relationship with me.

8Each morning I’ll destroy the wicked in the land

and rid the city of Yahveh of everyone that sins. 	Ps 101:6-8

Psalm 102

A Prayer by the Oppressed When They’re Faint

and Pour Out Their Complaint to Yahveh

1Listen to my prayer, Yahveh!

Let my cry come to you.

2Don’t turn away from me in my distress;

when I call, answer quickly.

3My days dissipate like smoke;

my bones lie scorched on a hearth.

4My heart is weak and withers away like grass;

I have no appetite 5in my loud groaning;

I’m skin and bones.

6I’m like a pelican in the desert,

like an owl in desolate places;

7I lie awake

like a lonely bird on a housetop.	Ps 102:1-7

8My enemies taunt me all day;

they ridicule me and use my name as a curse.

9I eat ashes for food

and mix my drink with tears

10because of your indignation,

because you’ve thrown me away.

11My days are like a shadow;

I wither like the grass.

12But you live forever, Yahveh;

you endure for all generations.

13Have mercy on Zion;

it’s time to be gracious to it;

the appointed time has come.

14Your servants delight in its very rocks

and have regard even for its dust.

15So the nations will respect Yahveh;

kings will respect your honor.

16Yahveh will build up Zion;

he’ll appear in his glory.

17He’ll have regard for the destitute;

he won’t disregard their prayer.	Ps 102:8-17

18Write this for the next generation,

so people not yet born will praise Yahveh:

19He looked down from his holy height;

from heaven he gazed at earth

20to hear the groaning prisoners,

to free those doomed to die;

21so people will celebrate Yahveh in Zion

and praise him in Jerusalem

22when the nations gather

and the kingdoms assemble to serve him.	Ps 102:18-22

23He weakened my strength

in the course of my life and shortened it.

24 I say to him,

My God, don’t take me away in the middle of life;

you live throughout all generations.

25You founded the earth long ago;

the sky is your handiwork.

26Even they will perish, but you’ll remain;

they’ll wear out like a robe,

and you’ll change them like clothes.

27But you’ll be the same; your years won’t end.

28Your people’s children will continue in security;

their descendants will thrive in your presence.”	Ps 102:23-28

Psalm 103

A Psalm of David

1Bless Yahveh, all that I am!

Everything that’s in me, bless him.

2Bless Yahveh, all that I am;

May I never forget how he helps me:

3he pardons my sins

and heals my diseases;

4he rescues me from the Pit

and crowns me with enduring love and mercy;

5he satisfies my years with good things,

and renews my youth like an eagle’s.	Ps 103:1-5

6Yahveh performs good deeds

and renders justice for people mistreated.

7He made his ways known to Moses

and demonstrated his acts to Israel.

8Yahveh is merciful and gracious,

slow to anger and abounding in enduring love.

9He won’t constantly confront us

or always be angry with us.

10He hasn’t dealt with us according to our sins

or rewarded us in proportion to our iniquities.

11As high as the sky is above the earth,

so great is his enduring love toward those who respect him.

12As far as the east is from the west,

that’s how far he’s removed our sins from us.

13Like a father that has mercy on his children,

Yahveh has mercy on those who respect him.

14He knows how we’re made;

he’s aware that we’re only dust.	Ps 103:6-14

15People are like grass,

they flourish like flowers in a field.

16When the wind blows on them, they’re gone

like they’d never been there.

17Yahveh’s enduring love is

from eternity past to future for them who respect him;

his goodness is to children’s children

18to those who keep his covenant,

that obey his commandments.	Ps 103:15-18

19Yahveh has secured his throne in the sky;

he’s sovereign everywhere.

20Bless Yahveh, angels, great in power,

who do what he says and obey him.

21Bless Yahveh, all his hosts

who serve him and do his will.

22Bless Yahveh, everything he’s created

everywhere he reigns.

Bless Yahveh, everything that I am!	Ps 103:19-22

Psalm 104

1Bless Yahveh, everything that I am!

Yahveh my God, you’re so great;

you’re dressed in splendor and majesty.

2You cover yourself with light as with a robe;

you’ve stretched out the sky like a tent.

3You laid the beams for your rooms on the water;

you make the clouds your chariot

and walk on the wind.

4You make the winds your messengers

and blazing fire your ministers.	Ps 104:1-4

5You built the earth on foundations

so it would never shift.

6You covered it with the ocean like a robe

deeper than the mountains.

7At your rebuke it receded;

at the sound of your thunder, it withdrew.

8The mountains rose up; the valleys sank down

to the level you determined for them to have.

9You set a boundary the water couldn’t cross

so it wouldn’t flow back over the earth again.	Ps 104:5-9

10You make springs in the valleys

so creeks flow between the mountains.

11They water the animals in the countryside

and quench the thirst of wild donkeys.

12Birds live beside them

and chirp in the trees.

13You water the mountains from your home above;

your work provides for the earth.	Ps 104:10-13

14You make grass grow for the livestock

and crops from people’s labor

so they could produce food from the ground

15and wine to cheer them up,

so they could make their faces shine with oil

and grow food to sustain them.

16Yahveh’s trees drink their fill,

Lebanon’s cedars that he planted,

17where birds build their nests

and storks make roosts in fir trees.	Ps 104:14-17

18High mountains are for wild goats,

and rocks provide cover for badgers.

19You made the moon to mark the seasons;

the sun knows where to set.

20You send darkness, and it becomes night;

wild animals prowl around in it.

21Young lions roar after their prey

and seek their food from God.

22When the sun comes up,

they go back and lie down in their dens,

23and people go out to work till evening.	Ps 104:18-23

24Yahveh, how many things you’ve done!

you’ve done them all with wisdom

and filled the earth with your creations.

25Yonder is the ocean, big and wide;

it teems with schools of fish without number,

marine life large and small.

26Ships move along on it,

Leviathan too, which you formed to play in it.	Ps 104:24-26

27They all depend on you

to feed them when it’s time.

28You give them food, and they gather it;

you open your hand and satisfy them with good.

29If you hide, they’re scared;

you take away their breath, and they die.

30You send out your breath, and they’re created;

you renew the surface of the ground.	Ps 104:27-30

31Let Yahveh’s honor endure forever;

let him delight in things he’s made.

32The world trembles at his look;

the mountains smoke at his touch.

33I’ll sing to Yahveh as long as I live;

I’ll sing praise to my God as long as I’m here.

34May my meditations please him;

I’ll be happy in him.

35Let sinners vanish from the earth;

let the wicked cease to exist.

Bless Yahveh, everything that I am!

Hallelujah!	Ps 104:31-35

Psalm 105

1Be grateful to Yahveh; call on him;

tell the nations what all he’s done.

2Sing praises to him;

talk about the amazing acts.

3Take pride in his holy name;

let the people be happy that rely on him.

4Rely on Yahveh and his strength;

depend on him always.

5Remember his amazing miracles,

the judgments he’s rendered,

6descendants of Abraham his servant,

children of Jacob, his chosen ones!

7He’s Yahveh our God,

who renders judgment all over the world.	Ps 105:1-7

8He remembers his eternal covenant,

the message he commanded to a thousand generations,

9his covenant with Abraham, his oath to Isaac.

10his statute confirmed to Jacob

as an ongoing covenant.

11He swore, “I’ll give you Canaan to inherit.”

12When they were just a few,

temporary residents,

13they wandered from nation to nation,

from kingdom to kingdom.

14He didn’t let anybody oppress them;

he reprimanded kings on their behalf:

15“Don’t touch my anointed ones;

don’t harm my prophets.”	Ps 105:8-15

16He called for a famine in the land

and cut off their food supply.

17He sent a man ahead of them,

Joseph, sold as a slave.

18They hurt his feet with restraints

and put an iron collar around his neck

19till God’s message came to him

and revealed what kind of man he was.

20The king released him;

the people’s ruler let him go.

21He made him master of his household,

steward over everything he owned,

22even to imprison his officials if he saw fit

so he could teach his elders wisdom.	Ps 105:16-22

23Then Israel/Jacob went down to Egypt

and lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.

24God multiplied his people

and made them stronger than their enemies,

25whose hearts he turned against his people

to mistreat them.

26Then he sent Moses his servant

and Aaron his chosen one

27to perform his amazing acts among them,

miracles in the land of Ham:

28he engulfed their land in darkness

when they defied him and his message;

29he turned their water to blood

and killed their fish;	Ps 105:23-29

30frogs overran the land

even into the king’s bedrooms;

31swarms of flies came,

and gnats infested the whole region;

32he gave them hail for rain,

and lightning flashed in the land;

33he struck down their grapevines and fig trees

and stripped their trees;

34he summoned countless young locusts to come

35and eat the vegetation in the country

and devour the produce from the ground;

36he struck the Egyptians’ firstborn,

the first issue of their strength.	Ps 105:30-36

37Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold;

nobody among the tribes faltered.

38The Egyptians were glad when they left

because they’d come to dread them.

39He spread a cloud over them

and sent fire to light up the night.

40They asked, and he brought quail

and satisfied them with manna from the sky.

41He opened a rock and water came out

and ran into the desert like a stream.

42He remembered his sacred promise

to Abraham his servant.

43He brought his people out with joy and celebration.

44He gave them the lands of nations,

and they harvested what those nations had grown;

45he did it so they would keep his statutes

and observe his laws.

Hallelujah!	Ps 105:37-45

Psalm 106

1Hallelujah!

Be grateful to Yahveh because he’s good;

his enduring love lasts forever.

2Who can recount all his mighty deeds?

Who can ever praise him enough?

3How blessed they are who maintain justice,

who practice goodness all the time!

4Remember me, Yahveh, when you’re gracious to your people;

come and rescue me

5so I can share in your holy people’s prosperity,

celebrate in your nation’s happiness,

and glory in your heritage.	Ps 106:1-5

6We and our ancestors have sinned,

committed iniquity, and behaved badly.

7Our ancestors in Egypt didn’t get the point of Yahveh’s amazing acts

or remember his abundant kindness;

instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.

8Nevertheless, he saved them to defend his honor

and demonstrate his power.

9He commanded the Red Sea to dry up,

and led them through its depths as through a desert.

10He saved them from those who hated them;

he rescued them from their enemy.

11The water drowned their adversaries;

not a one survived.

12Then they believed in him and praised him in song.	Ps 106:6-12

13But they soon forgot what he’d done

and didn’t wait for his direction,

14but made loud demands

and put him on trial in the desert.

15So he gave them what they asked for,

but sent a wasting disease among them.	Ps 106:13-15

16When men in the camp got jealous of Moses

and of Aaron, Yahveh’s holy priest,

17the ground opened up

and swallowed Dathan and Abiram’s rebels.

18Fire broke out among their companions

and consumed the sinful. 	Ps 106:16-18

19They made a calf at Horeb/Sinai

and worshiped a molten image;

20they exchanged their Glorious One

for an image of a bull that eats grass.

21They forgot God, who’d saved them

and done such great things in Egypt,

22amazing things in Ham,

awesome things at the Red Sea.

23So he said he’d destroy them.

If Moses, his chosen one, hadn’t stood in the gap

to turn away his wrath, he would’ve done it.

24They refused to enter the pleasant land

and didn’t believe what he promised;

25they grumbled in their tents

and didn’t listen to Yahveh.

26So he swore he’d let them die in the desert,

27disperse their descendants among the nations,

and scatter them in other lands.	Ps 106:19-27

28They joined in the worship of Baal-peor

and ate sacrifices to the dead.

29What they did provoked him

to send a plague out among them.

30Then Phinehas got up and intervened;

so the plague stopped.

31He’s been considered a good man ever since.	Ps 106:28-31

32They’d already provoked God at Meribah

and got Moses in serious trouble 33for speaking rashly.

34Later, they failed to eradicate the nations like Yahveh told them to,

35 but mixed in with them, learned their practices,

36and served their idols, which led to their downfall.

37They even sacrificed sons and daughters to the demons

38and thereby shed innocent blood,

the blood of their sons and daughters

that they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;

they polluted the land with blood.

39So they defiled themselves with their practices

and played the prostitute in their deeds.	Ps 106:32-39

40Yahveh’s anger so sparked against his people

that he abhorred his special possession.

41So he gave them over to the surrounding nations;

people that hated them ruled them;

42their enemies subdued them

and oppressed them.

43Many times he delivered them,

but they kept rebelling with their own intentions

and sank into sin.	Ps 106:40-43

44Nevertheless, he felt compassion for them

when he heard them cry out in distress.

45He remembered his covenant

and relented because of his enduring love.

46He even made their captors be kind to them.

47Save us, Yahveh our God;

retrieve us from the nations

so we can thank you and glory in praising you.

48Bless Yahveh God of Israel

from everlasting to everlasting.

Everybody say, “Amen.”

Hallelujah!	Ps 106:44-48

BOOK 5

Psalm 107

1Be grateful to Yahveh because he’s good;

his love endures forever.

2Let his redeemed say it,

the ones he rescued from their adversaries

3and gathered from other countries

east and west, north and south.	Ps 107:1-3

4Some wandered in trackless desert

and couldn’t find their way to any inhabited city.

5Hungry and thirsty,

their souls fainted inside them.

6Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,

and he delivered them from it;

7he led them straight to a city they could live in.

8They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his awesome acts for his people!

9He satisfies the thirsty

and fills the hungry with good things.	Ps 107:4-9

10Some sat in darkness and death’s shadow,

prisoners suffering in iron shackles,

11because they’d rebelled against what God said

and spurned the advice of the Most High.

12So he humbled them with labor;

they stumbled and nobody was there to help.

13Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,

and he delivered them from it.

14He brought them out of darkness and death’s shadow

and broke their chains.

15They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his awesome acts for his people!

16because he shattered bronze gates

and cut iron bars in two.	Ps 107:10-16

17Some were fools

and suffered because they rebelled and sinned.

18The very sight of food was repulsive to them;

they came close to dying.

19Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,

and he delivered them from distress.

20He sent his message to heal them

and delivered them from destruction.

21They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his wonderful acts for his people!

22Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving

and tell about his deeds with joyful singing.	Ps 107:17-22

23Some went down to ships by the sea

and did business on the ocean;

24they, too, have seen what Yahveh can do,

his powerful acts on the great deep.

25He spoke and a storm arose

that whipped up the waves,

26waves that swelled up toward the sky

and crashed down to the depths;

sailors’ courage melted away in their terror.

27They reeled and staggered like drunks;

they were at their wits’ end.

28Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,

and he delivered them from distress.

29He stilled the storm and calmed the waves.

30Then they were happy because they had quiet;

so he guided them to the port they desired.

31They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his wonderful acts for his people!

32Let them extol him in front of the community

and praise him at the elders’ seats.	Ps 107:23-32

33He transforms rivers into desert,

springs into thirsty ground,

34productive land into a salt waste

because sinful people live there.

35But he transforms a desert into a sea,

dry land into springs.

36He enables hungry people to live there

and build a city,

37sow fields, plant vineyards,

and gather a big harvest. 	Ps 107:33-37

38He blesses them and they multiply;

he keeps the number of their livestock from decreasing.

39When they’re decreased and brought low

through oppression, misery, and sorrow,

40he pours contempt on their rulers

and makes them wander in trackless wasteland.

41But he sets the needy safely on high away from adversity

and makes their families like a flock.

42The godly see it and are happy,

but bad people don’t have anything they can say.

43Who is wise? Pay attention to these things

and think about Yahveh’s’s enduring love.	Ps 107:38-43

Psalm 108

A Song. A Psalm of David

1I’m steadfast, God;

I’ll sing praises in my heart.

2Wake up, harp and lyre;

I’ll wake up at dawn!

3I’ll thank you, Yahveh, among the nations

and sing praises to you everywhere,

4because your enduring love is bigger than the sky;

your truth is as high as the heavens.

5Be lifted up, God, above the sky;

display your glory the world over.

6Save with your power and answer me

so your beloved can be delivered.	Ps 108:1-6

7God has spoken in his holiness:

“I’ll gladly divide up Shechem.

8Gilead and Manasseh belong to me;

Ephraim, my helmet;

Judah, my scepter;

9Moab, my washbasin;

I’ll wipe my feet on Edom

and shout in triumph over Philistia.”	Ps 108:7-9

10Who will take me to the besieged city?

Who will lead me to Edom?

11Are you rejecting us, God?

Aren’t you going out with our armies?

12Help us against our adversary

because human help can’t save us.

13Through you, we’ll do mightily;

you can tramp down our enemies.	Ps 108:10-13

Psalm 109

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1God that I praise, speak up for me!

2Deceitful people speak against me;

they slander me with lies.

3They surround me with hateful words

and fight me for no reason.

4In return for my love, they accuse me

even when I’m praying for them.

5They repay me evil for good,

hatred for love.	Ps 109:1-5

6Appoint someone corrupt over them,

an accuser to stand beside them.

7When they’re judged, pronounce them guilty;

count even their prayers as acts of sin.

8Shorten their lives

and give someone else their position of oversight.

9Make their children fatherless

and their wives widows.

10Have their children go begging,

looking for food far from their ruined homes.

11Have their creditors seize everything they own

and foreigners plunder what they’d labored to produce.

12May no one extend enduring love to them

or be gracious to their fatherless children.

13Cut off their posterity;

erase their names from the next generation.	Ps 109:6-13

14Yahveh, remember their fathers’ sins

and not blot out their mothers’ transgressions;

15always keep them in mind;

Have people forget they ever lived,

16because they didn’t show enduring love;

they persecuted poor, needy people,

and murdered the despondent.

17They loved to curse; put curses on them!

they didn’t like to bless; don’t bless them!

18They cover themselves with cursing like clothes;

it soaks into their bodies like water,

down to the bone like oil!

19Put it on them like a robe they have to wear all the time,

like a belt they always have on.

20Make such things Yahveh’s reward to accusers

that claim bad things about me.	Ps 109:14-20

21But Yahveh God, deal graciously with me

because your enduring love is good;

deliver me 22because I’m poor and needy

and wounded in my heart.

23I’m passing on like a lengthening shadow;

I’m brushed off like a locust.

24My knees are weak from fasting;

I’m skin and bones.

25I’m someone people scorn;

they just shake their heads at the sight of me.	Ps 109:21-25

26Help me, Yahveh my God;

in your enduring love, save me.

27Show them this is your doing.

28Let them curse, but you bless;

when they attack me, humiliate them,

and I’ll be happy.

29Dress those accusers in dishonor;

cover them with their humiliation like a cloak.	Ps 109:26-29

30I’ll praise Yahveh repeatedly;

I’ll praise him in front of everyone,

31because he stands by the needy

to save them from those who condemn them to death.

Ps 109:30-31

Psalm 110

A Psalm of David

1Yahveh said to my Lord,

“Sit at my right hand

till I make your enemies your footstool.”

2Yahveh will extend your mighty scepter from on Zion,

and say, “Rule your enemies.”

3Your soldiers will volunteer readily

when you muster your army in holy array;

your strength will be renewed

every morning like the dew.

4Yahveh has sworn and won’t change his mind,

“You’re a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”

5Yahveh is at your right hand

to shatter kings when it’s time to display his anger.

6He’ll render judgment against the nations by filling them with corpses;

he’ll shatter leaders worldwide.

7He’ll refresh himself from streams along the way

and raise up his head in triumph.	Ps 110-:1-7

Psalm 111

1Hallelujah!

I thank Yahveh with all my heart

in the presence of his godly people.

2His works are so outstanding

no one that delights in them

can quit thinking about them;

3their splendor and majesty

reflect his eternal goodness;

4he makes his amazing acts memorable

because they show his grace and mercy.

5He feeds those who respect him

and remembers his covenant with them;

6he demonstrated his power to his people

by giving them other nations’ land.	Ps 111:1-6

7His works are just and true;

so his people can trust his commandments

8to bring eternal security

when they practice them sincerely.

9He has provided redemption for his people

and ordained his covenant with them forever;

he’s holy and awesome.

10Respecting Yahveh is the most important thing about being wise;

doing what he commands brings understanding.

Praise him forever.	Ps 111:7-10

Psalm 112

1Hallelujah!

How blessed people are that respect Yahveh

and delight in what he calls on them to do.

2Their descendants will be successful

and a blessing to their own generation.

3They’ll have wealth and riches in their homes,

and their goodness will last forever.

4Godly people have light in the dark;

they’re gracious, merciful, and good.

5Goodness comes to those who graciously lend

and conduct their affairs with justice.

6Misfortune won’t overcome them,

and people will remember the good they’ve done. 	Ps 112:1-6

7Bad news doesn’t scare people like that

because they’ve committed themselves to Yahveh they trust;

8they’re confident and courageous

and face their adversaries with assurance.

9They give freely to the poor,

so their goodness lasts forever

in ongoing influence and honor.

10Sinners will see that and get mad;

they’ll grit their teeth—and leave;

what they wanted won’t happen.	Ps 112:7-10

Psalm 113

1Hallelujah!

Servants of Yahveh, praise him;

2bless him from now on forever;

3from sunrise to sunset, praise him.

4On high above the nations,

he displays his glory in the sky.

5Who is like Yahveh our God

that sits on high, 6but humbles himself to watch

what’s happening in the sky and on earth?

7Then he raises up the poor from the dust

and lifts the needy from the ash pile

8to seat them beside the princes of his people.

9He gives the barren woman a home

like a happy mother of children.

Hallelujah! 	Ps 113:1-9

Psalm 114

1When Israel left Egypt—

when the House of Jacob came out

from a nation with a different language—

2the land of Judah became his sanctuary;

Israel became his kingdom.

3The Red Sea saw them coming and backed away;

the Jordan quit flowing.

4The mountains jumped like rams;

the hills skipped around like lambs.

5What’s the matter with you, Sea, that you’re backing away,

or Jordan, that you’ve quit flowing,

6or mountains, that you jump like rams,

or hills, that you skip around like lambs?

7Earth, tremble at the Lord, Jacob’s God,

8who turned rock into water

and flint into a fountain.	Ps 114:1-8

Psalm 115

1Not to us, Yahveh, not to us,

but to you be honor

because of your enduring love and faithfulness.

2Why should the nations say,

“Where’s their God?”

3Our God is in heaven,

where he accomplishes what he intends.

4Their man-made idols are just silver and gold

5with mouths that can’t talk,

eyes that can’t see,

6ears that can’t hear,

noses that can’t smell,

7hands that can’t feel,

feet that can’t walk,

throats that can’t make a sound!

8The ones that make them will become like them,

likewise everybody that relies on them.	Ps 115:1-8

1Not to us, Yahveh, not to us,

but to you be honor

because of your enduring love and faithfulness.

2Why should the nations say,

“Where’s their God?”

3Our God is in heaven,

where he accomplishes what he intends.

4Their man-made idols are just silver and gold

5with mouths that can’t talk,

eyes that can’t see,

6ears that can’t hear,

noses that can’t smell,

7hands that can’t feel,

feet that can’t walk,

throats that can’t make a sound!

8The ones that make them will become like them,

likewise everybody that relies on them.	Ps 115:1-8

9Israel, trust in Yahveh;

he’s your helper and shield.

10House of Aaron, trust in Yahveh;

he’s your helper and shield.

11All of you that respect Yahveh, trust in him;

he’s your helper and shield.

12He cares about you; he’ll bless you;

Israel and Aaron;

13he’ll bless everyone that respects him,

least and greatest.

14May he increase you and your children;

15may the Maker of earth and sky bless you.	Ps 115:9-15

16The sky belongs to him,

but he’s given us the earth.

17The dead don’t praise Yahveh;

nobody does that descends into silence;

18but we’ll bless him

from now on forever.

Hallelujah!	Ps 115:16-18

Psalm 116

1I love Yahveh because he listens to my petitions;

2so I’ll call on him as long as I live.

3The snares of death were all around me;

the pains of Sheol came on me;

I suffered distress and sorrow.

4Then I called on Yahveh,

“Please save me.”	Ps 116:1-4

5YouY are gracious and good, merciful God.

6You preserve the simple;

when I was brought low, you saved me.

7I can rest again

because you’ve been good to me;

8you’ve saved me from death,

my eyes from tears,

my feet from stumbling.

9I’ll walk with you in the land of the living.

10I kept believing even when I said,

“I’m greatly oppressed.”

11I said in my anxiety,

“Everybody’s lying to me!”	Ps 116:5-11

12How can I repay you, Yahveh,

for all your benefits?

13I’ll lift up the cup of salvation

and call on you.

14I’ll fulfill my vows to you

in the presence of your people.

15You care about your holy people when they die.

16Yahveh, I’m your servant,

the son of your maidservant;

you’ve removed my shackles.

17I’ll offer you a thanksgiving sacrifice

and call on you.

18I’ll fulfill my vows to you

in the presence of your people,

19in the courts of your Temple in Jerusalem.

Hallelujah! 	Ps 116:18-19

Psalm 117

1Praise Yahveh, every nation;

praise him, every people group,

2because he has great enduring love toward us.

HisY faithfulness lasts forever.

Hallelujah!	Ps 117:1-2

Psalm 118

1Be grateful to Yahveh because he’s good;

his love lasts forever.

2Let Israel say,

“His love lasts forever.”

3Let the house of Aaron house say,

“His love lasts forever.”

4Let those that respect Yahveh say,

“His love lasts forever.”	Ps 118:1-4

5I called on Yahveh in my distress;

he answered me and set me free.

6HeY is on my side; so I won’t be afraid;

what can mortals do to me?

7He’s beside me to help me;

so I’ll look in triumph at those who hate me.

8It’s better to take refuge in Yahveh than trust in people,

9to take refuge in him than put trust in rulers.	Ps 118:5-9

10All the nations surrounded me;

in Yahveh’s name I destroyed them.

11They surrounded me on every side;

in Yahveh’s name I destroyed them.

12They swarmed around me like bees;

they stung like burning thorns;

in Yahveh’s name I destroyed them.

13They shoved me back so hard I started to fall,

but Yahveh came to my aid.

14He’s my strength and song;

he’s my salvation.	Ps 118:10-14

15Joyful shouting over deliverance

goes on in the tents of good people;

Yahveh’s right hand has done valiantly.

16HeY has lifted high his right hand;

hisY right hand has done mighty things.

17I’ll live to tell what he’s done.

18He disciplined me severely,

but he didn’t let me die.	Ps 118:15-18

19Open the gate to goodness for me

so I can go in and thank Yahveh.

20This is his gate;

good people enter through it.

21Thank you for answering me;

you’ve become my salvation.	Ps 118:19-21

22The stone the builders rejected

has become the cornerstone.

23That’s Yahveh’s doing;

it’s amazing to us.

24Today is a day Yahveh has made;

let’s celebrate and be happy in it.

25Yahveh, save us

and send us prosperity.

26Blessed is the one that comes in Yahveh’s name;

we bless you from hisY Temple.

27Yahveh is God; he gives us light;

tie the festival sacrifice to the horns of the altar.

28You’re my God; I thank you;

you’re my God; I praise you.

29Give thanks to Yahveh because he’s good;

his love lasts forever. 	Ps 118:22-29

Psalm 119

Aleph א

1How blessed they are who follow his way blamelessly,

who follow the Law of Yahveh,

2who observe his testimonies

and look to him with all their heart.

3They do no evil who follow his ways.

4You’ve charged us

to keep your commandments diligently.

5Oh that my ways may become secure

by reflecting on your statutes!

6I won’t be disgraced

if I keep my eye on everything you’ve commanded.

7I’ll thank you by living with a godly heart

as I learn your good ordinances.

8I’ll keep your statutes;

don’t give up on me!	Ps 119:1-8

Bet ב

9How can the young keep their conduct pure?

By guarding it with what you say.

10I’ve looked to you wholeheartedly;

don’t let me stray from your commandments.

11I’ve treasured up your word in my heart

so I won’t sin against you.

12You’re blessed, Yahveh;

teach me your statutes.

13I’ve recited all the ordinances you’ve given

14and delighted in your testimonies as much as in wealth.

15I’ll study your precepts

and fix my attention on your ways.

16I’ll delight in your decrees

and commit your word to memory.	Ps 119:9-16

Gimel ג

17Deal well with me

so I can live and keep your word.

18Open my eyes so I can see

the wonderful things in your Law.

19I’m a foreigner in the world;

so make your commandments clear to me.

20I feel a burden

to always keep your ordinances.

21You rebuke the insolent, the accursed

that wander off from your commandments.

22Take their insults and contempt away from me

because I observe your decrees.

23Even though officials sit around plotting against me,

I still think about your statutes

24and delight in your decrees;

they’re my counselors.	Ps 119:17-24

Dalet ד

25I’m lying in the dust;

revive me with your message.

26I’ve told you my intentions and you responded;

now teach me your statutes!

27Make me understand what your commandments mean

so I can think about your wonderful deeds.

28I melt away with sorrow;

encourage me with your message.

29Put false ways far away from me

and graciously teach me your Law.

30I’ve chosen to be faithful

and keep your ordinances at hand.

31I hold onto your testimonies, Yahveh;

don’t let me feel humiliated!

32I’ll follow your commands

because by them you increase my understanding.	Ps 119:25-32

He ה

33Teach me, Yahveh, the way your statutes direct,

and I’ll keep them to the end.

34Help me understand

so I can observe your Law properly.

35Lead me the way your commandments dictate

because I delight in them.

36Incline my heart to your testimonies

rather than to dishonest profit.

37Turn my attention away from pointless things

and give me life in your ways.

38Confirm to me your servant your promise

to those who respect you.

39Turn away the disgrace I dread,

because your ordinances are good.

40I want to obey your commandments;

so in your goodness give me life.	Ps 119:33-40

Vav ו

41Direct your enduring love toward me, Yahveh,

the salvation you offer in your word,

42so I can answer whoever tries to discredit me,

because I trust what you say.

43Don’t take your message out of my mouth,

because I’ve put my hope in your ordinances

44so I can keep your Law ever and always.

45I’m free because I look to your precepts.

46I’ll talk to kings about your testimonies

without feeling self-conscious.

47I delight in your commandments;

48I lift up my hands to them

and study your statutes.	Ps 119:41-48

Zayin ז

49Remember your promise

that you made for me to trust in.

50That’s my reassurance in adversity;

your promise revives me.

51Godless people utterly deride me;

yet I won’t turn aside from your Law.

52When I remember your ordinances from of old,

I find comfort.

53Burning indignation has seized me

because of sinners that abandon your Law.

54Your statutes are my songs

wherever life leads me.

55I think about you at night,

about keeping your instructions.

56This has been my way of life:

observing your commandments.	Ps 119:49-56

Het ח

57Yahveh, you’re my portion;

I promise to obey what you say.

58I ask for your blessing with all my heart;

be gracious to me like you promised.

59When I think about your ways,

I turn to your testimonies.

60I hurry to obey your commandments.

61Although sinful people’s cords ensnare me,

I won’t let them pull me away from your Law.

62At midnight I get up to thank you

for your good ordinances.

63I’m a friend to everyone that respects you

and keeps your precepts.

64The earth is full of your enduring love, Yahveh;

teach me your regulations.	Ps 119:57-64

Tet ט

65You’ve dealt well with me,

Yahveh, like you promised.

66Give me discernment and insight

because I believe in your commandments.

67Before I suffered I went astray,

but now I keep your word.

68You’re good and do good;

teach me your regulations.

69The godless have smeared me with slander;

but I’ll still observe your precepts with all my heart.

70Their hearts are dull,

but I delight in your Law.

71Suffering was good for me

because from it I learned to obey your statutes.

72Your Law is more valuable to me

than thousands of pieces of silver and gold. 	Ps 119:65-72

Yod י

73You made me and fashioned me;

help me understand so I can appreciate your commandments.

74May the ones that respect you see me and be happy

because I wait for your promise.

75Yahveh, I know your judgments are right

and that it was in your faithfulness that you oppressed me.

76Let your enduring love comfort me

like you promised.

77Send me your mercy so I can live,

because I delight in your Law.

78Discredit godless people

because they’re undermining my welfare with deceit;

meanwhile, I’ll stay focused on your precepts.

79May those who respect you return to me,

the ones that know your testimonies.

80May my heart be blameless in regard to your statutes

so I won’t have any regrets.	Ps 119:73-80

Kaph  כ

81I’m weary waiting for your rescue,

but I’ve put my hope in your message.

82My eyes strain to see your promises come true,

while I say, “When will you comfort me?”

83Though I’ve shriveled up like a wineskin in smoke,

I don’t lose touch with your regulations.

84How long will I live?

When will you punish my persecutors?

85Godless men have dug pits to capture me,

men that don’t conform to your Law.

86Your commandments are reliable;

protect me from people that harass me with lies!

87They almost ruined me,

but I didn’t give up on your precepts;

88in your enduring love, spare my life

so I can keep obeying them.	Ps 119:81-88

Lamed ל

89Yahveh, your word is settled forever in heaven.

90Your faithfulness continues through every generation;

you built the earth to stand.

91Your ordinances stand today

because everything serves your purposes.

92If the Law hadn’t delighted me,

I would’ve died in my misery.

93But I’ll never forget your instructions

because you’ve given me life by them.

94I belong to you; save me

because I’ve relied on your precepts.

95Bad people lie in ambush to destroy me,

so I’ll diligently keep thinking about your testimonies.

but your commandments don’t have any.	Ps 119:89-96

103Your words taste so sweet!

they’re sweeter than honey!

104I gain insight from your precepts;

105Your word is a lamp for my feet,

a light for my path.

give me life like you promised.

108Accept my praise

they make me happy.

112I’m determined

but I love your Law.

114You’re my shield and hiding place;

I’ve put my hope in what you say.

115Go away, bad people,

so I can observe God’s commands.

116Sustain me like you promised;

don’t let me lose hope.

117Uphold me so I’m safe,

so I can always regard your testimonies.

118You reject those who stray from your statutes

because there’re just fooling themselves.

119Sinners you consider dross,

so I love your testimonies.

120My body trembles for fear of you;

I stand in awe of your judgments.	Ps 119:113-20

121I’ve done what‘s just and true;

don’t abandon me to my oppressors.

122Be my your servant’s guarantee for good

so godless people won’t oppress me.

and your promise come true.

124Deal with me according to your enduring love

so I observe them.

light and understanding to simple people.

and your commandments are true.

Psalm 120

A Song of Ascents

1In my troubles I appealed to Yahveh,

and he answered me.

2Yahveh, rescue me from lying lips

and treacherous tongues.

3What will God do to you, treacherous tongues?

How will he intensify your punishment?

4He’ll pierce you with a soldier’s sharp arrows

and burn you with coals from a broom tree.

5Misfortune awaits me because I’m a foreigner in Meshech,

because I live among the tents of Kedar!

6For too long I’ve lived where people hate peace.

7I’m for peace; but when I speak up, they’re for war.	Ps 120:1-7

Psalm 121

A Song of Ascents

1I look up toward the mountains—

will my help come from there?

2It’ll come from Yahveh,

who made earth and sky.

3He won’t let your foot slip.

The One that guards you won’t slumber;

4he who watches over Israel never sleeps.

5Yahveh is your keeper;

he’s your protection nearby.

6The sun won’t harm you during the day

or the moon at night.

7Yahveh will protect you from harm

and keep you alive.

8He’ll guard you in everything you do

from now on forever.	Ps 121:1-8

Psalm 122

A Song of Ascents. by David

1It made me happy when they said,

“Let’s go to Yahveh’s Temple.”

2We’re standing inside your gates, Jerusalem,

3that’s built solid and seamless,

4where the tribes of Yahveh go up as required by the Law

to give him thanks;

5the thrones for judgment stand here,

the thrones of David’s dynasty.

6Pray for peace in Jerusalem:

“May they prosper who love you;

7may there be peace inside your walls

and prosperity in your palaces.”

8For the sake of my brothers and friends,

I say, “Peace be in you.”

9For the sake of the Temple of Yahveh our God,

I’ll seek the best for you.

Psalm 123

A Song of Ascents

1I look to you enthroned in heaven!

2Like a servant looks to his master

and a maid looks to her mistress,

we look to Yahveh our God,

to show us mercy.

3Be gracious to us, Yahveh,

because we’re had our fill of contempt.

4For too long our lives have been full of

the scorn of people at ease

and the contempt of arrogant others.	Ps 123:1-4

Psalm 124

A Song of Ascents. by David

1Let Israel acknowledge,

“If Yahveh hadn’t taken our side

2when people attacked us,

3they would have swallowed us alive in their fury,

4the water would have overwhelmed us,

the river would have rushed over us

5the raging water would’ve drowned us.”

6Bless Yahveh,

who didn’t let us be torn to pieces in their teeth.

7We escaped like a bird from a trapper’s snare;

the snare broke and we got away.

8Our help comes from Yahveh,

maker of earth and sky.	Ps 124:1-8

Psalm 125

A Song of Ascents

1Those who trust in Yahveh are like Mount Zion,

that can’t be moved, that lasts forever.

2Like mountains surround Jerusalem,

Yahveh surrounds his people

from now on forever.

3Sinners won’t rule

in the land allotted to good people

because they’d tempt the good to do wrong.

4Yahveh does good to those who do good,

who are godly in heart.

5But those who turn aside to their crooked ways,

he’ll lead away with sinners.

Peace to Israel!	Ps 125:1-5

Psalm 126

A Song of Ascents

1When Yahveh brought us exiles back to Zion,

we were like people dreaming.

2Our mouths were laughing,

our tongues were shouting with joy;

the other nations were saying of us,

“Yahveh has done great things for them.”

3Yes, Yahveh has done great things for us;

we’re happy.

4Restore our fortunes, Yahveh,

like streams in the Negev.

5Those who sow in tears will reap with joy.

6Those who go back and forth weeping with their bags of seed,

will come again with shouts of joy, bringing bundles of grain.

Ps 126:1-6

Psalm 127

A Song of Ascents, by Solomon

1Unless Yahveh builds the house,

they work for nothing who build it;

unless Yahveh guards the city,

its watchmen stay awake for no reason.

2In vain you rise early and work late

to eat the food you gain by painful labor;

he gives rest to the ones he loves.

3Children are a gift from Yahveh;

what the womb produces is a reward.

4Children born to a young man are

like arrows in a soldier’s hand.

5How blessed he is that has a quiver full of them;

he won’t be disgraced

when he confronts his accusers at the city gate.	Ps 127:1-5

Psalm 128

A Song of Ascents

1How blessed you are that respect Yahveh

and follow his ways.

2When you eat what you earn,

you’ll be happy, and life will be good.

3Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in your house;

your children will be like olive plants around your table.

4That’s how you’re blessed who respect Yahveh.

5Yahveh bless you from Zion;

may you see Jerusalem prosper all your whole life.

6May you live to see your grandchildren.

Peace to Israel!	Ps 128:1-6

Psalm 129

A Song of Ascents

1Let Israel say,

2“They’ve persecuted me often since I was young,

but they haven’t defeated me.

3My back looks like a farmer plowed it

and made long furrows.”

4Yahveh is good;

he has cut loose from me the cords of the wicked.

5May everyone that hates Zion

be driven away and discredited.

6Let them be like grass on a rooftop

that withers before it’s grown.

7The reaper doesn’t fill his hand with it,

or the bundler fill his arms.

8People that go past don’t say,

“Yahveh bless you;

we bless you in his name.”	Ps 129:1-8

Psalm 130

A Song of Ascents

1Yahveh, I’ve cried out to you from the depths;

2be attentive to my petitions.

3If you kept track of sins, who could stand?

4But you forgive so people can continue to respect you.

5I wait for Yahveh

and put my hope in what he says.

6I wait for the Lord

more than watchmen hope for morning.

7Israel, put your hope in Yahveh

because there’s enduring love

and abundant redemption in him.

8He’ll redeem Israel from its sins.	Ps 130:1-8

Psalm 131

A Song of Ascents, by David

1Yahveh, my heart’s not proud or my eyes arrogant;

I don’t insert myself into things I can’t handle.

2I’ve calmed and quieted myself;

like a weaned child resting against its mother,

my soul is quiet within me.

3Israel, put your hope in Yahveh

from now on forever.	Ps 131:1-3

Psalm 132

A Song of Ascents

1Yahveh, remember David and what he suffered;

2how he swore to Yahveh

and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

3“I won’t go to my own house

or get on my bed 4and sleep

5till I find a place for Yahveh to live,

a place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”	Ps 132:1-5

6We heard it in Ephrathah

and found it in the fields of Jaar,

7“Let’s go to his Temple

and worship at his footstool.”

8Come to your resting place, Yahveh,

you and the ark that represents your strength.

9May your priests be arrayed in goodness,

and your holy people sing for joy.

10For the sake of David your servant,

don’t turn away from your anointed one.

11You’ve sworn to him

a truth you won’t take back:

“I’ll set a son from your body on your throne.

12If your descendants keep my covenant

and the Testimony I teach them,

their descendants will also sit

on your throne permanently.” 	Ps 132:6-12

13You’ve chosen Zion;

you wanted to live there:

14“This is my permanent resting place;

I’ll live here because I’ve wanted it.

15I’ll abundantly bless what it can provide

and satisfy its needy ones with food.

16I’ll dress its priests in deliverance;

its holy people will sing for joy.

17I’ll make a horn from David spring up there

and light a lamp for my anointed one.

18I’ll dress his enemies in humiliation

but make his crown shine.”	Ps 132:13-18

Psalm 133

A Song of Ascents. by David

1It’s so good and pleasant

for brothers to live together in peace.

2It’s like precious anointing oil

running down like it did on Aaron’s beard

and dripped on his robe.

3It’s like the dew from Mount Hermon

that falls on the hills around Mount Zion;

Yahveh commanded the blessing there—eternal life.	Ps 133:1-3

Psalm 134

A Song of Ascents

1Bless Yahveh, you servants of Yahveh

that serve at night in his Temple!

2Raise your hands toward the sanctuary

and bless him.

3May the One that made earth and sky

bless you from Zion.	Ps 134:1-3

Psalm 135

1Hallelujah!

Praise Yahveh;

praise him, his servant,

2you that stand in his Temple,

in the courts of our God!

3Praise him because he’s good;

sing his praises because he’s gracious,

4because he’s chosen Jacob for himself,

Israel for his own possession.	Ps 135:1-4

5I know Yahveh is great,

that he’s above all gods.

6He does what he wants

in the sky, on earth, in the seas and all their depths.

7He makes clouds come up from the horizon;

he sends lightning with the rain

and brings the wind out of his storehouses.	Ps 135:5-7

8He struck Egypt’s firstborn,

people and animals.

9He performed signs and wonders

on Pharaoh and his people.

10He struck many nations

and slew powerful kings:

11Sihon, king of the Amorites;

Og, king of Bashan;

as well as the kingdoms in Canaan.

12He gave their land as an inheritance

to his people Israel.

13His name lasts forever;

his renown endures throughout all generations.

14Yahveh will vindicate his people

and have mercy on his servants. 	Ps 135:8-14

15The hand-crafted idols the nations have are just silver and gold

16with mouths that can’t talk,

with eyes that can’t see,

17with ears that can’t hear;

and they can’t breathe.

18The ones that make them are just like them,

everybody that trusts in them too.	Ps 135:15-18

19House of Israel, bless Yahveh;

House of Aaron, bless Yahveh;

20House of Levi, bless Yahveh;

you that respect Yahveh, bless him.

21From Zion bless Yahveh,

who lives in Jerusalem.

Hallelujah!	Ps 135:19-21

His love is everlasting.

5to him that made the sky in his wisdom,

His love is everlasting.

6to him that spread out the dry land higher than the water,

His love is everlasting.

His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:1-9

10to him that struck the Egyptians and their firstborn

His love is everlasting;

11and brought Israel out of there

His love is everlasting,

12with a strong hand and outstretched arm;

His love is everlasting,

13to him that separated the Red Sea

His love is everlasting.

14and passed Israel through it,

His love is everlasting;

15but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in it;

His love is everlasting;	Ps 136:10-15

16to him that led his people through the desert,

His love is everlasting;

17to him that struck great kings

His love is everlasting;

18and slew them:

His love is everlasting.

19Sihon, king of the Amorites,

His love is everlasting,

20and Og, king of Bashan;

His love is everlasting;

21and gave their land as an inheritance,

His love is everlasting,

22an inheritance for Israel his servant,

His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:16-22

23who remembered us in our low estate

His love is everlasting;

24and rescued us from our enemies,

His love is everlasting,

25who gives good to every person.

His love is everlasting.

26Thank God in heaven.

His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:23-26

Psalm 137

1We sat by the rivers in Babylon

and cried when we remembered Zion.

2We hung our harps on its willows.

3Our captors required us to sing there;

our tormentors demanded happy songs,

“Sing us a song from Zion.”	Ps 137:1-3

4How can we sing about Yahveh in a foreign land?

5If I forget you, Jerusalem,

may my right hand wither.

6May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth

if I don’t remember you,

if I don’t regard Jerusalem

above my greatest joy.

7Remember, Yahveh, against the Edomites

the day of Jerusalem, when they said to the Babylonians,

“Tear it down, tear it down to its foundation.”

8Young woman of Babylon, you devastated one,

how happy will be the one that repays you

with what you did to us.

9How happy will the one be that grabs your infants

and dashes them against the rocks!	Ps 137:4-9

Psalm 138

A Psalm of David

1I thank you with all my heart

and sing your praises in front of the mighty.

2I bow toward your holy Temple

and thank you for your enduring love and faithfulness,

because you’ve guaranteed your promises

with the honor your name has.

3You answered me when I called out to you

and made me bold with strength.	Ps 138:1-3

4Kings will thank you, Yahveh,

when they hear what you say.

5They’ll sing about your ways

because your honor is so great.

6Though you’re high above us,

you care about the lowly;

but you recognize the proud from a long way off.

7Though I’m in trouble, you’ll protect me

and reach out against my enemies to save me.

8You’ll accomplish the purposes you have for me;

your love endures forever, Yahveh.

Don’t abandon the ones you’ve created.	Ps 138:4-8

Psalm 139

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1Yahveh, you’ve known me and examined me.

2You know when I sit down and when I get up;

from a long way off you know what I’m thinking.

3You search out my traveling and my resting;

you’re well acquainted with my ways.

4Before I speak,

you know what I’m going to say.

5You’ve protected me front and back

and laid your hand over me.

6Knowledge like that is too amazing for me;

it’s beyond me; I can’t imagine it.	Ps 139:1-6

7Where can I go from your Spirit?

Where can I go to get away from you?

8If I go up to the sky, you’re there;

if I make my bed in Sheol, you’re there.

9If I take the wings of morning

and live by the most distant part of the ocean,

10even there you’ll lead me and support me.

11If I say, “Let darkness cover me,

and the light around me become night,”

12the dark’s not dark to you;

the night’s as bright as day.	Ps 139:7-12

13You formed my inner parts

and knit me together in my mother’s womb.

14Thank you; the way you’ve made me

is awesome and wonderful.

What you do is marvelous;

I know that for sure.

15My frame wasn’t hidden from you

when I was being made in secret,

intricately put together deep in the earth.

16You saw my unshaped substance;

you wrote in your scroll

the length of life you appointed for me

before there was any of it.	Ps 139:13-16

17How precious your thoughts are to me!

How vast their number is!

18If I could count them, they’d outnumber the grains of sand.

When I wake up, I’m still with you.

19Oh that you’d slay the sinful, God.

(Go away from me, you murderers!)

20Your enemies say awful things about you;

they use your name as a byword.

21Don’t I hate those who hate you?

Don’t I despise the ones that oppose you?

22I have total disdain for them;

they’re my enemies.

23Examine me, God, and know my heart;

test me and see how anxious my thoughts are.

24See if there’s anything offensive in me

and lead me in the everlasting way.	Ps 139:17-24

Psalm 140

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1Yahveh, rescue me from sinful people

protect me from those who are violent,

2that plot evil things in their minds,

and constantly stir up conflict.

3They have pointed tongues like a snake;

viper’s venom lies behind their lips.

4Yahveh, protect me from sinful people;

Protect me from those who are violent,

that try to trip me.

5The arrogant hide traps for me;

with cords they spread a net beside the road

and set snares for me.	Ps 140:1-5

6I said to Yahveh, “You’re my God;

listen to my petitions.

7Yahveh the Lord, my strong deliverer,

you’ve protected my head in battle.

8Don’t let sinful people do whatever they please;

don’t further their evil intentions.

9“Make the schemes they talk about

come down on their own heads.

10Let burning coals fall on them;

throw them into the fire,

into deep pits they can’t climb out of.

11Don’t let slanderers get a foothold in the earth;

have misfortune hunt down violent people quickly.”

12I know you’ll champion the cause of the suffering

and render justice for the poor.

13The godly will thank you

and live in your presence.	Ps 140:6-13

Psalm 141

A Psalm of David

1Yahveh, I’m calling on you; come quick;

hear me out.

2Consider my prayer as incense

and the raising of my hands as an evening offering.

3Guard my mouth;

watch over my lips.

4Incline my heart away from anything evil,

from practicing sinful things with sinners.	Ps 141:1-4

5Let a godly person strike me or rebuke me graciously;

that would be ointment for my head;

Don’t let me refuse it.

I still pray constantly against the deeds of sinners.

6When their leaders are thrown over the cliffs;

they’ll learn that Yahveh’s word is true.

7“Like someone plowing up rocks,

our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”

8I look to you, Lord Yahveh,

and take refuge in you; don’t leave me with no defense.

9Keep me from the jaws of the trap they’ve set for me,

from sinners’ snares;

10may they stumble into their own nets

while I go on by safely.	Ps 141:5-10

Psalm 142

A Maskil of David when he was in the cave

A Prayer

1I cry out to Yahveh

and petition him;

2I pour out my complaint to him

and tell him my troubles.

3When I feel overwhelmed,

he knows the route I should take;

they’ve hidden traps for me

on every path I walk.

4I look in every direction,

but nobody notices me.

There’s no escape for me;

nobody cares if I live.	Ps 142:1-4

5I’m calling out to you, Yahveh;

“You’re my refuge,

my portion among the living.

6Listen to my outcry

because I’m in desperate need;

deliver me from my persecutors;

they’re just too strong.

7Bring me out of prison

so I can thank you;

the godly gather around me

because you’ve been so good to me.”	Ps 142:5-7

Psalm 143

A Psalm of David

1Hear my prayer, Yahveh;

listen to my petition;

in your faithfulness and goodness, come to my relief.

2Don’t put me on trial

because, compared to you, nobody’s good.

3My enemy has chased me,

crushed me on the ground,

and made me sit in the dark like people long dead.

4So I feel overwhelmed,

and my heart is empty.

5I remember the old days;

I ponder everything you’ve done

and think about what you’ve made.

6I reach out for you,

thirsty for you like parched ground.	Ps 143:1-6

7Answer me right away, Yahveh;

my spirit is failing; don’t hide from me,

or I’ll get like those destined for the Pit.

8Let me hear about your enduring love every morning

because I put my trust in you;

show me where to walk

because I’m lifting myself up to you.

9Deliver me from my enemies;

you’re my refuge.

10Teach me how to do your will

because you’re my God;

let your good Spirit lead me on level ground.

11In defense of your honor, Yahveh, protect me;

in your goodness, take me away from trouble;

12in your enduring love, slay my enemies;

destroy the ones that abuse me,

because I’m your servant.	Ps 143:7-12

Psalm 144

A Psalm of David

1Bless Yahveh, my Rock,

who trains my hands for war,

my fingers for battle.

2He’s my enduring love and fortress,

my stronghold and deliverer,

my shield and refuge,

who subdues nations.

3Yahveh, what are we that you give us any thought

or care about us?

4We’re like a breath;

our lifetime is like a passing shadow.	Ps 144:1-4

5Lower the sky, Yahveh, and come down;

touch the mountains and make them smoke.

6Throw your lightning bolts and scatter my enemies;

shoot your arrows and rout them.

7Reach down from on high

and rescue me from deep water,

from aliens 8that lie,

whose right hand deceives.

9I’ll sing you a new song, God;

I’ll sing praise to you on a ten-string harp.

10You deliver kings

and rescued David from the cruel sword.

11Deliver me from aliens that lie,

whose right hand deceives.	Ps 144:5-11

12Make our sons in their youth like grown-up plants

and our daughters like corner pillars in a palace.

13Fill our granaries with every kind of crop;

have our flocks bear thousands—tens of thousands—in our pastures.

14Have our cattle deliver without miscarriage or failure to bear;

make it so there’s no danger in our streets.

15How happy people are that have such blessings;

how blessed they are that have Yahveh as their God! Ps 144:12-15
