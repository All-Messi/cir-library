EVENTS AND STATEMENTS RE INTERPERSONAL PRIORITIES

The Priority of Interpersonal over Formal Matters

1. The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath (Mark 2:27; cp. Exodus 23:12d; Deuteronomy 5:14c)

2.	“Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43).  No gift for cleansing offered.  In fact, there was no provision at all in the Law for the forgiveness of murder or any capital crime.

3.	David and his men ate the showbread that was legally available only for the priests (Matthew 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5; 1 Samuel 21:6).

4.	Jesus told the woman of Sychar that salvation was in fact of the Jews, but God looks for people to worship him anywhere in spirit and truth (John 4:19-26).

5.	Hezekiah’s dealing with Passover observance by people not prepared for it after the ceremonial requirements of the Law (2 Chronicles 30:13-22)

6.	“Circumcision profits if you do the Law; if you transgress it, your circumcision is become uncircumcision.  So, if the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision? and will not the uncircumcision, which is natural, if it fulfill the Law, judge you who with the letter and circumcision transgress the Law?” (Romans 2:25-27).

7.	Micah 6:68 (cp. Deuteronomy 10:12-13) shows the priority of personal commitment and behavior over ceremonial observance of animal sacrifices.

8.	Abraham’s relationship to God preceded circumcision and the Law (Romans 4:6-15, etc.).
