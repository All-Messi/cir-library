I. A study of assurance requires an understanding of the relationship between four sets of variables:


(1)	Objective-subjective evidence. Objective refers to the real basis upon which our assurance rests; subjective refers to whether we feel assured of salvation.

(2)	Primary-confirmatory evidence. Primary evidence fits only with one conclusion; confirmatory evidence fits with the correct conclusion, but it might fit with other possibilities as well.

(3)	Absolute-relative. Absolute certainty means there is no possibility of doubt; relative certainty is the kind that is sufficient for practical purposes.

(4)	Now-later. Our assurance about our present state of salvation and our present assurance about our salvation later in life
