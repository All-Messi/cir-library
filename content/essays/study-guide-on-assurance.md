STUDY GUIDE ON ASSURANCE

I. A study of assurance requires an understanding of the relationship between four sets of variables:

(1)	Objective-subjective evidence. Objective refers to the real basis upon which our assurance rests; subjective refers to whether we feel assured of salvation.

(2)	Primary-confirmatory evidence. Primary evidence fits only with one conclusion; confirmatory evidence fits with the correct conclusion, but it might fit with other possibilities as well.

(3)	Absolute-relative. Absolute certainty means there is no possibility of doubt; relative certainty is the kind that is sufficient for practical purposes.

(4)	Now-later. Our assurance about our present state of salvation and our present assurance about our salvation later in life

Passages relative to the question of assurance are Hebrews 9:11ff; 10:1ff; 6:13-20; 2 Peter 3:9; Matthew 19:26; John 10:29; 3:16; Hebrews 10:19-22; Acts 26:19; 1 Timothy 1:13; 1 John 3:17-22; Judges 16:20; 1 Corinthians 10:22; John 16:2; Romans 10:1-2; Ezekiel 3:20; 18:24, 26; 33:12-13; Romans 11:19-22;      1 Corinthians 9:27; 10:12; Philippians 4:3; Hebrews 6:4-8; 10:26-29; 2 Peter 2:21-22; Revelation 3:5; 21:27; 22:19.

From cross references or a concordance, add to these passages other citations of similar import as well as any that add to the thought expressed in them.

(1)	Acts 17:30; Romans 2; 5:13; etc.

(2)	1 John 1:8-10; etc.

What does assurance of salvation depend on?
