margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Restrictive</u> means limited to
some portion less than all:<i> “<u>They</u> are good people” </i>(their
relatives are not good). <u>Nonrestrictive</u> means all the group—at least
generally—is characterized that way: <i>“They are good people</i> (I am not
talking about anybody else here, and, yes, I am aware of the rotter that
abandoned his family years ago).<i>”</i> Both statements indicate what the
speaker <u>means</u>, not what is true or what else he knows about other people
or about any exceptions to his point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (a)  Restrictive statements in
English are signaled by <u>stressing the word</u> that contrasts with an
alternative. Reading scripture calls for putting stress when and where contrasts
are meant and not emphasizing words where no contrast is evident. (b)
Restrictive statements in written English sometimes have special punctuation to
signal that fact. Non-restrictive adjectives and prepositional phrases are not
set off in commas, but nonrestrictive clauses have commas around them. The
point is illustrated by the difference a comma makes in the following
statement: <i>“Young people should pay attention to adults (,) who know what
young people are up against.” </i>With the comma the implication is that
adults—at least in general—know what young people are up against; so young
people should listen to them. Without the comma a young person is instructed to
pay attention to those adults that do know what young people are up against—with
the implication that some do not, so they may be disregarded at this point.</span></p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The restrictive-nonrestrictive variable
relates to the legal mindset applied to hermeneutics. This impulse in exegesis
shows up as a tendency to read statements restrictively rather than positively,
representatively, or as generalities; hence, there is a mentality of taking <u>affirmations</u>
as necessities, <u>silence</u> as prohibition, and <u>example</u> as precedent.
A statement does not necessarily exhaust all possibilities by naming the
possibilities it does name. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  People <u>read</u> statements more
restrictively than they <u>hear</u> them—probably because the spoken language
can make clearer whether a contrast is intended. Spoken language is also
delivered more quickly; so other comments can add clarification. Furthermore,
people have been poring over the biblical text for hundreds of years. Under
those conditions they look for more than they would in passing comments in
casual conversation. Reading statements as contrastive is one way of looking
for more precise information in them.</span></p>

one of these days they are going to get what is coming to them.</span></p>

says that those who believe and are baptized will be saved; but in the opposite
situation it says only that those who disbelieve will be condemned. What about unbaptized
believers, paedobaptists, or affusionists in the eyes of adult immersionists? Such
situations are foreign to the text.</span></p>

the Pharisees tell the parents of the man born blind to give glory to God
because they know Jesus was a sinner. Quite obviously, they meant <u>God</u> in
contrast to giving glory to Jesus for healing the man’s blindness. Otherwise,
they would be telling the man to be glad Jesus was a sinner!</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **In John <b>10</b>:16a
interpreters have contrasted fold and flock and applied it as a defense of
denominations. In doing so, they omit the rest of what Jesus says, <i>“I must bring
them, too, so they can become one flock.”</i> Jesus is evidently referring to
Jews and Gentiles rather than a situation not yet come.</span></p>

the laying on of the <u>apostles</u>’ [Peter and John’s] hands the Holy Spirit
was being given” (Acts<b> 8</b>:18). Does <i>apostles</i> contrast with <i>Philip</i>,
or does the statement intend no stress on <i>apostles</i>? The last verb of the
statement could be either progressive past (<i>“was being given”</i>), as
translated here, or as characteristic past (<i>“was given”</i>). The verse does
not necessarily indicate that only an apostle could “dispense” supernatural
gifts regardless of what is true about that point. “Minimum affirmation” calls
for choosing the less precise meaning (see elsewhere in these notes).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **Romans <b>1</b>:27: <i>“The
natural use of the woman”</i> means in contrast to men with men, not between
natural and unnatural (use of the woman). It is an example of a nonrestrictive
adjective, one that does not contrast. The meaning is that they have departed the
use of the woman, which is natural order, and had homosexual relations, which
is unnatural. The oral reading of the text should emphasize <i>woman</i>, not <i>natural</i>.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **Romans <b>2</b>:4: <i>“The
<u>goodness</u> of God leads you to repentance,”</i> read with the implication
that God does not bring calamities on people to foster repentance. A person
should note, however, the reason for evil in Genesis<b> 3</b> and Paul’s
comment in 2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:7-9 as well as Proverbs <b>3</b>:5ff. as
used in Hebrews <b>12</b>. The Romans passage means that we should read the
delay of judgment (cp. 2 Peter <b>3</b>) as God’s giving people a chance to
change, which illustrates goodness on his part. That is a different thing from
saying that the calamities he brings would not be examples of goodness.</span></p>

color:#7030A0'>**When Romans <b>12</b>:6-8 says, <i>“. . . prophecy, let us
prophesy according to the proportion of our faith . . .”</i> does it mean that people
should concentrate on what they are doing and not try to do everything else,
too? On the contrary, if it is a positive statement, Paul means to encourage people
to use their gift as devotedly as their faith leads them to do.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **That speaking in
languages is for a sign to unbelievers (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:22) does not
necessarily mean that is all they can be for; they might have edification value
(<b>14</b>:26) as well as evidential force that confirms faith already present.
Tongues may be primarily, particularly, distinctively for evidential purposes
without eliminating other uses as well. So, <b>14</b>:22 does not show that speakers
should use speaking in languages exclusively in evangelism rather than also in
teaching and worship.</span></p>

Philippians <b>2</b>:10-11; and Colossians <b>1</b>:19-21 intend to stress the
word <i>Christ</i> rather than <i>all</i>, because the point in each passage is
to show that in Christ—instead of in someone else—lies the salvation of all who
are saved. Otherwise, the passage becomes a text for universalism. (See <i>What
the Bible Says About Salvation</i>, pp. 119-22.)</span></p>

non-instrument issues stem from reading passages restrictively that others read
non-restrictively. Speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual
songs need not give an exhaustive, hence, restrictive list (Ephesians <b>5</b>:20-21).</span></p>

Paul tells wives to defer to their “husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.” Putting
a comma after <i>husband</i> means that submitting is the fitting thing to do. Leaving
the comma tells wives to defer in matters that are fitting to submit to in the
Lord. The contrast is with not respecting husbands in this way. On other
grounds, Christians know not to submit to anyone in doing what is wrong to do.</span></p>

color:#7030A0'>**The Second Great Commandment (Leviticus <b>19</b>:18) did not mean
<i>neighbor</i> in a restrictive fashion. (a) Luke <b>10</b>:25-37 (Parable of
the Good Samaritan) reflects the attempt to take<i> neighbor</i> in contrast to
<i>non-Jew</i>. (b) Matthew <b>5</b>:43-48 eliminates taking <i>neighbor</i> in
contrast to <i>personal enemy</i>. The stress, however, should fall on <i>love</i>
rather than on <i>neighbor</i>, so the contrast lies with <i>hate</i>
(Leviticus <b>l9</b>:17). The other person, whoever it is, is labeled
“neighbor” to reinforce a proper attitude toward other people. <i>Neighbor</i>
is used positively, not contrastively. It would not take a commandment to get
people to love those who love them; that happens automatically. <i>“Love your
friends”</i> is almost redundant. 2 Samuel <b>12</b>:11 shows that <i>neighbor</i>
does not have to mean friend: God says, <i>“I will take your wives before your
eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with them in the sight of
this sun.”</i></span></p>

for taking all third-person masculine pronouns in English as male (<i>vs</i>.
female). <i>His</i> contrasts with <i>her</i> even when no contrast is meant.
The same applies to the morpheme -<i>man</i> so that <i>chairman</i> changes to
<i>chairperson</i> (what of <i>penmanship</i> to <i>penpersonship</i>?).
Historically, <i>man</i> means “mankind” when set in opposition to God, animal,
or thing; it means male human in distinction from woman. The use of the <i>man-</i>
element in compounds has likewise carried a non-differentiating value. As in
Greek, Hebrew, Latin, <i>he</i> “took preference” in mixed or ambiguous
situations. Since English does not have a gender-neutral third singular
pronoun, the restrictive use of <i>he </i>creates awkward substitutes like “him
or her,” alternating <i>his</i> and <i>hers</i> in the same paragraph, using <i>they</i>
as singular reference, or changing the person from third to second or first.
“Inclusive language” spills over into God-references as well, a matter that
gets into theological considerations.</span></p>

Jesus loved” </i>is not restrictive in contrast to disciples Jesus did not love
or loved less. The expression may reach back into the time of Jesus’ ministry
in contrast to current leaders who had not been with Jesus. Jesus’ love may
also be what impressed him most, since he was earlier a “son of thunder” (Mark <b>3</b>:17).
The writer’s practice may be a literary device for keeping his name out of the
narrative for humility’s sake.</span></p>
