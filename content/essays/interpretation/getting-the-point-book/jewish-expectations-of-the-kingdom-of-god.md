style='font-size:12.0pt'>Introduction</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Guidelines for biblical
interpretation include the “big three”: (1) the principle of harmony, (2) the <b>principle
of contrast</b>, and (3) the nature of the case. The first derives from the
nature of <u>scripture</u>, which as a matter of principle we accept as true
throughout and therefore harmonious. The second principle derives from the
nature of <u>language</u>, which conveys ideas relative to a framework of
thought. The last principle derives from <u>experience</u>, a prime resource for
knowing the way things are. All three principles interrelate and impact the
interpretation of human language in general and scripture in particular.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Bible backgrounds provide a crucial
frame of reference for Bible study. Nowhere is this fact more important than in
relation to the second principle. The world in which Jesus and the apostles
worked had two major sets of beliefs in contrast to which they delivered their
message. One came from the Jewish setting, the other from the Gentile world. Among
<u>Jews</u> there was an established expectancy for what the Messiah and his
kingdom would be. It was a universal political kingdom geographically located,
centered in Palestine, and ruled by an eternal, political, military figure
called “Messiah.” Among <u>Gentiles</u> dualism pervaded much of the thinking. It
was a dualism between good spirit and evil matter (Gnosticism), or at least a
dualism in which the material realm was depreciated as a poor imitation of the
realm of ideas (Platonism). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In this brief sketch, we propose reading
the New Testament with these two errors constantly in mind. Quite likely the
writer was opposing one or the other when he spoke of matters they
misrepresented. The law/<b>principle of contrast</b>/negation/opposition says
that a statement is clearest when set over against its intended alternative. That
alternative relates to the writer’s frame of reference more than the reader’s. His
statements are best understood and appreciated when viewed in contrast to what
he was combating; otherwise, we may (un)consciously be supplying our own
situation and beliefs as a background to what he was saying. When we do so, we
construct a context that shapes the meaning we get from his statements. By
keeping the author’s likely alternatives in mind, we more consistently read him
on his own terms. We more clearly understand what he was saying, appreciate his
reasons for saying it, and avoid misinterpreting him. We gain <u>clarity</u>, <u>appreciation</u>,
and <u>accuracy</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  This contrasting procedure relates
to Gnostic thought. Jewish Messianic expectancies illustrate from Matthew’s
gospel the effects a contrasting method has on understanding of texts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I. The Biggest Temptation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  After Jesus’ baptism, Satan showed him
all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. The devil offered them to Jesus
if Jesus would worship him (Matthew <b>4</b>:8-10; cp. Luke <b>4</b>:5-8). This
was more than a temptation to get quick glory the easy way. It was more than a
call to relinquish authority and let Satan have it. It was a temptation to
avoid the cross. Satan was tempting Jesus to be the <u>expected</u> Messiah
rather than the <u>predicted</u> Messiah. Had he been the kind of king the Jews
anticipated and had he shown an interest in establishing the kind of kingdom
they wanted, they would have accepted him as Messiah, and there would have been
no cross. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. The
Good Confession</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the Good Confession Peter
identified Jesus as Messiah rather than prophet (Matthew <b>16</b>:13-16). The
subsequent account is sprinkled with comments whose punch comes from their
contrast to what contemporary Jewish “flesh and blood” was saying. On the truth
of what Peter had said, Jesus would build his “church,” the true assembly of
Yahveh (<i>gahal Yahveh</i>). Because of resurrection (<b>16</b>:21), not even
his own death could frustrate: <i>“the gates of the grave will not be strong
enough to resist it”</i> (<b>16</b>:18; cp. Acts <b>5</b>:35-39). By metonymy
the “grave” (not “hell”) stands for death (cp. <i>hades</i> in Acts <b>2</b>:27
from Psalm <b>16</b>:10, <i>sheol</i>; note Acts <b>13</b>:35). This result is
not particularly his conquering death for people, because he would <i>“resurrect
them in the last day.”</i> It was not specifically for stopping death’s
inability to wipe out the church through persecution or snatch his disciples
out of his hand as an indication that he was not the Messiah (John <b>10</b>:28-29;
<b>17</b>:12; <b>18</b>:9; <b>6</b>:39; cp. Romans<b> 8</b>:35-39). Rather,
death could not prevent <u>establishing</u> and “building” the church/kingdom (<b>16</b>:18
+ 19), nor discredit him as Messiah (Matthew <b>27</b>:42-43; Mark <b>15</b>:31-32;
Luke <b>23</b>:35). A dead Messiah was a virtual contradiction of terms (cp. 1
Corinthians<b> 1</b>:23, <i>etc</i>.).<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'> </span>Jesus’ speaking about his death became one of the reasons
the Jews either rejected him outright as Messiah or were greatly confused by
the idea. They believed that Messiah would <i>“abide forever”</i> (John <b>12</b>:34;
see Daniel <b>7</b>:14; Isaiah<b> 9</b>:6-7; Psalm <b>89</b>; <b>110</b>:4, <i>etc</i>.);
yet from early on Jesus predicted his execution: John<b> 3</b>:14; <b>8</b>:28;
Matthew <b>16</b>:21-28 (= Mark <b>8</b>:31-<b>9</b>:1; Luke <b>9</b>:22-27); <b>17</b>:22-23
(= Mark <b>9</b>:30-32; Luke <b>9</b>:43b-45); <b>26</b>:1-5 (= Mark <b>14</b>:1-2;
Luke <b>22</b>:1-2).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  That was a problem for more than the
general Jewish constituency. In Matthew <b>16</b>, when Jesus started
explaining to the disciples and onlookers that the Jewish leaders were going to
kill him, Peter objected. He was putting two and two together and coming up
with zero; so he tried to “correct” Jesus on that point. In Jesus’ reprimand,
he called Peter “Satan” (<b>16</b>:23) because, like Satan during the
temptation, Peter was suggesting that Jesus be a Messiah without a cross. Previously
Peter had not been reiterating the things of “flesh and blood,” but now he was representing
“people’s ides” in current Judaism (<b>16</b>:23). Satan indeed is the <i>“God/prince
of this world”</i> (2 Corinthians <b>4</b>:4; John <b>12</b>:31; <b>14</b>:30; <b>16</b>:11;
cp. <b>2</b>:2; <b>6</b>:12); so in a sense the kingdoms of the world were his
to give (Luke <b>3</b>:6). Satan is always willing to offer a lesser good in
place of the necessary good. Unwittingly Peter was proposing that same
compromise, which would have made Jesus less than the righteous ideal the
Father wanted as the basis for saving people from unrighteousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Not only would Jesus bear a cross,
but his followers would be called on to do the same. What good does it do even
to gain all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and lose his “identity”
in the process (<b>16</b>:26; cp. Hebrews<b> 12</b>:14-17)? That is bad enough
as a concern for any of us. If we lose who we are, what do we have left? What
can we gain to replace it? Why be? If <u>Jesus</u> had accepted the offer to
keep his life, he would have been exchanging who he was for who he was not. He
would have been a non-Messiah—an existing no one, a meaningless and powerless
name. Existing was not the point. Accepting the offer to live would have meant
becoming what the “offerers” had in mind; <u>they</u> would have been in
charge; he would have been serving <u>their</u> purposes. Even his living would
have been reduced to “existing,” because he would have forfeited the quality of
existing called “life.” What was true for him holds for his disciples as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  At their current level of
understanding, the Twelve were in no position to tell anyone that Jesus was the
Messiah (<b>16</b>:20). They would have been telling the masses what the masses
expected to hear. Besides, if they now announced in no uncertain terms that Jesus
was the Messiah—even without a false explanation, the Jews would have jumped to
their own conclusions and the whole country would have gone into a frenzy
before Jesus had time to re-educate at least some of them into a new way of
thinking about the Messiah and his kingdom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. The
Great Commission</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the first gospel, Jesus’ final
words commissioned the Eleven to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the
name of the Father-Son-Spirit, teaching them to observe everything he had
commanded them; and he would be with them till the end of the age (Matthew <b>28</b>:19-20).
The methods for extending the kingdom correspond with the nature of the kingdom
they extend. A political kingdom extends itself through military warfare.
Accordingly, the Jews expected Messiah to be a military figure. They were
concerned first that he throw off the current yoke of foreign domination and
then lead them into conquering the other nations. Jews would rule the world and
would impress the worship of Yahveh on all their subjects. Messiah would be the
eternal ruler of that universal domain. What they envisioned for the whole
earth under Messiah resembled the original conquest of Canaan under Joshua—extended
from Canaan to the ends of the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Unless we see the Great Commission
in contrast to the expectancies of contemporary Judaism, we fail to see how revolutionary
it was. We need to see the difference between the commission through Moses and
the commission through Messiah. The latter is intentionally non-militaristic. It
is a <b>“kingdom” spread by <u>influence</u></b> rather than <u>force</u>. Its
mission is an “educational” enterprise that deals with relationships, ideas,
beliefs, and resulting behaviors communicated in words and demonstrated in the
spokesmen: <i>“teach them everything I taught <u>you</u>.”</i> It calls for
conversion, not compliance. It preserves the integrity of persons in contrast
to what happens with the use of physical force, legislative compulsion, social
pressure, economic sanctions, or emotional manipulation. Therefore, it is not
carried out by a church-state union, demands-making demonstrations, or
high-pressure salesmanship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Although the end does not justify
the means, it does determine what means could be used. Interpersonal results come
from interpersonal causes. As one final object lesson to stress the
interpersonal manner of <u>extending</u> this kingdom, Jesus had the disciples
take along a couple swords to Gethsemane (Luke <b>22</b>:35-39, 49-51; Matthew <b>26</b>:51-54;
Mark <b>14</b>:46-47; John <b>18</b>:10-11). Before, he had forbidden swords in
the mission of the Twelve and the seventy (Matthew<b> 6</b>:9-10; Mark <b>6</b>:8-9;
Luke <b>9</b>:3 and Luke <b>10</b>:4 + <b>22</b>:36). Having the swords in
Gethsemane set things up for Jesus to have Peter put his sword away and to say
with credibility to Pilate later, <i>“My kingdom is not of this world . . .
otherwise, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being delivered to the
Jews”</i> (John <b>18</b>:36). The kingdom of God does not establish itself by
using the mechanisms of liberation theology. The methods correspond to the objects
they are used to accomplish like the “law of the harvest” dictates. Means fits
ends.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Christian mission deals with <b>interpersonal
identity</b>, not physical identity: <i>“baptizing them into the <u>name</u>”</i>
in contrast to circumcising them into a nation. There is no concern for <i>“glorying
in someone’s flesh”</i> because they are of the same race or nationality
(Galatians <b>6</b>:13). Being a descendant of Abraham does not count anymore
(Matthew<b> 3</b>:9). In fact, Jews themselves needed to be saved into this
kingdom as Pentecost and following shows, so it was not a kingdom comprised of
everyone in one nation: <i>“They are not all Israel that are of Israel”</i>
(Romans <b>9</b>:6). Neither was the Messianic kingdom just for people in the one
nation Israel; the people brought into it stayed in their nation of origin: <i>“in
every nation the one that fears [God] and works righteousness is acceptable to
him”</i> (Acts <b>10</b>:35). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In contrast to, say, Islamic
mission, the great commission produces a <b>transcultural kingdom</b>: <i>“all
the nations (as nations).”</i> In every nation, anyone that fears God is
acceptable <u>as is</u>. They do not have to renounce their present citizenship
or assume dual citizenship. When they become Christians, they do not get
renamed or start wearing a certain culture’s clothes or begin eating different
foods or learning to speak another language. The concern is not to begin
observing the customs that Moses delivered, because the kingdom is not culture
bound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The Messianic commission has a <b>non-territorial
locus</b>. Acts and the epistles show that the spread of the kingdom was among
some individuals in every place: <i>“they who believe”</i> (Mark <b>16</b>:16).
It is simply a matter of “faith,” one of the code words connected with the interpersonal
realm. Christian “crusades” do not concern themselves with winning back
“Christian territories” from other state religions. The commission is not to conquer
territory, but to “conquer” hearts and minds. The kingdom of God is not here or
there; it is “within you,” “among you,” interpersonal (Luke <b>17</b>:20-21;
John<b> 4</b>:20-21).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  </span></b><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>Messiah’s presence with his people is an <b>interpersonal presence</b>
more than a physical one: <i>“Go”</i> + <i>“I will be <u>with</u> you”</i> +
his ascension. That kind of presence does not require physical proximity. He is
not a visible general in front of a visible army bringing in a kingdom <i>“that
comes with observation”</i> (Luke<b> 17</b>:20). The Messianic kingdom itself
cannot even be seen except with transcendent—that is, interpersonal—eyes (John<b>
3</b>:3). Its citizens must adopt a whole new orientation even to get into it—an
experience called being born again-from-above. Messiah is not a king on a
tangible throne in an earthly Jerusalem that can be shaken (Hebrews <b>12</b>:22-29).
His is a heavenly throne (Colossians <b>3</b>:1-3; Revelation <b>4</b>) and ours
a heavenly citizenship (Philippians <b>3</b>:20). He is a king with spiritual
power, a resurrected Lord that has ascended to the right hand of the Father. His
is a presence he can promise the apostles in the very context of leaving them;
hence, it is an interpersonal presence. It leads to an empowerment that can be
produced by “spiritual presence” (cp. 1 Corinthians<b> 5</b>:3-4), the
interpersonal power of interpersonal presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Reading a book “on its own terms”
means reading it first in reference to the issues its <u>author</u> is
concerned to affirm, deny (exegesis), or elaborate rather than reading it
relative to issues <u>we</u> readers bring to it for answers (eisegesis). Reading
it on its own terms means reading in a way that harmonizes with the rest of
what its author affirms and reading it in contrast to what he opposes. The
negation principle used in the procedure demonstrated here sometimes <b>(a)</b>
leads to new understandings, but its main values lie elsewhere. The principle
of contrast <b>(b)</b> highlights the text and enriches it with relevance. It
shows <u>why</u> something was said and suggests why certain events were chosen
for the record when there were so many other things that surely could have been
recorded (John <b>20</b>:30; <b>21</b>:35). Most importantly, the principle of contrast
<b>(c)</b> helps us more accurately generalize principles to present-day
situations that differ from the original ones. Misapplication can otherwise
happen because speakers and writers structure their comments to be clear in
reference to what they are correcting. Their words may not be clear in relation
to other contrasts because they were not guarding against being misunderstood
on topics foreign to their frame of reference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We encourage students of the New
Testament to read it particularly in contrast to prevailing beliefs of the first
century. <u>The first contrast</u> is with the Jewish belief in a political
Messiah sets the primary alternative to the nature of the “kingdom” that Messiah
really came to establish. The method of contrast we applied to the temptation
account, the good confession, and the Great Commission in Matthew’s gospel
applies also to the parables of the kingdom, to many episodes throughout Jesus’
life up through the final week, the post-resurrection period, and to many
individual statements throughout the gospels, Acts, epistles, and even
Revelation. <u>The second contrast</u> is with the prevailing dualism in Greek
thought. That idea came especially in the teaching of the Gnostics that Paul
had to confront. John’s writings also have Gnostic ideas as that over against
which many comments appear. The effect gives a more concrete feel for New
Testament writings as living documents in the real world.</span></p>
