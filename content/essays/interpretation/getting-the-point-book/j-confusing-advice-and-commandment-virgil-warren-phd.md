Virgil Warren, PhD</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Commandment</u> means something
that excludes alternative behaviors. It applies to (a) <i>moral law</i>, which
goes back to first principles for determining right action. Moral law comes
from divine purpose and the nature of the case. It distinguishes between
natural and unnatural. Since moral commandments reflect purpose and the nature
of things based on purpose, people obey moral commandments to bring about a
more satisfying life. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Commandment applies to (b) <i>positive
commandment. </i>Although other possibilities exist, this one is specified—perhaps
for “good order.” Positive commandment rests more on <u>authority</u> because it
addresses appropriate and more appropriate. (The purpose of positive
commandment is nicely put by C. S. Lewis in <i>Perelandra</i>, p. 118.) It is a
commandment obeyed out of love and deference more than from necessity, fear, or
duty. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (c) God’s spokesmen may have no
clear divine guidance for proceeding, so they give<i> practical <u>advice</u></i>.
In contrast to moral law and positive commandment, advice does not eliminate
other possibilities; so doing otherwise does not constitute disobedience. Since
advice is given for practical reasons, it is “wise” to do it even though doing
otherwise might work. It is wisdom rather than law. It involves a difference
between good and better instead of good and bad. When people do not take
advice, they do not commit a sin; they take a risk. Advice and commandment
differ as to <u>intent</u>: “best do” more than “must do.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Advice and commandment differ also
as to <u>scope</u>. Advice may not be woodenly uniform for everyone,
everywhere, all the time; it is consistent with, rather than required by, purpose
and the nature of things (Proverbs <b>23</b>:31 <i>vs</i>. 1 Timothy <b>5</b>:23).
It may not be the same in every circumstance (Acts <b>15</b>:29 <i>vs</i>. 1
Corinthians <b>8</b>). Advice is a bigger category than law. Since Christianity
is an interpersonal system, advice has increased presence in the faith. That is
the reason there is a greater sense of freedom in Christ than under Moses. Under
law there is less advice and more commandment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Wisdom literature goes beyond moral matters.
It is wise counsel people do well to heed. It comes from the concern for <u>success</u>
and <u>efficiency</u>; advice is governed by <u>expediency</u> and <u>love</u>.
Many things are lawful, but not everything is expedient (1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:12;
<b>10</b>:23; cp. 2 Corinthians <b>8:</b>10; <b>12</b>:1). It may take into
consideration social and cultural expectancy. When people give advice, they use
the imperative mood with a different intent; they expect the hearer to heed at
least the “spirit” of the imperative. Advisors do not stand in an authority
relationship with those they address. Advice is a “fitting thing,” not an
inherently necessary thing. It is Ben Franklin’s “infallibly safe course.” Perceiving
what is expedient and appropriate correlates with the “gift of wisdom,” not necessarily
as a supernatural endowment but as a skill honed by Christian experience and maturity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  It may be best to let commandment
take precedence over advice in unclear cases. An item is considered commandment
unless some consideration suggests otherwise. Since advice does not follow from
first principles or the nature of things, it can apply to things apparently at
odds with other directives</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>.
Paul advised against remarriage in 1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:27 but wanted younger
widows to remarry in 1 Timothy <b>5</b>:14.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
Old Testament prophets were advisors as well as teachers and predictors. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>(See 2 Samuel <b>7</b> entry below.)</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> Advice addresses procedure rather than morality; it
is circumstantially nuanced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Advice does not controvert
inerrancy. “Inspired advice” fits with inerrancy because what the inspired
writer calls for is good—though other possibilities might also be good.
Different people might receive different instructions because they can do what
others cannot or may not have conscience or self-control to attempt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  So, the following levels of
necessity for carrying out the Christian calling under New Testament guidance: (a)
example, something done without needing to be followed by subsequent generations;
(b) precedent, something done with the intention of being followed later; (c)
advice, given out of a concern for expediency in procedural matters; (d)
positive commandment, which specifies certain ways of doing what could in
theory be handled differently (baptism, the Lord’s Supper, Old Testament
ceremonial and ritual laws); and (e) moral laws, behavioral directives that are
not situationally conditioned, because they arise from the nature of the case—divine
purpose and the nature of personal relationships.</span></p>

color:#7030A0'>**In 2 Samuel <b>7</b> Nathan told David to go ahead with building
the temple, but later he had to return and tell him that God wanted to wait and
let Solomon build it. Evidently Nathan did not speak presumptuously but considered
it a matter of procedure. The matter of having a mobile tabernacle <i>vs</i>. a
located temple was a matter of preference rather than necessity. He evidently
operated on the premise that, as court prophet, his perception of God’s general
will could serve him in specific cases.</span></p>

advises, <i>“Do not look on the wine when it is red.”</i> Paul tells Timothy to
take a little wine for his stomach’s sake (1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:23; cp. Romans <b>14</b>:21,

going to receptive fields. It is not wrong, however, to go to an unreceptive
field and labor for a lifetime. That may be the way to turn a resistant people
group into a receptive one in the long run.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **In Matthew <b>18</b>:15-17
the procedure for dealing with difficulties between Christian brothers might
have some elements of advice in it. It may not be a formula to be followed
rigidly, but an attitude toward the offender and the offended. Not taking it to
the church, for example, would not necessarily be disobedience. In regard to
the binding and loosing, perhaps it is within such procedural matters that
Jesus gave the disciples <i>“the keys to the kingdom.”</i> God promises to
stick by his people when they make decisions about how to handle certain issues
in church life and mission on which God has given no <u>revelation</u> or clear
<u>guidance</u>. In such cases believers have to do something; this promise
authorizes their use of sanctified understanding to cope with Christian life
and work. There is, then, a series comprised of three parts: seek first an
answer (a) by <u>reading scripture</u>, then (b) by <u>praying for guidance</u>,
and finally (c) by <u>using sanctified imagination</u>. (See above on 2 Samuel <b>7</b>.)</span></p>

against eating meat offered to idols in Acts <b>15</b>:29 is a matter of advice
lest more mature believers create unnecessary resistance between Gentile and
Jewish Christians in the church and between Gentile Christians and the as-yet
unbelieving Jewish community. In 1 Corinthians <b>8,</b> Paul approaches it
more leniently because he is thinking about it from the standpoint of weaker
brothers (converted from among the Gentiles) who might be tempted or misled
into eating such meat with a different intent.</span></p>
