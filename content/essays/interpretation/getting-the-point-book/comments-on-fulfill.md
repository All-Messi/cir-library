<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We may wonder what definition to put
on “fulfill” if it covers such a wide range of ideas as (1) a prediction’s
coming to pass, (2) an event that illustrates a generalized principle (Acts <b>1</b>:20?),
(3) the accomplishment of something that was also the purpose of something else
(the gospel’s fulfilling the Mosaic law: Matthew <b>5</b>:17; cp. Romans <b>3</b>:31?),
(4) an obedience that accomplished what was commanded (Romans <b>13</b>:8-10),
(5) a necessary inference from another passage, (6) a meeting of the
requirements for something (<i>“This course <u>fulfills</u> the requirement”</i>),
and (7) a mere formal similarity (? Matthew <b>2</b>:18, 23; <u>perhaps</u> <b>2</b>:15).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The question about such a wide range
of meanings is answerable from linguistic theory. In the case of words with
multiple meanings, <b>(a)</b> we <u>may</u> find a common thread of meaning
running through all its applications even if the number of applications is
considerable. “Spirit,” for example, has no less than eight or nine different
usages, but “invisible reality” seems to be a common element in them. However, <b>(b)</b>
we do not assume there is <u>a</u> common thread in the multiple meanings of
all words. To be sure, there must be some kind of historical, logical, or
formal connection between individual meanings, but that connection need not be
a common element throughout all meanings. The original meaning cluster may
involve a feature that also appears in another case and so someone begins attaching
the word to the new case. In turn, a new characteristic in the second usage may
appear in a third, to which then someone may apply the word, and so forth. This
possibility explains first why we need not find a common element in all usages
of “fulfill.” In each usage we determine what “fulfill” apparently means as
judged by context and the nature of the case. In regard to “fulfill,” however,
we may be able to identify a common thread: “answers to” is a loose enough
English expression to accommodate all seven nuances listed above.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  One added comment on #7 above. If
Matthew<b> 2</b>:23 is simply drawing attention to the interesting similarity
between (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>נַצֶר</span><span

in Isaiah <b>11</b>:1 and the terms <i>Nazareth</i>/<i>Nazarene </i>(</span><span

lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ναζωραῖος</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>,
<i>Nazaret</i>/<i>Nazōraios</i>), he is not “interpreting.” At best, Matthew is
making his own truth claim—not Isaiah’s or Zechariah’s—that Jesus is the root
of Jesse predicted by the prophet, a point Matthew makes memorable by connecting
it with the city of Messiah’s childhood. What Matthew does is like Paul’s </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>None of these are interpretative efforts. They
represent a pedagogical/rhetorical technique for making concepts memorable and
psychologically engaging. The concepts themselves are truth claims made by the
present writers, not truth claims based on the originally intended meaning of
the cited text or resident in the events or persons the writers site. They
differ little from Jesus’ parables and other graphic imagery or from Paul’s use
of our baptism in Romans <b>6</b> and Christ’s ascension in Colossians <b>3</b>
to picture transcendent living or his Olive Tree parable in Romans <b>11</b> to
encourage fruitful faithfulness. The difference is that these latter images are
created by the speaker-writer rather than lifted out of materials already
familiar to the audience. Interpretation always involves deriving intended
meaning from an author’s communication at least as a requisite part of the
larger interpretation enterprise. This is true even in “theological
interpretation,” which stresses the move from “what it meant” to “what it
means” as applied by principle in the current situation.</span></p>
