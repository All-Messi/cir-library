<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The difference between law and wisdom as
well as the relationship between them showed up in an article on the adult
offspring of divorce by Irene Sege published in the <i>Boston Globe</i> (see <i>The
Manhattan Mercury</i> for Friday, December 20, 1995, D1). Generalizations about
these young people show that their parents’ divorce measurably affects a
sizable portion of their children when they grow up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is a matter of wisdom, then, not to
enter marriage without the most earnest intentions of maintaining the future
marriage for the children’s sake—among other things. And, it is likewise a
matter of wisdom to go together into marriage with a set of values that
increases the likelihood of the marriage’s permanence. This kind of observation
is built on <u>reality</u> as based on <u>human nature</u> (<i>vs</i>. purpose
or relationship) and has the <u>pattern of tendency</u> (<i>vs</i>.
uniformity). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            When people observe this <u>tendency</u>
among young people, society may enact laws against divorce (<u>authority</u> <i>vs</i>.
nature) and against the behaviors that tend toward divorce. It enacts such laws
because <b>(1) </b>people ahead of time may not <u>understand</u>, or know
about, the effects because they are difficult to see. (a) Some children of
divorce may not exhibit the weaknesses observed in so many, which can lead a
couple to bank on the notion that the bad effects will not happen in <u>this</u>
case. (b) The effects are spread across two or three generations, and so the parents
may even deny the risk. (c) The effects may not be easy to connect with the
parents’ divorce since other plausible factors enter in as well, and these
other factors get blamed. (d) The parents’ minds are clouded by their
existential situation. People who want out of a marriage are not in the best
frame of mind to accept what they would otherwise more easily see. (e) They may
be inclined to think that negative effects on their children can be avoided by
the <u>method</u> of going about divorce or by the <u>manner</u> of treating
the kids afterward. They would rather try to do that than work at avoiding the
divorce. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the interest of avoiding the negative
effects, law comes in to <b>(2)</b> supply added <u>motivation</u> for
adherence to a pattern of living that people may not be sufficiently inclined
to observe simply from the nature of things. They may not want to change the
behaviors that are destroying the marriage and preparing to affect the kids as
it will, in fact, do. Here is a case where paternalism can come in. Paternalism
exerts itself in a situation where those responsible for the welfare of society
require citizens to do something “for their own good,” though the citizens
themselves do not believe it is for their welfare. </span></p>
