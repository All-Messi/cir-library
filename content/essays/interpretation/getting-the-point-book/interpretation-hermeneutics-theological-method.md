<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
dealing with controversial passages, interpreters make their choice by their
understanding of the big picture, the general understanding, the conceptual
context. They follow this procedure even with passages that at first glance
would call for a more likely-sounding interpretation. The readers may choose a
less likely sounding meaning because of the general understanding they bring to
the text. In such cases, where more than one reading is possible, the text
doesn’t prove either idea that the readers are bringing to it; that text rises
no higher than confirmatory evidence in contrast to primary proof. The passage
falls out of the process of arriving at the general understanding. That general
understanding must come from someplace else or from other places taken
together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
process we’re describing here shows the blending of interpretation and
theological method. In practical discussions, eliminating another viewpoint can
take the following pattern: instead of hoping to disprove the alternate idea, interpreters
eliminate it by showing with each passage used to support it has other natural
ways of being read. When this procedure is followed with each passage, that
alternative idea is at best an opinion rather than certainty. Certainty arises
from primary proof, evidence that fits with only one viewpoint</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
above observations point up several matters. One is the <u>nature of scripture</u>:
scripture throughout is operating out of the same picture of things. The method
assumes inerrancy, infallibility, accuracy, truthfulness, <i>etc</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another
consideration is <u>canonicity</u>—what writings belong to the authoritative
body of literature that supplies the ideas interpreters work with. A subset in
that matter is what books were written by Paul, for example—whether he wrote
only the basic four (Romans, 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians, Galatians) and whether the
pastorals and prison letters belong to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
third matter pertains to <u>source criticism</u>, literary criticism, and the
like. Breaking up the gospels, for example, into a set of independent sources
that were redacted by some unidentifiable person greatly reduces the context
even within a given book. The assumption is lost that these unknown writers of the
sources were operating out of the same understanding of the Christian faith. The
impact of such fragmentation is obvious, then, as with the documentary
hypothesis for the Pentateuch, in source theories for the gospels, the Book of
Acts, and the unity of other writings. At best, context and connection can be
rooted only in the perception of the redactor instead of the events themselves.
Admittedly, any writer of history does this very thing since he is not
recording everything. His choice of material and the connection between parts
of the whole flow of events that are presented is impressed on the raw data. Inspired
authorship establishes accurate connection and guarantees context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Adequate
<u>concept inventory</u> comes into the picture because an interpreter’s mind must
contain all the ideas and forms of thought that appear in the biblical content.
If they are not present in a reader’s mind, he will fudge the biblical content
into something that is similar to some idea he does have in his own mind. This
last consideration further bleeds off into an understanding of the origins of
rationality in the human brain and assumes such viewpoints as the belief that
we are born with the forms of knowledge (rationalism) while experience gives us
the content of knowledge (empiricism). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Proper
<u>thinking patterns</u> include formal and informal fallacies. Allegorizing
comparisons comes up frequently. One example is trying to show there is a
feminine aspect in God because in perhaps a dozen places scripture compares God
to a woman comforting her little one or even Jesus’ trying to gather the people
of Jerusalem under his wings like a chicken gathers her chicks (Matthew <b>23</b>:37).
In the latter case, it would be as legitimate to conclude that God has feathers
or is bipedal. The fallacy is called allegorizing the comparison, carrying the
likeness beyond the ones the author specifies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>How
language operates</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> is something intuitive in people’s minds.
Difficulty arises when the normal characteristics of language usage are not
kept the same in biblical interpretation as they are elsewhere in human
language communication. In one direction, students of scripture do not allow
language to have the flexibility, variety, and richness of usage that exists
elsewhere. For example, they tend to bring in restrictive principles of usage
like the idea that literal usage is to be assumed unless it cannot work. The
“literal” is called the “clear,” and other approaches are “twisting scripture”
to avoid its “obvious” meaning. Such an approach breaches the more fundamental
principle that authorial intent establishes what a statement means. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
the other direction, there has been an attempt to justify additional linguistic
principles like fourfold interpretation. Such ideas are rooted in the notion
that since God is using the language, he can and will do more with it than when
people use it; hence, come hidden meanings, mystical interpretation, and the
like. The problem, of course, with reducing or adding principles of
interpretation in biblical studies is that a reader loses verification and
falsification as tests for meaning. God uses human language the way we use it or
we are in no position to “get the point.” Besides, taking the biblical use of
human language out of its framework puts no limits on the ideas a “false
prophet” my claim God means by the text.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
second dimension of how language operates in interpretation concerns the differences
between one language and another. That issue comes into the picture because the
scriptures we read today were written a long time ago in other languages used
by different cultures. Furthermore, in New Testament studies, the writers of
the Greek texts had their usage of language affected by the patterns of thought
found in Hebrew. Occasionally, then, reading New Testament Greek calls for
being aware of Semitic influences together with the difficulty of expressing biblical
content in modern languages.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
above considerations illustrate the connections between a wide range of disciplines
in biblical study. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
truth itself is <i>“simple so that a wayfaring fool need not err therein” </i>(Isaiah
<b>35</b>:8) The difficulties come in getting to that truth and distinguishing
it from other ideas that might look like it. The most basic principle again is identifying
the author’s intention: “authorial intent.” We look for features of the near
and distant contexts of what the writer says so we can judge how literally or
figuratively he means to speak. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We
do not start with a false principle like taking the literal over the figurative
whenever possible. Jesus claimed that he would destroy the temple and rebuild
it in three days (Matthew <b>26</b>:61; Mark <b>14</b>:58; John<b> 2</b>:19-22).
His listeners mistook him as speaking literally when he meant it figuratively
regarding his own body, which would be crucified and resurrected as a replacement
for the temple as a place for sacrifice. The religious leaders used it as an
accusation for condemning him to crucifixion (Matthew <b>27</b>:40; Mark <b>15</b>:29).
A similar misinterpretation occurs in Matthew <b>16</b>:6-12 about <i>“the leaven
of the Pharisees”</i> and in the blind man’s <i>“being born in sin”</i> (John <b>9</b>:34
&lt; Psalm <b>51</b>:5). Nicodemus likewise mistook <i>“born again” </i>as if meant
literally (John <b>3</b>:3-13).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Likewise,
we cannot rely on finding another passage that eliminates an incorrect reading
of this one. While that sometimes happen, the procedure often calls for a more
involved effort of thought and research—efforts such as those indicated above.</span></p>
