style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A word, phrase, or general
presentation does not mean whatever the expressions could mean; it means what
fits the immediate flow of thought, the distant context, and the nature of the
case. Readers need to look for the relevant contrast over against which the writer
is speaking. They need to properly identify the topic an author is speaking
about. They must transcend their existential situation and personality bent
lest they put biblical statements in a foreign framework; otherwise, the
dogmatic and practical principles get ahead of the exegetical one (see entries
above). Readers have to read the biblical writer “on his own terms”; they have
to “get inside the writer’s mind.”</span></p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Whether a passage can be applied
beyond its intended reference depends on the nature of the case and how someone
applies it. In any case, we must be careful with inferences. Certain larger
contexts may bring features into the picture that are alien to the issue. Authors
do not necessarily guard their statements with disclaimers against every conceivable
misunderstanding on unaddressed topics. It is precarious to attempt to answer
questions from biblical statements that do not address those questions. When people
speak, they try to word their thoughts so as not to confuse their hearers about
relevant issues; but they cannot guard against every misunderstanding on other
topics. </span></p>

prohibits murder. It belongs in a social setting, not a political, martial, or
legal one. It does not require <u>pacifism</u> by prohibiting war, police
action, or self-defense since the Torah enjoined capital punishment elsewhere
and God sanctioned warfare for Israel’s self-protection and overthrown of the
Canaanite inhabitants of Palestine. The sixth commandment does not require <u>vegetarianism</u>
since dietary laws specified what animals could be eaten when they speak of
clean and unclean meats. It obviously does not prohibit eating vegetables;
otherwise, people could not stay alive at all. The ultimate ethical principle
is not “reverence for life.”</span></p>

Christians today—in “this place” at least—can perform such miracles, it does no
good to claim that they ought to be happening.</span></p>

of the corruption that occurred with King David.</span></p>

Paul says that sin entered the world through one man and death entered through

make it say that the death phenomenon as such entered through human sin. So, no

the necessary view.</span></p>

is said in connection with salvation. What is true soteriologically does not set
the full pattern for Christian living; hence, there is no contradiction between
<i>“no male or female”</i> and designated role emphasis. Paul does not deny
male-female distinctions physically and psychologically so as to approve of
homosexual behavior or homosexual marriage.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **In 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34-35
Paul says that women should keep silent in the churches and if they have any
questions, they should ask their husbands at home. Paul must be assuming some
implicit delimiting framework since elsewhere he mentions women praying and
prophesying with their heads covered (<b>11</b>:5, 13; cp. Acts<b> 21</b>:9). That
limitation evidently related to respect for husbands (<b>14</b>:35) and orderly
assembly (<b>14</b>:33a). Deference is the issue in the veil wearing discussion
of 1 Corinthians <b>11</b> and in teaching according to 1 Timothy<b> 2</b>. It
is difficult to see how asking questions would indicate insubordination as such.
Paul must not mean “silent” in an absolute sense but has in mind women conducting
themselves in a way <u>that implied deference to their husbands</u> and in a
way <u>that would cause confusion</u> (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:33a). Let the
husband speak for the family. His proscription could be comparable to the
comment about eating at home (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:22). His concern then is
for order and peace; hence, outside that limiting framework his proscription
does not apply.</span></p>

one another” </i>in Ephesians <b>5</b>:21 belongs in an organizational setting,
not simply in an interpersonal one. The participial phrase stands at the head
of all the familial relations Paul goes on to identify, not just the
husband-wife one. So it applies to parent-child relations as well, which would
not be mutual.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:15
does not show that a woman can save herself by having children, because Paul
says, <i>“she will be saved by her childbearing</i>.” Obviously, the apostle
means to use the expression to epitomize the distinctive aspect of a woman’s
role in society and the home. She does not have to leave that role and go off
after some “more important” career to satisfy God and be meaningful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#7030A0'>                  **<i>“Husband of one
wife” </i>(1 Timothy<b> 3</b>:3; <u>Titus <b>1</b>:6</u>) belongs in a moral
setting, not a legal one. It does not address deuterogamy, celibacy, remarriage
after scriptural divorce or conversion, and other amoral marital statuses. While
defending the proposition that Paul was requiring married eldership, some interpreters
have tried to deny that marriage after the death of a spouse (deuterogamy) was
being prohibited here. They may say that a remarried widower would not be the
husband of two wives but one, obviously meaning “one at a time”; but that would
be an unnecessary limitation of meaning for the wording: an unscripturally
remarried divorcee would not be the husband of two wives either. Scripture does
not discuss deuterogamy either way as a moral state for elders <i>per se</i>;
it refers to it only as an acceptable status for general church members. But
that becomes no reason to remove deuterogamy from stricture in 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:3,
because scripture considers it okay for general members to remain unmarried. Such
interpreters have assumed some unexpressed reason for a legal directive here (by
positive commandment <i>vs</i>. moral law via inherent necessity).</span></p>

makes it important to discover a writing’s purpose. Knowing the purpose of
