<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                  1. The meaning of “interpret”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Interpretation involves (1)
discovering the <u>referent</u>, (2) connecting the referent by <u>consistency</u>
with the rest of the big picture (<u>integration</u>), and (3) making <u>application</u>
to issues the author does not address, including the modern needs of believers.
The first two aspects belong to “what it meant”; the last is “what it means.” We
“interpret” (exegesis) to discover “meaning” (integration) so we can
“understand” and have “wisdom” (application). Until we reach a level of understanding
that enables us to use what we know, we do not “understand” in a “useful” way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        First, interpretation means (1) <u>discovering
the referent</u>: discovering what an author had in mind at the time of writing.
There is a distinction between text and referent, but more importantly between
the interpreter’s understanding and the author’s intention. These last two
should be the same, but we must make a theoretical difference between the
author’s thought and the interpreter’s thought. Even if it is the same thought,
it is not guaranteed to be true, because two people are thinking it.
Maintaining that distinction is crucial for the following reasons, chronologically
arranged:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        (a)  If we think we understand, we
are not subject to correction. Because we say, “I see,” our misunderstanding
continues (John <b>9</b>:41).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        (b)  Pride accompanies equating truth
with our apprehension of it, and we set other people at naught: <i>“You were
altogether born in sin, and you are trying to teach <u>us</u>?”</i> <b>9</b>:34a.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        (c)  The behavior of exclusivism—hence,
division—comes from believing “I am right”: <i>“And they excommunicated him</i>
[from the synagogue]<i>”</i>; <b>9</b>:34b.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        The resulting division is marked by
peculiar doctrine, exclusivistic attitude, restrictive fellowship,
distinguishing names, and separate organizations; but the root problem lies in
an inappropriate attitude combined with the failure to distinguish between
objective meaning and subjective perception of meaning. People often look for
security in informational certainty rather than interpersonal certainty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        For at least five reasons people
fail to differentiate their ideas from the meaning of the text. (a) From a <u>psychological
standpoint</u>, since they cannot conceive of any other way to take it, the
text must mean what it obviously means to them. The problem can stem from the
lack of a sufficient concept inventory, which results in taking the closest
idea in their minds as the one meant by the writer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        (b) Sometimes people read the Bible
with a naïve view of the <u>nature of language</u>: <i>“It means what it says!”
</i>They do not seriously entertain the possibility that a statement can have
more than one value and that choosing the right one rests on a contextual and
conceptual base. Language can be ambiguous, so statements can be <u>taken</u>
in more than one way sometimes though <u>meant</u> in only one—except in “word
plays.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        (c) Acknowledging the subjective
variable makes truth seem uncertain; so people downplay the uncertainty by
insisting on literal-first interpretation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        (d) On the basis of certain
expectations about <u>the Spirit’s work</u>, Christians may suppose that the
Holy Spirit, operating parallel to the text, puts into their minds directly the
concepts meant in what they read (occasionalism). Understanding comes
intuitively, not discursively. Impressions, feelings, urges, promptings, and “automatic
inferences” become special illumination from the Spirit. As the divine operates
on the human in inscripturation, so also they suppose the divine operates on
the human in illumination. The Spirit directly implants concepts in the hearer
rather than indirectly through the message. Illumination happens <u>parallel to</u>
proclamation more than <u>through</u> proclamation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'><img width=460 height=102 src="/cir-library/images/essays/c-consequent-nature-of-appropriating-scripture-illumination-virgil-warren-phd/image001.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        (e) People feel uneasy about saying
that what <u>God</u> has said is unclear. The point is that what he said is
unclear <u>to us</u>; the fault is not in the message. Whereas supernatural
involvement through circumstance and personal relationships is possible, it is
not necessary with biblical content any more than with other content. The next
diagram pictures significant ways in which illumination as well as guidance and
empowerment operate other than through the word: indirectly through <u>other
Christians</u> and <u>circumstance</u> and directly through <u>sheer presence</u>.
None of these operations directly deposit ideas. The process is always
interpersonal in that receivers actively accept rather than passively receive. They
reach out to meet what the Spirit provides. The control test on the Spirit’s
involvement in interpretation is the different understanding spirit-filled
people have even on important matters. If direct implanting were so, the implanted
concepts would be the same in every mind.    </span></p>

src="/cir-library/images/essays/c-consequent-nature-of-appropriating-scripture-illumination-virgil-warren-phd/image002.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                  Second, interpretation means (2) <u>integration</u>:
coming to understand how one point relates to other parts of the whole. Among
other things, that concern means properly relating the pieces that make up the
statements and what they point to. When two items are mentioned together in sequence
in a text, the reader wants to know what the ideas or actions “mean,” how they
relate. There are several possibilities for how they relate:  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='color:black'>                        a</span></b><span style='color:
black'> may precede <b>b</b> timewise (chronology). That does not tell a reader
very much about <u>how</u> they relate if they do. That is why we warn about
developing theology out of narrative: the logical relationship between the
aspects of the story is not always evident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='color:black'>                        a</span></b><span style='color:

style='color:black'>                        a</span></b><span style='color:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Thirdly, after finding the referent
and understanding its relationship to the rest of the author’s mind, an
interpreter moves to (3) <u>application</u>: proceeding from “what it meant” to
“what it means.” This moves from theory to practice in the original author’s circumstance;
but more importantly from original times to the modern setting—especially in
the cross-cultural transfer, where the concern is to evangelize rather than culturalize,
Westernize, Americanize. The shift from “meant” to “means” parallels “demythologizing,”
except that the latter usually involves deistic bias. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        In one sense, what it meant is also
what it means; that is, once a statement goes “into the air,” its content is
fixed forever. Readers can switch from what the author meant to what readers
believe, but they cannot change the author’s intentions. Interpretation deals
with meaning; apologetics deals with truth. Neither time nor readership affects
the original meaning of a text. Biblical principles may be applied more broadly
or more narrowly today than in the original writer’s mind because of
differences in culture, but such moves are implications of original intent, not
interpretations of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Application (“what it means”)
involves, among other things, <u>the distinction between covenants</u>. Many
things commanded in the Old Testament do not apply beyond that dispensation—Issues
like Sabbath-keeping, circumcision, tithing, infant baptism, legal <i>vs.</i>
interpersonal nature of the covenant and its provisions. Covenant distinctions apply
even to some statements in the gospels where Jesus commands his immediate
Jewish audience to do what do not apply to his followers later (Matthew <b>5</b>:23-24;
<b>23</b>:1-3, 23). Application also calls for distinguishing precedent from
example, advice from commandment, wisdom from law. (See “Pitfalls in
Interpretation.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Language is not magical as if its
meaning could change with the situation. Contemporary cultures do not represent
a series of colored panes through which original revelation gives different
light. Instead, language and its meaning are constant; otherwise, an
interpreter would be controlling the meaning, and scripture could never stand
in prophetic relationship with human society to critique it and call for
change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        The shift from meant to means
(theological interpretation) involves (4) <u>generalization</u>: inferring the
use of an idea beyond its original setting. Interpreters must ask who is
speaking, who is spoken to, and so on. Generalization follows from the nature
of the case; so it must not apply a principle to unlike situations or make
blanket statements from special cases. Generalization is always to like cases.
(See “Nature of the Case.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'>                              **The promise of Acts <b>1</b>:8
applies to the twelve, but whether it applies more broadly must be determined
by the elements of the situation and the context of the promise. <i>“Uttermost
parts of the earth”</i> may involve more than the lifetime of the apostles;
consequently, whether directly or indirectly, miraculously or interpersonally, the
<u>empowerment</u> promised to them may not apply beyond them and their
lifetime. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'>                              **<u>Evangelizing</u> the
world as per the Great Commission of Matthew <b>28</b>:19-20 is similar to
empowerment. The kingdom is for creating a new united mankind (Ephesians <b>2</b>:15);
as long as that task remains unfinished, the commandment applies to those who
live after the apostles died.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'>                              **<i>“Go sell what you have
and give it to the poor . . . and come follow me” </i>(Mark <b>10</b>:21),
however, applies only to the rich young ruler; not every Christian is expected
to forego <u>private property</u> unless it serves as a stumbling block—as it
did to this man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'>                              **Some have argued for
generalizing the promise of <u>miraculous gifts</u><b> </b>because the promise
accompanies the permanent commission to evangelize. What might be possible may
not be actual for all Christians. That does not make the two promises
co-extensive, because the nature of the cases is not the same. The gospel <u>is</u>
for converting people; it is not for amazing them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'>                              **Matthew <b>5</b>:31-32
talks about unchastity in general, not incestuous marriage, betrothal, or some
other more specific sexual deviance. As a result, <u>divorce</u> in general
compares with adultery in the general sense Jesus means, not to rare and
special cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'>                              **2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:3,
<i>“giving according to their power,”</i> is used to refer to tithing and <i>“</i>[giving]
<i>beyond their power”</i> to refer to giving beyond tithing. But 2 Corinthians
<b>8-9</b> deals with a special benevolence offering, not the ongoing support
of the ministry in general. So Paul means that some gave more than they could
really afford to give.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        To some people, “interpretation” is
not something we should do; we should “take the text at face value.” But interpretation
does not make a text into something the writer did not mean; it comes to
understand what the writer did mean. Interpretation is (1) finding the referent
that lies beyond the words. Since meaning also has to do with (2) the
relationship one item has with the rest of what is meant, it places a
communication in its proper frame of reference. Putting something in context qualifies
it, focuses it, limits its scope, and clarifies it. <i>“Taking the text at face
value”</i> does not mean affirming that it means the first thing that comes to
mind or what is its most literal way of being understood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Modern art and the literary use of
the Bible introduce a practice that <u>is</u> problematic. In these disciplines
the point is not so much to communicate something as to provide a suggestive
form that stimulates observers to create their own content. The readers arter
as much involved creatively as the artist-writer. The Bible does not have that
character; so interpreting it does not follow that pattern. Scripture does not
“inspire” to creating the reader’s content, but to creating the reader’s response
to its own content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        The view of the meaning of
scripture derives from the view of the meaning of the events scripture
recounts. <u>Providence</u> (<i>past</i>) says that the meaning of the event is
<u>in</u> the event, not just <u>read into</u> it. <u>Eschatological theology</u>
(<i>future</i>) says that the meaning of the event is determined by what it becomes.
What it eventuates into, however, depends on what viewers make of it—the Christ
event, for example. The meaning of the event may be <i>seen</i> in what develops
from it, as we say, <i>“Let’s see what comes of it”</i> or even, <i>“Hindsight
is better than foresight.” </i>But the meaning of Christ would have been the same
if history had stopped the next month. Sometimes the meaning of an event is not
even possible to see by looking at it (John <b>11</b>:41-42; <b>13</b>:12).
Furthermore, it is an event, not a statement. A <u>statement</u> means what it
was originally intended to mean, which in this case reveals the significance
God intended into the underlying <u>events</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        <u>Existentialism</u> (<i>present</i>)
says that the meaning is what the participant senses during the experience.
Again, the sum of its content is determined by the viewer. <u>Providence</u>, however,
says that the meaning of the event is <i>in</i> the event because it was <i>intended
into</i> the event. Providence and predestination guarantee the meaning of
events objectively because the Author of history decided what he would bring
about before it occurred. The reason for bringing it about becomes its
significance whether anyone sees it or not. Since the events recorded have built-in
objective meaning, people cannot take the record to mean whatever “speaks to them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        <u>Exegesis</u> gets the author’s
intended meaning out of the text, a process sometimes called “historical-grammatical
interpretation”: “what it meant.” This step includes finding the referent and
understanding its relationship to the rest of an author’s understanding
(consistency). By inference <u>interpretation</u> extracts the principles
behind the statements to learn how to deal with issues not directly addressed: application
and generalization. Interpreting in this sense finds the functional equivalent
of a matter in another culture or era: “theological interpretation,” “what it
means” now. <u>Hermeneutics</u> is often technicalized to designate the process
of getting from exegesis to interpretation. <u>Theological method</u> systematizes
the whole Christian understanding and derives its overall structure. Finally,
we may add for the sake of completeness that <u>translation</u> takes all of
this as expressed in one language and expresses it in another language. The
Greek word from which English gets “hermeneutics” meant both to “translate” and
to “explain.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                  2. The effect of the view of scripture on
interpretation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        The nature of scripture determines what
procedures fit with interpreting it. The <u>reliability</u> of the record can
affect <u>what</u> a passage means and especially <u>how</u> we get to it. Since
this “library” came from many authors over many centuries, assuming the <u>consistency</u>
of its parts is a presupposition necessary for understanding them as parts of
the same whole.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        a. The accuracy of scripture&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              The harmony and reliability
of scripture allows combining insights from various places. The procedure works
if all the writers are speaking about parts of the same whole. Otherwise, we
would have to limit what material we could bring to bear on the meaning of a text.
We would have to limit ourselves to writers from the same time and place, to
books by the same author, to the immediate book, or even to one segment of a
book in cases of assumed source documents; we would have no reason to believe
in a common understanding. It would be artificial to take the writings of
several teachers in even the same Christian college and use insights from one
to clarify statements by another. Without assuming the common ultimate
authorship by the Spirit, there would be less legitimacy in combining
information from the more than forty authors, spread over 1500 years, writing
from times of apostasy and a wide variety of circumstances. Since many scholars
do not suppose the harmony of scripture, they object to harmonizing as
artificial. At best, what is common to all the writers constitutes
non-negotiable aspects of the Christian faith; items peculiar to one writer
become more negotiable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Supposing that a writing is
not true makes it harder to understand. Readers hurry through it with less
motivation to clear up ambiguities and work out apparent contradictions. Since they
have no reason to believe the parts do harmonize, they may caricature pieces that
do not strike them as likely. Exaggeration compounds the interpretation problem
by introducing foreign factors. People with an anti-supernatural bias stand at
odds with much of biblical content because they discount its manner of origin.
Supernatural assistance is required for getting a harmonious message from different
authors under diverse circumstances over so much time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              In relation to predictive prophecy
especially, the anti-supernatural bias may cause readers to misidentify the
referent of the prediction. They eliminate any fulfillment that could not have been
guessed ahead of time. Naturalistic bias lies behind treating Old Testament predictions
as “realized eschatology,” that is, prophecy written after the fact but put in
the form of prediction to emphasize the utter certainty of why it occurred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              By and large, however, the
view of scripture more greatly affects what and how much of it a person <u>believes</u>,
but it should have less effect on what and how much of it they <u>understand</u>.
The former deals with truth; the latter with meaning. The reason Christian
might disagree with something in the New Testament is that they adopt as true
what they consider fundamental, but think that some secondary teachings are
false because New Testament writers made culture-bound inferences from first
principles. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              </span><span
style='color:#7030A0'>An example is the Galatians <b>3</b>:28 statement that in
Christ there is no <u>male or female</u>—taken as a universal principle rather
than a soteriological assertion. Paul erred in his teaching elsewhere about
men-women roles, because he did not make them in every respect interchangeable.
Paul’s application of the equality principle was either clouded by current circumstances
or was done to avoid having essential Christianity rejected because of
secondary applications. He dealt pastorally rather than idealistically in the
hope that underlying attitudes would “eat away” at cultural evils until they
had transformed the culture from within. His manner of handling the slavery
issue serves as the model for handling other issues like women’s roles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              As an aside, we may do well
to say that all scripture having ultimately one Author does not suggest uniform
word meaning or symbolic significances (water for “people” in apocalyptic
materials, <i>e.g</i>.). The Bible is not a single treatise where readers expect
to find consistent terminology throughout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              One destructive effect in
hermeneutics comes from source critical approaches to the Pentateuch, certain Old
Testament prophets, the synoptic gospels, and some epistles. Making the
resultant “writing” a patchwork strips away context and increases ambiguity;
interpretable units are reduced to such small segments that less can be said
for sure. About the only basis for continuity would lie in the redactor. Interpretation
is significantly impacted by inerrancy. Fragmentation plus denying inerrancy
weakens context as an aid to understanding. Interpreters have to stay <u>within
an author’s set of writings</u> (the Pauline corpus) or <u>within the same book</u>
(because a writer’s thinking changes). In the case of source-critical methods,
a person has to stay <u>within the same fragment</u>. Genesis <b>1</b>, for
instance, does not provide a context for Genesis <b>2</b> because they originated
separately. Readers cannot operate <u>within the whole Bible</u> because they
have no justification for affirming homogeneity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        b. The role of scripture</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Is scripture, particularly the
New Testament, a law code, a historical document, a handbook, a manual? Do we
expect it to specify behavior and beliefs at a relatively detailed level, or do
we anticipate finding principles for answering life’s questions? Is the New
Testament to the church what the Old Testament was to Israel or what the Koran
is to Islam? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Considering the New Testament
to be for the church what the Old Testament was for Israel requires remembering
that they are <u>different covenants</u> and <u>different kinds of covenants</u>.
Otherwise, we carry the correlation too far and end up reading the New
Testament as a body of law rather than as an interpersonal system. If it is a
constitution like the Torah and the Koran, its statements take on a legal
quality, which gives greater rigidity to language and its ideas. (See “Interpretation
of Classes of Literature.”) “Legal methodology” adjusts the interpretation process
by giving (a) <u>silence</u> greater power to prohibit. A body of law is
designed to take care of practical situations people typically face. (See “Confusing
Precedent and Example.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              A legal framework gives (b) <u>precedent</u>
greater value. We more likely assume that apostles did what they did because
they were specifically directed to do so. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Legal methodology legitimizes
(c) <u>biblical positivism</u> as a replacement for church authority or direct
Holy Spirit guidance as a safeguard against the accretions of time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Finally, legal methodology
fosters (d) <u>quantification</u>. We expect specifications on the amount of
giving; the frequency of praying, fasting, and observing communion; the number
of times to forgive someone. Instead of the <i>book</i> or the <i>church</i>,
theological method should be based on <i>the nature of the case </i>as
interpersonal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              The legal approach to
scripture leads to supposing that the New Testament answers all questions about
faith and practice, bends statements to address issues they were never intended
to address; changes silence into prohibition, example into precedent,
non-restrictive into restrictive; multiplies instances of positivism, and
eliminates implicit cultural limitation. Law does not represent the nature and
purpose of the Christian faith and so does not set the method of interpreting
its message. Alternative to the legal-constitutional approach, we need to adopt
the New Testament as an interpersonal system that calls for an interpersonal
approach to interpreting its literature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        c. Scripture as common use of human
language</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              The Bible is a divine message
communicated in (a) <u>human language</u>—“The word of God in the words of men.”
It is written in (b) the <u>common use of human language</u>—in popular style,
in the language of the people—rather than in technical jargon, scientific
precision, or philosophical style. The language of the New Testament is koine, common,
or Hellenistic Greek. It is not couched in abstract verbiage, laden with specialized
terminology, or concerned with scientific perspective. It contains a healthy mixture
of figurative, poetic, phenomenological language. (c) The biblical message is
not expressed in an <u>esoteric code</u> known only to an elite few. Biblical
language demonstrates normal ways of speaking and being understood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              The law of <u>minimum
affirmation</u> runs counter to people’s expectations. <b>One plague in Bible
study is trying to get too much out of a text</b>.<b> </b>People may think in
extremes, perhaps because they have a habit of black-white, all-or-nothing, binary
reasoning. They assume that “being more exact is being more correct.” But in
interpretation, making the lesser claim charts a safer course. It does not
“outdrive its headlights”; it does not claim more than it can be sure of. It is
safer because (a) language is somewhat imprecise (Note “Sources of Ambiguity in
Scripture.”), because (b) interpersonal truth has a more fluid character than
does scientific truth, legal process, and logical validity; and because (c)
truth in general tends to lie between extremes. <u>Hermeneutical restraint</u> must
prevail in practical matters because the lack of it works against Christian
unity and mission. Enough difficulties exist in core matters that people do
well not to see how much they can get out of a text. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              In constitutional matters,
lawyers are to use <u>judicial restraint</u>, which contrasts with using the
constitution to solve all problems whether it deals with them or not. The New
Testament relates to Christian living the same way. Not every issue is dealt
with directly or by implication. In unaddressed matters people choose what is
best on fundamental principles as they see the situation. Errors in unrevealed
areas are not reckoned against a person’s record; where there is no guidance
there is no disobedience (Romans <b>5</b>:13). The interpreter needs to
distinguish <i>conceivable</i> from <i>necessary</i> meaning. Minimum
affirmation means what can be said for sure. It is akin to the <u>law of
parsimony</u>, which says that the lesser explanation is more likely correct. Interpretation
does well to adopt the lesser claim that accounts for the data.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Minimum affirmation
corresponds with “the law of minimum meaning.” In the statement “Redheads are
hot tempered,” a person is better off to suppose the speaker is voicing an
interesting observation rather than an absolute rule. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              One additional reason for not
expecting close wording of texts comes from the use of <u>amanuenses</u> by some
New Testament writers. We cannot know what freedom Paul or Peter may have given
Tertius and Silvanus to editorialize copy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#7030A0'>                              Aristotle said, <i>“One
swallow does not make a summer”</i> (<i>Metaphysics</i> <b>12</b>:7). One
incident does not establish a pattern; one example does not establish a
precedent. People make “snap judgments,” make “hasty generalizations,” “jump to
conclusions,” or “rush to judgment.” Someone may say, “You always . . .” after seeing
just a case or two. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              In some instances, what an
author meant cannot be discovered, because there may not be enough clues to
reconstruct the author’s mind. In such cases interpretation must suspend
judgment lest false presuppositions take over. If presuppositions err,
interpretation goes awry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span

shine “from east to west” at the Lord’s return (Matthew <b>24</b>:27), and the
fig tree that <i>“withered from the roots up”</i> (Mark <b>11</b>:20).</span></p>

for claiming that tithing was “practiced” in the patriarchal age. “Practice”

style='color:black'>                        d.   From the beginning (see “Great
Commission”), the gospel was intended to be trans-cultural. People who work
across languages speak more loosely because fine nuances get lost in
translation. The Greek record in the gospels was translated from Aramaic
discourses, which means that close wording is not as likely. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                  3. Biblical-systematic hermeneutic</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Scripture is “historically
organized”; its parts address practical needs of the times. The Bible is not
“conceptually organized”; it does not systematically define terms and then lay
out material topically. Interpreting it, then, has more complexity than (1)
following through an ordered doctrinal presentation. Not everything about one
subject is found in one place; only as much of a subject is treated in each
place as was needed for the problem addressed there. Topical understanding must
be extracted from the historical documents, assembled into a conceptual whole,
and generalized to matters that face the contemporary church. Readers collect
information from various places and derive the full picture. That can happen because
they consider the text “inspired by God” and therefore possessing a
self-consistent perspective. (See <i>What the Bible Says About Salvation</i>,
p. 2.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Interpretation has more to it than
(2) working out items and adding them together to discover what picture they
form. The whole meaning is more than the sum of the parts of meaning. The
meaning of a word, sentence, paragraph, chapter, or book does not come from
adding together the pieces that comprise it. The whole communication forms a
gestalt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Rather, (3) reciprocity occurs
between particular passages and general picture. The general picture puts
individual statements in context and brings them into focus; one individual
statement can provide a general picture that clarifies other specific verses;
the accumulated clarity may unpack yet other specifics, and so forth. There is
(a) <u>an interaction between specific and general</u>, between exegesis and
theology, between verses and topics, between induction and deduction. As to the
truth itself, a specific does not precede the general in inductive fashion, nor
does the general precede a specific as if the general first had to be
supernaturally deposited by the Holy Spirit. In coming to understand truth
itself, we look for seminal verses (like Habakkuk <b>2</b>:4) and trace out
their ramifications and connections. Other verses add to the first one with its
implications, so a larger, clearer whole emerges. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                         “If people do not think rightly
about God, they cannot understand the Bible.” “If people do not understand the
Bible, they will not think rightly about God.” The apparent problem is how they
can understand God through the Bible if they cannot understand the Bible
without a correct view of God. We might answer this problem by supposing an act
of regeneration in which illumination comes from operation on the nature of
man. The mystic might suppose there is a literal flight of the soul to God,
which would add special experience to scripture content. Instead, the answer
lies in reciprocation between whole and parts and between life experience and propositional
revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        A second aspect of interpretation
is (b) <u>crosswise harmonizing between topics</u>. What we do with one topic often
modifies what we do with other topics. The interpretation process is reciprocal
and interactive, and participates in what is sometimes called “circular
causation.” The following diagram shows the overall process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>   <img width=393 height=134
src="/cir-library/images/essays/c-consequent-nature-of-appropriating-scripture-illumination-virgil-warren-phd/image009.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>The full picture emerges from this procedure rather than from
a whole-cloth message directly given parallel to the written message. Divine
implantation is as unnecessary here as it is on non-religious topics. By way of
the law of harmony, the law of negation, and the nature of the case, we “reason
in the scripture” from specific to general, from general to specific, and from
topic to topic. The biblical-systematic process works part-to-whole, cross
doctrines, and reciprocation within the overall process. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Because materials from different passages
differ in their <u>degree of clarity</u>, (4) we must take the unclear in light
of the clear and the situational in light of the general. Poetic, prophetic,
and historical materials are taken in light of didactic materials. (See “Confusing
Example and Precedent.”) Understanding the ambiguous in light of the clear keeps
the burden of proof on the affirmative. An idea conceivably associated with a
text often cannot be <u>disproved</u>, but that does not make it true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Because the total information on some
biblical topics is not clear, (5) the role of hermeneutics is restrictive more
than positive. Instead of identifying specifics, it establishes boundaries. In some
doctrinal matters, scripture does not give sufficient information to establish
precise ideas. We have to content ourselves with drawing circles within which
the truth must fall and allow opinion to operate on choices within that circle.
We can say what something does <u>not</u> mean, but not what it <u>does</u>
mean. Interpretation serves only to establish latitude within orthodoxy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Biblical-systematic interpretation
contrasts with (a) systematic deduction from some first principle (scholastic
methodology), and with (b) biblical positivism, where each item is supposedly affirmed
directly and clearly in a way that interpreters are not responsible for
dilemmas created by their exegesis. Taking responsibility for dilemmas would supposedly
put human reason above scripture! Such a notion puts human reason above
scripture anyway by hanging with dilemmas created by human reason in the exegetical
process. Dilemmas are clues that exegesis has failed. “Biblical positivism”
loses wholeness and limits us to what we can know inductively. Without
systematic advantage, our work is limited to individual texts and reliance on
word meanings. That leaves us open to proof texting from passages that others
handle differently, and gives us no recourse for getting behind the
alternatives by appealing to the big picture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        A more wholesome, though inadequate,
kind of biblical positivism is to take as true in principle every statement the
Bible without necessarily understanding what they mean. That leaves
interpretation in limbo and reduces the practical use of the message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        The Bible is also not like a repair
manual. We do not bring our question to the Bible expecting to find a specific
answer. That expectancy would foster interpreting the Bible as a book of
disconnected sections; it treats verses like proverbs. Verse and chapter
divisions reinforce that inclination, particularly if verses appear separately
rather than in paragraphs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Biblical-systematic interpretation
contrasts with (c) positing a hypothesis and amassing data to substantiate it.
It does not take advantage of the reciprocation between parts and whole that
enables adjusting the whole by the parts and vice versa. (See “Pitfalls of
Interpretation.”) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                         “Biblical-systematic hermeneutic”
roughly corresponds to scientific method. When we encounter a difficulty, we
(1) postulate a framework from the data we have, (2) check to see whether
anything contradicts it, and (3) see whether the hypothesis elucidates other
data. The procedure does risk the danger of positing a conclusion and working
toward it. (See “Pitfalls of Interpretation.”) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Biblical-systematic hermeneutic
means that what does not derive from first principles must come from positive
commandment. For an example of this observation, see <i>What the Bible Says
About Salvation</i>, pp. 396-98.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Establishing the fundamental
character of Christianity is the most important thing for biblical-systematic
interpretation to do. From there on, that “theological method” suggests
interpretations of texts and sets boundaries on ways of understanding texts and
issues. From a systematic investigation into scripture, we have concluded that
Christianity is primarily, centrally, essentially, ultimately interpersonal.
Its interpersonal character then sets the character of specific matters within
that Christian worldview and raises possibilities for understanding individual
passages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                  4. The idea of peculiar principles for interpreting
the Bible</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        The positive burden of proof leads
to not expecting special principles for biblical interpretation. Three reasons,
however, incline people toward that idea:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.25in;text-align:
justify'><span style='color:black'>                              (1) to
exonerate New Testament teaching based on Old Testament texts seemingly irrelevant
to New Testament applications. Since normal principles do not justify the
application, peculiar ones are proposed. The New Testament, however, does not
use artificial “interpretations” of Old Testament passages. It may use an Old
Testament text merely to <u>picture</u> the New Testament writer’s idea, not to
<u>prove</u> it. In such instances people do not get <u>why</u> the author
cites the passage; they misinterpret the writer’s interpretation. In other
cases, they miss something actually in the Old Testament text itself or implied
by it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0in'><span
style='color:black'>            (2) to get scripture to conform to our
presuppositions </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0in'><span

more by what he says </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        a. Double reference</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              One modern impetus for double
reference stems from dispensationalism, which anticipates an earthly millennial
kingdom as per Old Testament predictions. The spiritual aspect of Messiah’s
kingdom has already been infused into history via the church; the political
overlay is yet to be “added.” The “second” fulfillment is the “rest” of the
prediction. This theology of the kingdom parallels the Pharisees’ expectations,
which Jesus had to combat during his ministry, as well as the Judaizers’
teachings, which Paul disputed in his missionary efforts to Gentiles. The New
Testament gives us no reason to anticipate any additional fulfillment of
kingdom prophecies beyond what its writers have already identified as
fulfillments. If there is more, there is no way to tell that yet; we would have
to “wait and see.”</span></p>

an illusion based on a false view of language and scripture. One difficulty
lies in determining the order of its writings; the arrangement of books in the
Bible is not chronological. Usually a word with more than one usage has a predominant
one; so statistically the first usage likely has that significance. One may as
well have a law of middle mention or last mention. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Admittedly the oldest usage
of key terms in an expanding literature may set precedent for subsequent usage.
The idea is akin to the principle of using Bible terms in biblical ways when
discussing biblical topics today. However, <u>prominent texts</u> have as
likely a direction-setting effect on such a matter as <u>early texts</u> do. (cp.
Hebrews <b>2</b>:4 &lt; Genesis <b>1-3</b>; Habakkuk <b>2</b>:4 &lt; Romans,
Galatians, and Hebrews.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        c. Fourfold interpretation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              People may suppose that God,
being greater, can do more with human language than humans do, so they would
not be surprised to find “levels” of meaning in it: the literal, analogical,
allegorical, tropological (“fourfold interpretation”). Philo of Alexandria, an
early Jewish scholar, championed the notion of multiple meanings. Subsequently
the practice came into the church; setting it aside was a major triumph of the
Reformation. The problem had become so serious late in church history that the
Westminster Confession included an article that said, <i>“The meaning of
scripture is not manifold, but one.”</i> The article does not mean that a
certain wording is <u>incapable</u> of being used in more than one way, but
that a statement is not <u>intended</u> to mean more than one thing at a time.
The “oneness” of meaning in a statement comes from the very purpose of statements;
otherwise, communication could not occur. The Bible has to follow the rules for
language usage generally or readers could claim to find most anything in Holy
Writ. That is a big enough problem as it is. The nature of language is not
altered by who uses it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              While a reader can see how a passage
could have more than one possible meaning, the reader does not suppose that the
<u>writer</u> had them all in mind. The author may have meant one but did not
write with sufficient precision for readers to discover which one. The author
may have meant a general concept that includes more than one precise idea.
Scripture has no secret code for esoteric messages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              We distinguish between what a
passage means, what it could mean, what it is analogous to, what it can be
applied to, and what subsequent implications and levels of generalization it
might have. Analogy and application do not pertain to the meaning of a statement;
those come from a reader’s sanctified creativity. A text does not mean
everything it could mean, but what the author intended it to mean in this case.
Trying to make a word carry all its meanings in the same instance is called “illegitimate
totality transfer.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              In denying that people need
supernatural aid to understand the Bible, we have in mind <i>a general rule</i>;
God could supernaturally assist for some practical reason. Furthermore, the
supernatural assistance we refer to is <i><u>direct</u> operation on the <u>ontic
nature</u> of man</i>, because we see no reason for believing in the
inheritable natural depravity that would necessitate supernatural aid. The
Spirit may help, but his supernatural help is not required. He may assist, even
supernaturally, in <u>indirect</u> ways through other Christians, through
providential intervention that alters experience and triggers understanding. He
could even be said to assist through his interpersonal relationship itself.
(See “Divine Guidance” in “Gifts of the Spirit” materials.) If the Spirit
uniformly provides direct, supernatural assistance to all Christians by
necessity, we wonder why equally sincere people disagree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              While standing outside the
faith, we can understand enough about it to enter into it, especially with the
assistance of God’s spokesmen. Accepting the Christian faith before
experiencing it is not a unique pattern; it happens with any new commitment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Regarding supernatural
enablement, we must distinguish (1) understanding and believing; (2)
understanding and being interested in, seeing the need for, sensing the
importance of what we understand; (3) understanding and understanding fully,
especially experiential matters. The same problems exist in other than
Christian matters as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        e.   Literal taking precedence over
figurative interpretation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Literal over figurative may work
statistically, but that does not settle individual cases. Just because a
statement could make some sense literally does not mean the author meant it literally.
If authorial intent is basic, we need to take words the way the author meant
them in regard to the question of literalness as surely as in any other
consideration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              </span><span
style='color:#7030A0'>Creationists often call for literal over figurative in
Genesis <b>1</b> by saying that people do not believe the Bible if they do not
believe in twenty-four-hour <u>days</u>. It seems more likely that Moses used
the enjoined seven-day week for Israel as a literary device for presenting
major sets of God’s creative acts. Exact sequence and precise length of time
give way to topical intent—to show that the creator of the whole universe is
the one that Israelites were to worship rather than the gods of the surrounding
nations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              We do well to acknowledge
degrees of figurativeness, and that literal historical accounts may contain figurative
expressions. </span></p>

style='color:black'>                              </span><span
style='color:#7030A0'>A historical understanding of Genesis <b>1-3</b> does not

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Jesus’ disciples
misunderstood his comment about the leaven of the Pharisees, his statement that
Lazarus was asleep, his destroying the temple and rebuilding it in three days.
All three cases could have made sense taken literally, but that is not the way
he meant them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Students of the Bible do not
always have the same thing in mind when they speak of “literal”; so “literal”
is itself ambiguous. It might mean (1) the most concrete, (2) what is closest
to the derivational word-picture, or (3) what is the most usual meaning.
Actually, it is better to adopt #3 and to speak of the more conventional meaning
than to speak of literal meaning. An originally “concrete” usage may become
figurative and may be used predominantly that way; the “normal” way of using it
would be figurative. The reason the primary meaning tends to be “literal” is
that people more often speak in concrete ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              Supposing literal over
figurative creates a negative burden of proof. A better approach <i>builds a
positive basis for whatever view a person takes.</i> Preferring literal over
figurative is not particularly self-evident, especially in light of Jesus’ love
for metaphor and parable. The preference depends on the parenthesized numbers
below. </span></p>

of language usage (<u>convention</u>). Setting up a hermeneutical preference
for literal may reflect a tendency of modern Western usage in the scientific
age. A secondary motivation may be to undergird a certain theological system,
as with those who expect a political kingdom of God on earth, those who adopt
Augustinian anthropology, those who espouse Calvinistic theology, or those who
promote fiat creationism. A study of biblical rhetoric indicates that it is
more replete with imagery than, say, modern English. The Bible has more
“colorful” expression than American custom does.</span></p>

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              We take in a secondary
(figurative) sense those elements clearly not in harmony with experience or the
pattern of divine operation revealed elsewhere. In other words, one reason for
figurative interpretation is <i>to avoid what would cause contradiction if
taken literally</i>. Another rule, laid down by Clement of Alexandria, is that <i>those
things are to be considered figurative that are unworthy of God</i>. There is a
degree of subjectivism here, and we wonder if it is not rather a matter of
avoiding contradiction with what is elsewhere revealed about God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              One final factor integrates
the literal-figurative variable with the intent-of- statement principle. We
regard the Spirit as the ultimate author of scripture. This point (1) allows an
author to say things he could not know naturally. It (2) even allows for
prophets to say things they did not understand (1 Peter <b>1</b>:10-12). It
also (3) allows a prophet to say something an interpreter might normally suppose
would have been meant one way but was meant another way. Everyone agrees that anyone
can mean more than a listener can ascertain. Similarly, the Spirit may have
more in mind or something slightly different from what even his spokesman might
suppose. For example, Old Testament prophets can sound like they espoused a
moralizing view of history; that is, sin and misfortune have a one-for-one
correlation at the personal level. The prophets themselves perhaps thought of
these things literally; but God did not necessarily so mean them; consequently,
the interpreter would be free to consider them as figurative, involving
indirect operation and non-uniform pattern. (Note this point in relation to our
work of interpretation and our view of scripture above.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                              An example of taking things
figuratively when they create conflict literally is the series of cases where
conflicting figures about the same thing do not give conflicting messages about
it: God dwells in thick darkness (Exodus <b>20</b>:21); yet he rises up early
to send his prophets (2 Chronicles <b>36</b>:15; Jeremiah<b> 7</b>:25, <i>etc</i>.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                  5.   The place of the Holy Spirit in illumination</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        Illumination refers to the enlightenment
that comes to a hearer. Historical theology has developed the belief in supernatural
enlightenment in consequence of natural depravity in man. It envisions
heightened perception and conceptual implantation parallel to proclamation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        1 Corinthians<b> 2</b>:14 has been
used as one basis for the concept of supernatural illumination: “Natural human
beings do not welcome the things of God’s Spirit, because they are foolishness
to them; and they cannot come to know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.” However, Paul is describing natural human beings <i>vs. </i>spiritual
ones; he does not explain that the reason for this behavior lies in an
inherited fallen nature. Natural humans do not welcome spiritual truth and they
cannot come to know it on their own. Paul could speak to Christians who were
not spiritual, but carnal (<b>3</b>:1). He declares that unspiritual people do
not want to hear spiritual things, not that they cannot hear them. He speaks of
psychological, not natural, depravity. How such people become willing is not
addressed, unless Paul demonstrates that they can be made willing by addressing
them as he does in these very comments. Paul could also be declaring a
generality regarding unspiritual people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        We need not deny the <u>possibility</u>
of supernatural operation in illumination, even though we deny the <u>necessity</u>
of it since we deny the doctrine of natural depravity and affirmed instead
psychological depravity. Supernatural activity may occur indirectly at God’s
discretion through circumstance or other Christians (or even through the sheer
presence), but such operation would not be direct on the substantive nature of the
person. God could do it—perhaps for timeliness purposes—to help someone like
Peter see something even though he would not normally need to do so. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>                        The doctrine of supernatural
illumination blends understanding with belief. Cases exist where attitude makes
it improbable that people will put out enough effort to understand; they may
“try to <u>mis</u>understand” because they can see that what they would <u>understand</u>
would lay a claim on their life. The pattern happens more specifically with
belief, however, and speaks to people’s psychological depravity. Sometimes
people caricature Christianity to make disbelief look more intellectually respectable.
Jesus got at this problem in John <b>8</b>:37 when he asked the Pharisees why
they could not understand him. He spoke of his words <i>“not having free course
in them.”</i> They were not “open” and intellectually “honest.” Generally,
though, since people do not require supernatural aid to understand other
things, we wonder why they would need it here. Furthermore, the phenomenon
occurs in Christians (who need correction) as much as in non-Christians (who
need conversion).</span></p>
