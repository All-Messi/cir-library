heart, the human messenger opens the heart, God opens the heart through the
messenger, and the hearer opens his heart. Is it that the messengers speak of
God’s opening the heart because they do not want to take any credit that
belongs to the power in the content of a message they did not originate, or is
it because he did something to the hearers’ hearts while the messengers
proclaimed the gospel? Is it that the hearers speak of God’s opening their
heart because they do not want to take any credit for something they knew they
would never have done if God had not taken the initiative, or is it that he
caused them to do something they knew could never have happened from the sheer power
inherent in the message? Is the power of God exerted to enable the heart or to
change the able heart? Unless some principle is found for getting behind these
dilemmas, the process of exegesis is at a stalemate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The upshot of all this is that in
the case of human action, God does the good in the same sense that Satan does
the evil. The activity of a human person is credited to (a) its ultimate
inspiring source or (b) to its permissive ratifier; surely people are not just
pawns in the hands of supernatural contestants. A good example of crediting an
act to its ultimate inspiring source is Philippians <b>2</b>:13, <i>“For it is
God that is working in you both to will and to do.”</i> Paul means evidently
that God is, and should be, the motivating source of their high resolves so
that their obedience does not depend on Paul’s presence (contrast Augustine in <i>The
City of God</i> <b>22</b>:2). Using the Satan statements as controls on the God
statements, we may conclude that linguistic and theological mechanisms are
employed in expressing a point other than perhaps the immediate impression an
English reader may receive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  From a practical standpoint a
principle is needed for transcending the deadlock between certain pairs of
passages. The hermeneutical program is to select principles that do not produce
interpretations that ultimately violate the self-consistency of God, that is,
do not eventuate in the great dilemma: God’s desire to save all men + his decision
to save some + the fact of his self-consistency. This method does not guarantee
correct understanding, but in principle it eliminates a class of incorrect
ones. In the areas of anthropology and soteriology, it provides a method for
working with texts often arrayed against each other by interpreters of opposite
viewpoints. From the theoretical standpoint the above passages about Satan's
activity seem to suggest directions the answer may take, and so a list of
relevant linguistic phenomena appears below.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Streamlining causal distinctions</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The differences between occasional,
material, formal, instrumental-efficient-moving cause, final cause, originating
cause are not always kept in common parlance. Streamlining causal distinctions
may be expected in scripture also. Biblical writers were men with strong
God-consciousness, which accentuated the Semitic tendency to omit intermediate
causes. Since the universe is God’s universe, every event in it falls under his
jurisdiction. Even the evil that exists is God’s doing insofar as he is
responsible for it. Much of Augustinian-Calvinistic anthropology exhibits a
tendency to read causal statements as efficient causation. This practice is
conjoined with, or produces, the further tendency to consider in terms of the
category of nature those matters that are functional and relational, or at
least to try to reduce them to the category of nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Passages exhibiting such
streamlining of causes are sometimes taken to mean that men are unable to
respond unaided to the influence exerted on them by the message, by
circumstance, and by interpersonal relationships. John <b>6</b>:37 says, <i>“All
that the Father gives me will come to me, and those who comes to me I will in
no wise cast out.”</i> Giving people to the Son does not eliminate their
ability to come to the Son. The Father designed salvation to involve the coming
of people to the Son; and the Son, working with the Father, accepts them. In
the same chapter Jesus says that the <i>Father “gives you the true Bread out of
heaven” </i>(<b>6</b>:32), even while he speaks of his coming <i>“down from
heaven to do God’s will”</i> (<b>6</b>:38). Jesus was delivered by God’s determinate
counsel and foreknowledge (Acts <b>2</b>:23) even though he laid down his life
of himself (John <b>10</b>:11-18, <i>etc</i>.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Causal distinction includes within
it the difference between <u>permissive and prescriptive will</u>. Calvinism
more customarily reads the will of God as prescriptive will. In place of
permission-prescription as used here, Calvinism has necessity and compulsion,
forced from the inside <i>vs.</i> forced from the outside. Permission allows
choice between possibilities and initiation outside of God, whereas it is
difficult to see how these possibilities can exist under necessity and
compulsion. E. M. B. Green comments that permission-prescription is not
linguistically distinguished in Semitic dialects (<i>The Meaning of Salvation</i>,
p. 13). The “raised up” passages are a case in point. Since God is omnipotent,
he can intervene and stop whatever is contrary to his purposes. Everything that
happens, then, happens only because he allows it. Prescriptive and permissive
matters are the same in that they are God’s active will, but they differ
importantly in their essential originating cause: In the former the decision is
initiated in the mind of God while in the latter the decision is initiated in
the mind of some other being under God’s ratifying control. Divine
glorification, purposefulness, and security come under both modes of divine
will. Man’s action allowed by God may be called God's action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Perhaps another way of
conceptualizing this matter of causal series is <u>direct and</u> <u>indirect
operation</u>. People cannot come to the Son unless the Father draws them, but
the drawing is through the proclaimed word they learn (John <b>6</b>:44-45);
and the “cannot” of their coming is circumstantial, not natural, a difference
elaborated under the next main principle below. A ready illustration of
indirectness is the ability of Hebrew idiom to speak of a man’s begetting a
distant descendant; the correlative expression “son of” for a distant ancestor
is the same thing in reverse. Paul persecuted Jesus (Acts <b>9</b>:5; <b>22</b>:8;
<b>26</b>:4)!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Romans <b>8</b>:29 is commonly
appealed to by non-Calvinists as an argument against Calvinistic
predestination: (1) <i>“Whom he foreknew he predestined.”</i> The response poses
a logically prior question: <i>“Foreknowledge of what?” “Foreknowledge of
faith”</i> is the answer. A question is then asked: (2<i>) “How did the person
get that faith?” “God gave it to the person” </i>is the Calvinist’s contention.
But again, a prior question may be raised: (3) <i>“How did God give the person
that faith?”</i> Paul’s own answer in the same letter is that faith comes by hearing
the word of Christ (Romans <b>10</b>:14, 17). This line of thought exemplifies
the importance of separating elements in a causal series. Not every passage
mentions everything involved in a topic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In an omniscient viewpoint, the
distinction between <u>purpose and result</u> tends to disappear as a
consequence of the prescriptive-permissive application of causal series. This
phenomenon appears in John <b>9</b>:3, for instance, when Jesus explains that
the blind man's condition was so “the works of God should be made manifest in
him.” The point seems to be that what had a permissive origin (as the
outworking of natural causes) became an occasion (result) for God’s glorification
through his Son’s miracle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Related to the distinction between
purpose and result is a distinction between <u>chronological and logical</u>
order in association with the doctrine of divine prescience and prior
intention. <i>“As many as were ordained to eternal life believed”</i> (Acts<b>
13</b>:48). Ordination to eternal life was chronologically before, or from, the
foundation of the world (Ephesians <b>1</b>:4; Revelation <b>17</b>:8), as was
the kingdom prepared for the faithful (Matthew <b>25</b>:34) and the laying of
the basis for entering it (Revelation <b>13</b>:8). Calvinism, however, makes
these all logically before as well as chronologically previous. The importance
of saying that these Gentiles were ordained to life is that letting them come
to “the light” (<b>13</b>:47) was in accordance with God’s prior intention
announced in Isaiah <b>49</b>:6. The passage is cited to justify offering the
gospel to Gentiles when the Jews refused it (<b>13</b>:44-46), lest offering it
to them only be seen as corroborative reason for Jews’ decision to disbelieve. Not
only had God determined that Gentiles could come, but in anticipation of their
coming, had ordained them to eternal life. Consequently, the writer indicates
the propriety of turning to the Gentiles in the historical proclamation of the
gospel. Ordination was to eternal life, not to the ability for faith; so the
ordination correlates with faith rather than causes it.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Romans <b>8</b>:7-8 requires a
distinction between natural and circumstantial inability: <i>“The mind of the
flesh is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can it be; and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.” “The mind
of the flesh”</i> is described in <b>8</b>:6a as “death”; it stands for that
system of thinking that does not go beyond the realm of the physical, the
natural, and the temporal—that thinking which is <i>“separated from God.”</i> This
system is antithetical to the “mind of the spirit” in <b>8</b>:5b, for its
outlook on “life” gives precedence to spiritual, supernatural, and eternal concerns.
People operating in the “mind of the flesh” cannot please God, because their
system is opposed to God and stands contrary to God’s spiritual, supernatural,
eternal purposes; they “cannot” be subject to God, because they are in a system
that “is not” subject to God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The apostle is speaking here of an
inability to please God while operating in the system of the flesh; he says
nothing about whether people can change systems. People that are sinners cannot
be pleasing to God, because even the good that they do comes from a
circumstance of imperfection, enmity against God, which they cannot escape by
the nature of the case. The mode of the inability, therefore, is
circumstantial, not natural; the inability is due to the circumstance, not the people.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Earlier in Romans <b>3</b>:12 Paul
quotes Psalm<b> 53</b>:3 as saying, <i>“There is no one that does good, not
even one.”</i> Doing good appears in the beginning of the section where Paul
sets forth perfection as the requirement for fellowship with God. The apostle
takes “good” to mean perfectly good as in the reply of Jesus to the rich young
ruler, <i>“There is none good except God”</i> (Matthew <b>19</b>:17; Mark<b> 10</b>:18;
Luke <b>18</b>:18). Paul does not claim that every act of even a sinner is tainted
by egocentric motives. He means that no human has reached perfect goodness. Such
people cannot do good, although they may do a good, as Jesus says again, <i>“.
. . you, being evil, give good gifts to your children”</i> (Matthew <b>7</b>:11;
Luke <b>11</b>:13; Matthew <b>12</b>:34 is probably an example of tendential
present, <i>“How can you, being evil, [try to] speak good?”</i>). Being once in
a state of imperfection, they cannot do perfect goodness even though they may
do good things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  According to John<b> 6</b>:44, no
one can come to the Son unless the Father draws him. What is propounded here is
not that a supernatural kind of influence must regenerate a degenerate
capacity. Rather, the idea is that no one can come to Jesus except on the
Father’s terms. Men cannot establish the kingdom of God according to their own
designs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  After the feeding of the five
thousand (John<b> 6</b>:1-14), a note appears that Zealot forces, endeavoring
to further their political purposes against Roman occupation, tried to make
Jesus their Messianic king (<b>6</b>:15). The next day a four-stage
confrontation occurred between Jesus and these rebuffed patriots. As an open
challenge to their concept of the Messianic kingdom, Jesus concentrated
attention on his identity with the Father’s will. Anyone coming to the Son must
be willing to adopt the Father’s purpose for his Son. Being drawn by the Father
of the theocratic king equals responding to his program rather than to someone
else’s program—like their own; it also equals responding to the theocratic Son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The political leaders were not in
the circumstance of being drawn by the Father, because they were being drawn by
their own military idols and ideals. Whether they were able in themselves to be
drawn by the Father's purposes differs from whether they were “able” to be
drawn by the Father’s purposes committed as they were to their own. The two
programs being incompatible, they could not operate in the one while being
committed to the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A cluster of images in the gospels
centers around the concept that only good trees bring forth good fruit (Matthew
<b>7</b>:15-20;<b> 12</b>:33-37; Luke<b> 6</b>:43-45; cf. James <b>3</b>:1-12).
Calvinistic interpreters take such statements to mean that there is a correlation
between nature and action. The metaphors indicate, however, a correlation
between inner action and outer action inasmuch as they condemn hypocrisy. The
inner actions of how people intend, think, and feel express themselves
outwardly, because outward behavior arises from inner motives. One person can
often see another’s invisible motives by attending carefully to the person’s
visible actions. Watching “fruit” suggests a long-term observation that detect
the inconsistent living of studied hypocrisy when people try to cover up
(Matthew <b>7</b>:15) their real intentions by good talk (Matthew <b>12</b>:34)
and attempt to sever the necessary connection between inner attitude and
outward behavior. It does not usually take long to “see through” people,
because daily life issues from the unconscious self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The word “create” signifies in its
most basic sense the making of something new. Psalm <b>51</b>:10 says, <i>“Create
in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”</i> Paul has a
similar statement in Ephesians <b>2</b>:10: <i>“. . . created in Christ Jesus
for good works.”</i> The subject of these verses is purifying the heart,
cleansing from sin, or being changed. God is the only one who ultimately can
pronounce a person no longer guilty of a misdeed, for it is against God that
people sin. The creation of a new heart is not a remaking of something marred,
but a cleansing of it and a changing of its functioning and relationships. Creation
in Christ is a change of relationship and a change of standing that result from
a change in pronounced quality of holiness, not from a renewed faculty supplied
to the sinner. People sometimes say, “He makes me mad.” The picture is not one
of passiveness, but of responsiveness. This is a matter of personal influence
that moves another person to action, not a natural creativity. John <b>3</b>:6
uses “born again” as a natural process to speak of a change of spiritual relationship
oriented from above. What is, in fact, an action or a relationship is stated in
substantive terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  God’s giving the Gentiles <u>repentance</u>
unto life (Acts <b>11</b>:18) requires a distinction between <u>state and
action</u>. Calvinists misapply the law of opposition at this point; because
the context deals with the contrast between Gentiles and Jews, not with a
contrast between repentance as done vs. repentance as given. The Lucan
expression means that eternal life is open to Gentiles as well as to Jews on
the condition of repentance, because God has made his repentance-unto-life
possibility available to them as well as to Jews (Luke <b>23</b>:47; Acts <b>5</b>:31;
cf. 2 Corinthians <b>7</b>:10).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The intent is not that God needs to
give Gentiles the <u>ability</u> to repent, but the <u>opportunity</u> to
repent unto salvation. Repentance is not a gift received as distinguished from
something done, but an opportunity given for repentance to have salvific value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Ephesians<b> 2</b>:8 in English
translation may appear to indicate that <u>faith</u> is given in such a way as
not to be from the person, <i>“By grace you are saved through faith and that
not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.”</i> The word “that” is neuter, not
feminine, and cannot refer to the feminine word<i> </i>“faith” as its grammatical
antecedent. Instead, “that” points to the impersonal idea in the verb:
salvation.</span></p>

his own people did not accept him”</i> (John<i> </i><b>1</b>:11). The next
sentence reads, <i>“. . . but as many as did receive him . . .”</i> As a rule,
the Jewish people refused their Messiah, but thousands did believe. What is
stated as a fact is only in reality a general rule (cp. John <b>3</b>:33-34;
Ephesians <b>5</b>:29 + 2 Timothy <b>1</b>:15-18).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  This last linguistic mechanism
combines with others in the case of 1 Corinthians <b>2</b>:14: “Now the natural
human beings do not receive the things of the Spirit of God because they are
foolishness to them; and they cannot know them because they are spiritually
discerned.” First, the reader must understand what Paul means by “natural human
being.” “Natural human being” does not mean “unregenerate human being”
particularly, for the preceding context does not discuss people’s fallen
nature, but the circumstance of people without a revelation of the mystery (1
Corinthians <b>2</b>:7). A natural human being is one unaided by revelation from
the supernatural through the Spirit. Paul makes a similar use of “nature” in
Romans <b>2</b>:14 as he speaks of people without revelation doing “by nature”
the things of God; the origin of what they do is within their own educated
conscience as it sometimes leads them in behavior that God wants, but which
they have not been told about by special revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Paul has a similar thing in mind in
1 Corinthians <b>2</b>, because he is speaking of the mystery that had not been
known in the world (<b>2</b>:7-9) and that had only recently been made known (<b>2</b>:10a).
Human wisdom could not discover the means of salvation, because it had no
access to the mind of God, who determined the foundation of salvation (<b>2</b>:8).
Nobody would ever have thought that a dead man could be a means of salvation
unto life; such a thing was foolishness to philosophers (<b>2</b>:8; <b>1</b>:18,
23) and a stumbling block to Jews who anticipated an eternal political Messiah
(<b>2</b>:8; <b>1</b>:22-23). Unless people have access to the mind of God, they
cannot know what God is planning (<b>2</b>:9-11) any more than one person can
tell what another person is thinking. People know only their own thoughts;
likewise, only God (“the Spirit of God”) knows his own thoughts till he reveals
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Because natural human beings are those
who do not have access to supernatural thoughts, they cannot know them. The
word <i>know</i> in the original is aorist and should be taken as an ingressive
aorist, “come to know,” since the preceding material treats the divine
origination of this knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The mind of God is examined by the
Spirit of God and must be understood in reference to a spiritual system. The
thoughts of God are put in human language; things of spiritual origin are
expressed in words that can carry spiritual content (1 Corinthians <b>2</b>:13).
Paul does not say that people cannot learn these things when God teaches them, but
that they cannot come to know them without God’s teaching them through
revelation; they cannot find them out any other way. Consequently, 1
Corinthians <b>2</b>:14b is not speaking of the nature of human beings at all,
but of the nature of their ignorance; they are dependent on revelation to come
to a knowledge of the will of God. That revelation is by the Spirit, whose
message Paul identified as what he was preaching. By philosophy, however, comes
not salvation, but lostness, as he declares elsewhere in Romans 1.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In 1 Corinthians<b> 2</b>:14a Paul
says that people accustomed to solving their problems with reason and wisdom as
the ultimate court of appeals, do not as a rule welcome things not learned
through wisdom. The idea is not logically derived and therefore not
intellectually sophisticated. That this generalization is true need not be
denied; there are few such philosophical people effectually called because they
seek not to listen, but to discover for themselves that they may glory at the
shrewdness of their discovery (1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:26-27). It is more
prestigious to discover than to be told, to be able to find out for oneself
than to ask or be instructed. These kinds of people tend also to distrust the
word of other people. Though they may not welcome or eagerly accept the
testimony of others, they can do so and sometimes do so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>“Dead through trespasses and
sins”</i> in Ephesians 2 is often allegorized into meaning <i>“insensible to
spiritual matters.” </i>It is true that a corpse is insensible to its physical
surroundings, but to compare lostness to death does not mean that every element
associated with death is to be associated with lostness. A comparison requires a
parallel only on specific connections. For example, one does not ask of the
figure <i>“Christ paid the ransom”</i> to whom he paid it. That is not the
reason for using the figure. Christ’s work and paying a ransom are alike in the
respect that recipients are in a state of utter dependence and cannot bring
about their own release.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the same way in this passage, death
means <i>“separation from God.”</i> To be <i>“dead” </i>to something is to lack
cognizance of it; to be alive to something is to be <i>“with it.” </i>Lack of
cognizance being the intent of comparison, Paul says nothing about the ability
of cognizance. Conversely, to be dead to the world is to lack awareness of its
allurements in any participational sense of knowing it, even as being dead to
God means to lack awareness of his promptings in any participational,
responsive, or obedient sense of knowing him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  An exegetical impasse exists on
passages that deal directly with anthropology. To dialogue with the
Augustinian-Calvinistic concept of natural depravity, one must adopt the
biblical-systematic approach, establish the points of the great dilemma

biblical bases and philosophical presuppositions of Calvinism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

hermeneutical program whose direction is suggested by the observation that the Satan
terminology for human activity parallels the God terminology Calvinism takes strictly.
Among linguistic mechanisms relevant to these cases are the tendencies (1) to
streamline causal distinctions; (2) to interchange nature, state, and actions
terms; and (3) to state generalities as absolutes, which set up the danger of
allegorizing the comparison during interpretation.</span></p>

signifies the same circumstantial sense that, seeking the glory of <u>people</u>
<u>opposed to God</u>, people are not able to believe unto receiving the glory
of <u>God</u>. There is a logical incompatibility in the two programs of believing
people and believing God. People must let go of the one to take hold of the
other; whether they are able to let go and to take hold is a different question
from whether they can take hold without first letting go. 1 John <b>3</b>:9
clearly means circumstantial inability. To this class also belongs Jesus’
comment in John <b>15</b>:5, <i>“Without me you can do nothing.”</i> People
must abide in Jesus before what they do will have any significance attached to
it; and if Jesus abides in them, they will be producing the fruit of that
abiding, because they will be doing things they <u>would not</u> be doing
without that influence. Interpersonal influence is not such that people must
