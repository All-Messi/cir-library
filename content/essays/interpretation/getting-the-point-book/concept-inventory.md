For interpreters to do their work properly, they must be able to bring to the text an awareness of as many linguistic and conceptual features as appear and are presupposed in the materials they are trying to understand. Jesus’ hearers in John <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:34-36 wondered whether he would go among the Gentiles or Diasporic Jews when he said, <em>“You cannot go where I am going.”</em> They could not understand him because in their minds they did not have the possibility of Messiah’s ascension to heaven. The same thing happened with the Sadducees when they presented Jesus with the problem about a woman married to seven brothers in succession. They did not understand the power of God to generate new possibilities beyond what they could already conceive of on the basis of past experience.

Below are concepts we need in our concept inventory in order to think clearly. Deficiencies in our concept inventory cause us to make equivocations of unlike, but superficially similar, things. We “bend” the unknown into our known (equivocation); we “fudge” the unfamiliar into a familiar “pigeon hole.” What happens is reminiscent of (1) a little kid hearing the word <em>concubine</em> and thinking she heard “cucumber vine.” She fudged the unknown sound over into a known one. (2) A word that has a second meaning cannot be heard by people who know only one meaning. In their mind they supply the one meaning they know in place of the one the speaker meant, and confusion results—often without their ever suspecting they are confused. The same kind of thing can happen with (3) concepts. People can “make distinction without a difference” as well as not distinguish unlike things.

Many concepts below are clustered together for comparison and contrast with the hope that such an arrangement fosters greater clarity.


Typical language categories: identity (who, what), quality, time (when), direction (logical, chronological), location (where), means, manner (how), frequency/number, cause/purpose/result (why), condition/concession. Manner in adverbs and verbs corresponds with kind in adjectives and nouns as shown by the practice of deriving adverbs of manner (quickly) from adjectives (quick).


absolute (continuous) <em>vs.</em> decisive

To make something a decisive factor does not make it the monolithic/single

characteristic or factor in the whole.


universal <em>vs.</em> absolute: universal means everywhere or in all cases; absolute deal with

highest degree.


permissive <em>vs.</em> prescriptive (will, for example)

what is allowed (coming from elsewhere) <em>vs.</em> what is specific (coming from within)


prescriptive/ought <em>vs.</em> descriptive/is


descriptive <em>vs.</em> evaluative

making known the character of something <em>vs.</em> expressing opinion as to good ro bad, effective or ineffective, and the like.


primary proof <em>vs. </em>confirmatory evidence

what leads to a conclusion <em>vs.</em> what fits with a conclusion


straight-line causal series, reciprocation/interdependency, compenetration, transaction,

dialectic/thesis-antithesis-synthesis


In the context of personal relationships, transaction means that in the very process of one person's relating to the other the first is shaped by the relating. For example, in explaining something to the other person, a speaker formulates a way of wording or modeling it, which very process shapes the speaker’s own way of viewing the matter and perhaps clarifies it.


objective-subjective


The difference between objective and subjective is not clear-cut. If toothpaste or some food makes a person gag, it could be said that it “was all in his head” because of the way he was looking at it. While that is true, the fact that he is looking at it that way is objective to someone else; even more so, the fact that it is gagging him is objective. After all, that is the reason the subjective is so important. Even if religion were only the subjective dimension, it would be important because it impacts the objective (other people, <em>etc</em>.).

To some extent interpersonalism transcends the objective-subjective distinction, because reciprocal relationship involves both people simultaneously and interdependently. Reciprocal relationship, interdependency, compenetration blur the objective-subjective variable.


distinctive <em>vs.</em> most important

The Lord’s Supper may be the most distinctive element in a Christian stated gathering

without being the most important.

Sexual relationship is the distinctive of marriage, but it may not be the most important

aspect of a good marriage.


“necessary” can be in different senses: interpersonally, legally, naturally, logically

These areas can include appropriate (need to do “this” to avoid being misunderstood,

for example)


necessary <em>vs.</em> sufficient cause


necessary <em>vs</em>. possible


direct and indirect causation


cause, conditionality, contingency, effect/result


Under cause, A produces B; under correlation, A and B both vary relative to x. Contingency is popularly expressed by saying that something is “the function of” something else. (a) Correlation means seeing two things as belonging together—as forming a set. (b) Correlation may imply coextensiveness, but not necessarily. (c) Correlation means varying together; the second and the first are a function of a third, more basic matter.


purpose <em>vs.</em> result

Result is what arises from something before it; purpose is the intent to bring about that

result.


contrary <em>vs.</em> contradictory (= different <em>vs.</em> opposed)


causation <em>vs.</em> correlation


parallel <em>vs</em>. serial


logical relationships:	overlapping categories

parallel categories

part-to-whole relationship (and <em>vice versa</em>)

coextensive

part + part to make whole

(James’ use of “faith” and “works”)


positive, neutral, negative


deductive <em>vs.</em> inductive

Deductive refers to working backward from a conclusion or full picture to the unvoiced

parts or causes that make it up or lead to it.


category and continuum


Category and continuum can relate in the process of change. For one thing, degrees can exist within the categories. In interpersonal relationships (and belief changes), what happens is that more and more experiences “pressure” against the ceiling (or right end of one category in the overall continuum) until psychologically as well as objectively a “conversion” into the next category occurs. These “points” in a process are “direction-setting events/experiences,” “the straw that broke the camel’s back,” “decision points.”

Under continuum belong duration (time), degree (kind), distance (space)


analog <em>vs.</em> digital


number <em>vs.</em> degree parallels category <em>vs.</em> continuum


general and particular


freedom within a framework; a larger frame of reference can qualify a statement.

part and whole (note <em>gestalt</em>)

various “levels” (within a category)


restrictive and nonrestrictive


word <em>vs.</em> concept <em>vs</em>. reality


general <em>vs.</em> absolute


theory and practice


prohibited, permitted, required


potential <em>vs.</em> actual


absolute and relative


(inherently) necessary <em>vs</em>. appropriate (= what is required by <em>vs.</em> what fits/harmonizes with)


cp. positive commandment<em> vs</em>. moral law


commandment/prohibition <em>vs.</em> advice


logical necessity (consistency and deductive) <em>vs.</em> natural necessity <em>vs.</em> moral

necessity


impossible/possible <em>vs.</em> not necessarily/necessarily


positive <em>vs.</em> restrictive


qualitative <em>vs. </em>quantitative


identity <em>vs.</em> quality


kind <em>vs.</em> degree


intuitive <em>vs.</em> discursive


reality/example <em>vs.</em> analogy/comparison/illustration


same/comparison/like <em>vs.</em> similar/identity/is (proportion of shared characteristics)


legal/law <em>vs.</em> natural/nature/being/ontic-being <em>vs.</em> ideal/metaphysical <em>vs.</em> symbolic


impersonal <em>vs.</em> personal <em>vs.</em> interpersonal


consistent <em>vs.</em> circular


being, action, and relationship


Meaning is a relational concept. What something means may be (a) the referent of a

word, (b) what leads to a subsequent fact or act, (c) what is tantamount to.


idea <em>vs</em>. reality


nothing and something


particular <em>vs.</em> general


(continuous <em>vs.</em> iterative/repetitive, cyclical, characteristic) <em>vs.</em> punctiliar


inner <em>vs.</em> outer (internal <em>vs. </em>external)


impelled from within <em>vs.</em> compelled from without

overt <em>vs.</em> covert: visible to others <em>vs. </em>not visible to others

consistent and correlative

futurum <em>vs.</em> adventus: futurum leads to the next by internal causation; adventus

leads to a change from external causation.


cyclical <em>vs.</em> linear <em>vs.</em> spiral


As a historical pattern linear involves the new (<em>novum</em>), which means creativity, while cyclical means simply moving back and forth between the old options that have always been and will never increase.


monism <em>vs.</em> dualism <em>vs.</em> pluralism


monistic (of one kind/part), dualistic (of two kinds/parts), pluralistic (of many

kinds/parts)


in parallel <em>vs. </em>in series


simple <em>vs.</em> complex


Simple means there is one or relatively few aspects to the whole; complex means there are many and perhaps that there are varying degrees in some of the aspects rather than plus or minus. Uniform throughout <em>vs</em>. different aspects or parts.


form and content/meaning and function


McLuhen’s concept that the medium is the message relates to, and qualifies, the form-meaning distinction.


parallel and serial


parsimonious—simplest explanation, what can serve as an underlying explanation for a variety of particulars


manner, means, agency, condition, concession, time (during, at, extent), place (direction toward and from, location), frequency/number, quantity, nature/kind/quality, identity, purpose, result, attendant circumstance, correlative circumstance


discrete <em>vs.</em> relational


Discrete <em>vs</em>. relational occurs on the subjective side as to whether a thing is thought of in itself or in connection with other things called context, environment, surroundings, and the like.


I <em>vs</em>. other


the one and the many (singular and plural)


descriptive<em> vs</em>. evaluative vs. prescriptive


distinctive and primary; peculiar and most important


faith, fact, opinion

Faith means what is integral to one viewpoint; fact means what is true but does not bear on the character and function of a viewpoint; opinion refers to an idea that has insufficient basis.


same, <em>vs</em>. like (similar) <em>vs</em>. different (as to kind)
