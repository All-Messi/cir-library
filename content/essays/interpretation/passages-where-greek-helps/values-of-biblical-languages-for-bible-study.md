<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Knowing biblical languages does not leave
you so much at the mercy of translations. One disadvantage of having to work
through a translation is that (a) <u>no two languages match up exactly</u>. A
vocabulary item in one language seldom has the same range of denotations and
connotations as the closest corresponding word(s) in another. The same thing
applies to phrases, sentences, word endings, and particularly idioms, a culture’s
customary usages of its language’s mechanisms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A second disadvantage of using a
translation is that (b) <u>translation and interpretation are inseparable</u>. Translators
cannot translate what they do not understand. If a group of translators does
not properly understand certain doctrinal concepts, that distinctive viewpoint
will find expression in their work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Since languages do not match up exactly,
three values of biblical language study can be pictured by overlapping circles.
First, (1) <u>knowing the original languages eliminates some ways of
understanding the English wording</u>. In the accompanying diagram the shaded
area represents interpretations of the English wording that do not fit with the
meaning of   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                        <img

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>the original text. These misinterpretations can come
from the reader’s making something out of the wording that even the translators
did not intend. For example, an English reader might try to distinguish between
“eternal” and “everlasting,” not realizing that these words are two
translations for the same Greek or Hebrew term. On the basis of archaic
translations, many teachers have misused Paul’s statement to Timothy to “<u>study</u>
to show yourself approved”; “study” means to give diligence, not to “study” a
book, as we use the word today. Many preachers have sought to magnify the
preaching ministry by reference to <i>“the foolishness of preaching”</i> in 1
Corinthians <b>1</b>:21, when the point of the text has to do with the
foolishness of <i>“the preached thing”</i> (the message).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Second, (2) <u>knowing the original
languages brings up possibilities an English translation would not suggest</u>.
English cannot reproduce all the possibilities that the first language contains.
Once translators decide which option to use, the English reader is cut off from
any other</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                        <img
width=202 height=111 src="/cir-library/images/essays/values-of-biblical-languages-for-bible-study/image002.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>possibility except in cases where an alternate
rendering appears in the margin or in a footnote.                 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since languages do not match up in their
level of specificness, among “new possibilities” may be included the fact that
the original author was not expressing as exact an idea as English options
force translators to use. The translators’ task is not, then, a matter of
choosing between options so much as it is a matter of being forced—at least by
preferred English idiom—to speak more precisely or loosely than the original.
In so doing, they may unwittingly express something that really comes out of their
own biases.  Furthermore, the original author may not have been expressing as
exact an idea as translators and commentators have typically assumed (<i>e.g</i>.,
Romans <b>9</b>:22<i>—“vessels fitted/fitted-themselves/<u>fit</u> for
destruction”—</i>or Hebrews <b>6</b>:4—“<i>because they recrucify the Son/while
they recrucify the Son/<u>recrucifying, as they are,</u> the Son”</i>). Perhaps
an idea is biblical—that is, expressed elsewhere directly or at least
necessarily implied, but it does not belong to this passage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since languages do not match up exactly,
(3) <u>knowing the original languages helps regain nuances that are lost in
translation</u>. Even if there is nothing incorrect, misleading, or                      
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                             <img
width=134 height=80 src="/cir-library/images/essays/values-of-biblical-languages-for-bible-study/image003.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>apparently unclear about a passage in translation,
something of the richness and flavor of the writing may be lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (4) <u>Knowing the original
languages puts at your disposal study tools that you cannot use profitably
without knowing the original languages.</u> Under this observation we can include
more advanced commentaries. You will not understand their discussions of
grammatical points and the bearing of those points on the meaning of a passage,
and you will not see how two or three quite divergent ideas could possibly come
from the same Greek or Hebrew statement. Other tools include Greek concordances
and lexicons (dictionaries) as well as Kittel’s <i>Theological Dictionary of
the New Testament</i> and the like. Using only an English concordance on the
word <i>love</i>, for instance, gets only those places where the Greek word </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀγάπη</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> is
translated “love.” It misses cases where it might be rendered “charity” or “like.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (5) <u>Knowing the original languages puts
you in a better position to evaluate what other people say the Greek “really
means.”</u> They sometimes like to create a scholarly impression by telling you
what the Greek says. They remove the possibility of discussion by appealing to
something most people are not in a position to handle.  How many times have you
heard someone say that the Great Commission really says, <i>“<u>As you go</u>,
make disciples”</i>? Someone, somewhere heard enough to know that a Greek
participle can replace a clause and that it may have the value of progressive
action. What that person did not know was the difference between aorist- and
present-tense participles. “As you go” would be a possibility in Matthew <b>28</b>
if the participle were present, but it is aorist and joined to an aorist
imperative, which gives it an imperatival force, because the participle picks
up the mood value of the associate finite verb.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This observation applies to preachers,
teachers, and others in everyday oral settings.  It applies as well to written
tools like commentaries and theological studies. It applies to Bible versions
themselves. You may note that translations differ in a certain passage, but
without knowing the original languages you are not in much of a position to
choose which is correct or best. Neither can you stand above commentaries and
other study tools that you use. Either you have to let it pass—probably the
wisest course—or you risk being misled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (6) Knowing the original languages has the
more generalized value of making you aware of how languages work, which has a
subtle and therefore important impact on <u>interpretation</u>. The study of
any foreign language has this value. When people are not exposed to any
language but their own, they has no vantage point from which to see how
languages can differ. Consequently, they have no basis for appreciating the
kinds of problems that exist in going from one language to another or for
appreciating the fact that other phenomena do exist besides the ones in their
own language. Studying foreign languages helps untie them from the linguistic
peculiarities of their mother tongue, peculiarities they are not consciously
aware of until they see that other languages do not have them or have different
ones.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Untying ourselves from our own language also has an
important impact on <u>thinking</u>.  Correct thinking deals with reality, but
language is always something expressed from the subjective side. Therefore,
proper thinking demands that we not confuse language and the reality it points
to. Linear and punctiliar action, for instance, is a distinction we make in
mind; it is not a difference in the “length” of the action itself. <i>“I washed
the car”</i> and <i>“I was washing the car”</i> can both be said about the same
case. Theological distinctions about the reality of salvation, or whatever,
should not be based on such verbal differences, but people not astute about the
way language functions constantly make erroneous inferences from such things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our comments on the value of biblical
language study assume knowing Greek and Hebrew rather well. Like most other
areas of learning, languages become dangerous tools if they are misused. “Pop
theology” gets started by people that know just enough to make them dangerous. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If you do not know Greek or Hebrew, there
are some things you can do to help compensate. First, you must use a modern
translation. You may not realize that certain phraseology is archaic. (Note the
“study” and “preaching” illustrations above.) Secondly, you can compare
translations to locate places where translators vary in how they think the text
should be rendered. Third, commentaries you can consult sometimes discuss these
differences in ways the English-only reader may not understand. If you know even
the Greek and Hebrew alphabets, you have access to study tools organized
alphabetically. But you must remember that meaning is much more than a
vocabulary matter. Failure to observe this point creates a lot of bogus
exegesis, which contributes again to the problem of “pop theology.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             In a four-year undergraduate program, it
is not easy to study both Greek and Hebrew—at least in much depth. Consequently,
Christian colleges prioritize Greek because of the more direct connection
between Christianity and the New Testament. Aramaic is seldom offered at all
since only a small portion of the Old Testament is written in that language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            While emphasizing the importance of
original-language study, we do not want to claim too much for it. It does not
provide the answer to all exegetical problems. The common claim that Greek is
the most precise language that ever existed is a notion that is not
linguistically sound. A language is precise relative to the purposes of the
culture that uses it. When you ask about how good a language is, you have to
ask, <i>“Good about what?”</i> In general, Greek is probably not as precise as
English. There are a number of ambiguous points in the language. One is caused
by its love for participles, and participles may cover for time, means, manner,
cause, condition, concession, purpose, result, coordinate circumstance,
accompanying circumstance, and other concepts. Another point of ambiguity lies
in the use of the genitive case, which often can come into English as an “of”
expression. In many circumstances all the genitive case does is tie one noun to
another; <u>how</u> the referents of those nouns really relate has to be
determined by the law of harmony, the law of contrast, and the nature of the
case. While many biblical issues can be settled aside from a knowledge of the
original languages, some cannot be settled any other way.</span></p>
