has progressed around the daisy outline to the model prayer. We discussed <b>6</b>:1-18
under the heading of hypocrisy. The accompanying diagram shows how the model
prayer fits inside that larger portion. Jesus’ comments about giving, prayer,
and fasting follow a pattern that includes “they have their reward,” doing
their alms, praying and fasting “in secret,” and <i>“your Father will reward
you openly.”</i> His statements about prayer lead into the “model prayer,” a
subset in</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'> this</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> format for <b>6</b>:1-18.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>This</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'> chapter studies the model prayer in connection with worship because prayer
is an example of worship—perhaps the most distinctive example of it. Starting
with a definition of worship, we line up parts of the definition with aspects
of prayer and with features of the model prayer. “Worship is conscious
self-expression to God as a present superior second person.” Substituting “prayer”
for “worship,” the statement becomes, <i>“Prayer is conscious self-expression
to God as a present superior second person.” </i>Each term of that statement
explains prayer and correlates with something Jesus includes in his model for
prayer.  Worship is a special kind of communication; so prayer is a special
kind of communication; at least in modern English, “prayer” refers to
communication with deity in contrast to communication with people. Worship and
prayer are vertically directed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  First, prayer is <u>conscious</u>.
Jesus does not elaborate what he means by “vain repetition,” but he does say
that Gentiles do it because they think they will be heard “for their much
speaking.” “Vain repetition” can mean offering prayers again and again
ritualistically without much heartfelt meaning, doing it routinely at scheduled
times, doing it automatically in certain circumstances, following certain rigid
formats, or repeating phrases over and over. If worship requires attention, our
minds must be “on.” Prayer is not something we can do without concentrating on
it—without thinking about it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer as <u>self-expression</u>
is also important because self-expression brings our character into the picture.
Vain repetition is foreign to that because “vain” means “empty,” which amounts
to “meaningless” when applied to communication. When things are done over and
over and over, they tend to become meaningless, because habit starts taking
over.  This problem can be illustrated by repeating a word over and over and
over. After “book, book, book, book, book” is said fifteen or twenty times, it
becomes a mere sound. We are not thinking anything; therefore, we are not
investing the word with meaning; therefore, it has no meaning. That is the
problem with any repeated, habitual activity; it is no less a problem with
communication.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  For this reason we
must be careful about using “canned prayers”—prayers repeated at every meal, at
every bedtime, at every invocation in church, at every gathering around the
Lord’s table. Recitation sounds as if the ideas really originate elsewhere, and
we are just taking the words and running them through our vocalizers. Even the
model prayer itself can become a problem.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                   We are not so much
objecting to memorized prayer as voicing concern that in prayer we express <u>ourselves</u>
to God. This same concern applies to read prayers. Prayers written ahead of
time can be read almost without thinking. That does not have to be the case,
but reading prayers lends itself to abuses. Seldom do we read our thoughts to
other people even though we can do it and do it meaningfully. Self-expression
belongs in prayer because prayer is a form of communication in worship.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Self-expression
includes our character, and the personal character we express in prayer affects
the quality of prayer. The important thing about the quality of prayer is not
the quality of its form but of its content. The issue is not how well we word
the prayer or how beautifully we deliver it. As James <b>5</b>:16 says, <i>“The
supplication of a <u>righteous</u> man avails much in its working.”</i> Not
only does righteous character enhance the validity of prayer, but it affects
its results. James<b> 5</b>:16 implies that who we are is involved in every
form of our approach to God, but it expressly applies to our approach to him in
worship and prayer.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Isaiah <b>6</b>
illustrates the same point. Isaiah is in the temple when in a vision he sees
God for who he really is in glory and righteousness. God’s nature immediately
reflects on the prophet: “Woe is me because I am a man of unclean lips and I
live among people just like me.” But even with our relative unholiness and
unrighteousness we can come into God’s holy presence. The point is that when we
do so in worship, we express who we are even in our inner selves, and God
overlooks any defects if our hearts are right (Isaiah <b>6</b>:5-7). Worship
before an all-knowing God is not something external that can be taken care of
simply as a matter of form.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Conscious
self-expression differs from self-negation. The ideal in worship is not to get
rid of ourselves and create a vacuum so God can fill it. He does not want to
get us out of the way so he can replace us. He created us for relationship; so
what he wants to do is relate to us, which would not be happening if in prayer
we become nothing to let him be everything. As a result, we do not strive for a
sense of nothingness in prayer experiences lest our worship become vain and
contentless.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer is
self-expression to <u>God</u>. The model prayer accompanies Jesus’ criticism of
people who display righteousness so people can see them. Their prayers, alms,
and fasting were aimed</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:red'> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>at </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>the wrong audience. Prayer should be directed to God. Whoever is in our
hearing to say “Amen” can indeed “listen in,” but we do not pray toward them as
second persons. We pray to him who sees us in secret or in public.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer is
self-expression to God as a <u>present</u> person. This aspect of prayer may
relate to “vain repetition” again. We can suppose that Jesus had in mind
incidents like that of the Baal prophets on Mount Carmel (1 Kings <b>18</b>). God’s
prophet Elijah and his fellow prophets made fun of the Baal prophets because
they carried on all day yelling and cutting themselves with stones. Such
behavior conceives of God as very distant, existing somewhere beyond the
farthest star or traveling on a journey without our knowing he is gone. Under
those conditions we could not easily get his attention, and he might not even
care that much about our plight. Consequently, we would have to beg him to pay
attention and listen to our needs.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  That is not the
correct picture of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>God</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. We think of him as present with us, especially in
the Christian age, because he has given us his Spirit to be with us and in us
(John <b>14</b>:17). We are not orphans with an absentee Father (John <b>14</b>:18).
Since God’s Spirit is with us, we do not have to go find him, get his
attention, or beg him. <i>“Vain repetition”</i> and <i>“much speaking”</i> are
not necessary.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>“Our Father in
heaven”</i> does not controvert this sense of his presence. First, being “in
heaven” contrasts with limited to earth. He is “transcendent,” above all things.
“Heaven” does not so much imply distance as different order of being. God does
not have our limitations. Second, he knows everything, including our hearts; so
we can serve him “in secret” and still be rewarded openly. Even if it is
appropriate to speak of God as “located” far away, wherever he “is” his
omniscience makes him fully aware of our needs and prayers.  Thirdly, God’s
Spirit is with us. We do not have to strain to get to the “Father who is in
heaven.” He takes the initiative to contact us. We have then a sense of God’s
presence with us even though we address him as “our Father in heaven.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer is
self-expression to God as a <u>superior</u> person. “Superior” relates to
humility before God in prayer. The model prayer begins with an acknowledgment
of God’s exalted position and nature. This emphasis corresponds with the word
translated “worship,” which contains the word picture of “bending the knee
toward”—as when a person kneels in respect and homage in front of someone. “Hallowed”
expresses respect and homage toward God.  We could translate it <i>“be
sanctified”</i> or <i>“be set apart from all others.”</i> The worshiper puts
God in a class by himself. We recognize his hallowedness and sanctity by seeing
ourselves in a category beneath him. Prayer is a conscious self-expression to
God as a present superior second person.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer is
self-expression to God as a <u>second</u> person. “Second person” means more
than the fact that he is another person. We mean “second person” in a
grammatical sense in contrast to first or third person. First person is “I” and
“we”—the speaker(s). Second person is “you” singular and plural—the one(s)
spoken to. Third person is “he/she/it or they,” the one(s) spoken about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The model prayer says,
<i>“May <u>your</u> name be hallowed.”</i> In prayer we talk <u>to</u> God. That
is so simple and yet so important. Prayer is not to be confused with related
things. Prayer, for example, is not <u>meditation</u>, because meditation deals
with ideas in the third person. We do not talk to ideas and ideas do not talk
to us. We think <u>about</u> them. Though good and important, meditation is not
even communication, much less communication to someone. Prayer is something we
do with another person in an I-you relationship.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer is not <u>communion</u>.
We are not talking here about the Lord’s Supper, but about the sense of having
someone around. For instance, a person might see a light under the door to the
next room and hear people walking around in there. He would feel associated
with them,&nbsp;but would not be talking to them. Such “communion” with God is
fine; it is important to have a strong sense of God’s real presence; but we
should differentiate between prayer and that sense of real presence. Prayer
does not just commune with the other person; it communicates to the person.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer is also not <u>benediction</u>,
a “good word” of dismissal or blessing pronounced on the assembly of worshipers.
In this case the worship leader is talking to the audience, but prayer is
directed toward God. If we dismiss an assembly with a benediction, we do not
bow our heads and close our eyes as if in prayer, because we are addressing the
audience rather than God. If we are leading the audience, it is our word to
them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A familiar prayer for
kids says, <i>“God is great, God is good, and we thank <u>him</u> for our food.”</i>
It is a nice rhyme, but it is not a prayer. It is a statement that one person
would make to another about God, not what he would say to God. It could be
changed into a prayer by saying, <i>“You are great, you are good, and we thank
you for our food.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The last element in
the definition of prayer is that it is self-expression to God as a second <u>person</u>.
“I” as a person am speaking to God as a person. Consequently, prayer is
interpersonal and serves as our central orienting experience in life.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The context of the
model prayer brings up three problems associated with prayer. The first problem
is the need for prayer: “Your Father knows what you need before you ask him” (<b>6</b>:8).
Similarly, <b>6</b>:31-32 says, “Do not be anxious, saying, ‘What are we going
to eat?’ or <i>‘What are we going to drink?’ or</i> <i>‘What are we going to
wear?’ . . . because your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.”</i>
Why tell God what he already knows? Perhaps we have twisted the point somewhat
by the way we posed the question. <u>Prayer is not so much to inform God as to
glorify him</u>. The potatoes we eat we buy with money we earn, but God
ultimately supplies potatoes. We may even plant them and take care of them, but
he created them and made them able to grow; he sends sunshine and rain that
make them grow. He is creator and sustainer; we only enter into his labors. Consequently,
by our requests we glorify God by recognizing him as the source of everything we
enjoy.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Furthermore, even
though he knows our needs before we ask, we still ask him to benefit us. It is
one thing for God to know we need something; it is another thing for him to
supply it to us. A young man may want a young lady to marry him and she may be
able to tell, but she does not say “yes” till he asks. We receive many things
as a matter of course, but not everything is like sunshine and rain. <u>Prayer
is not to inform God but to benefit us</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The second question
about prayer is why we need to pray if God gives his benefits anyway. The model
prayer asks for daily food and<b> 5</b>:45 says that God sends rain and
sunshine on his enemies, who do not pray to him, as well as his on friends who
do. Why pray for what comes without prayer? Prayer may not be <u>necessary</u>
for getting something, but it is nevertheless <u>appropriate</u> for getting it.
As we said before, asking God for what normally comes anyway glorifies him. What
normally happens, however, may not happen every time. There can be famine. Because
of prayer for food God may intervene to change what nature would have done if
he had let it take its course. When we pray for what God regularly gives, we
glorify him as the source. When we pray for what he does not regularly give, we
receive additionally according to his discretion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Prayer is not so
much for changing God as for changing us</u>. Even if there were no objective
difference because we prayed, there could be important subjectively differences
because we did. Most people have had the experience of asking a question only
to have the answer come to mind as they ask. The very process of putting
problems into words helps us understand what we are putting into words. Life’s
questions can solve themselves in the process of prayer. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer also finalizes
things. It puts closure on them. As long as some idea, proposal, or commitment
is bouncing around inside your mind, it remains only a possibility. But as soon
as you say something about it, it becomes a real proposal or commitment. That
is a whole different ball game. Saying something to God is like signing your
name on the dotted line.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Prayer brings release.
Something about simply talking through our problems seems to reduce their size.
That is one contribution counselors make to their clients; they listen. When a
person talks through his difficulties, they become more manageable
psychologically. For a similar reason we ask even if God would have given
without being asked. We ask even for what he gives to all men. We ask for what
might not have come without asking. Prayer glorifies God, prayer changes
things, but more importantly prayer changes us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A third question about
prayer is unique to the model prayer. What does Jesus mean by saying, <i>“Do
not lead us into temptation”</i>? Does God lead us into temptation? James <b>1</b>:13
says, “God does not tempt any man.” The answer to this problem lies in the way
scripture uses language. Hebrew idiom is not always like English idiom. For
example, according to Job <b>1-2 </b><u>Satan</u> brought many calamities on
Job, but <b>42</b>:11 speaks of all those evils as things that <u>God</u>
brought on Job. Similarly, God tempts us by letting Satan tempt us. In a manner
of speaking, God leads us into temptation in that he allows temptation to come
our way. “Allowing” and “causing” are not always distinguished in the biblical
use of Semitic idiom, but they are different in reality.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Jesus’ model prayer
serves as a model for our prayer. We do not meaninglessly repeat it time and
again, but use it as a guide for prayer elements and personal attitudes in
worshipping God through prayer.  </span></p>
