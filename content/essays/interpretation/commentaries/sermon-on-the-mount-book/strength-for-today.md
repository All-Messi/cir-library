<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Matthew <b>6</b>:19-34
gives us an opportunity to use a simple method of Bible study. It consists of
asking a question and reading scripture with an eye for answers. We may be
surprised at how often scripture addresses such questions. Familiar scriptures
take on a fresh light because new experiences establish a new context for
seeing new applications. The answers were not noticed before because we were
not prepared for them. Matthew <b>6</b> offers insights into matters we never
thought the Bible even addressed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  This study of Matthew <b>6</b>:19-34
asks how we can get the strength to deal with life.  The question is not about
physical strength but about mental and emotional strength—the ability to cope
with frustration, fragmentation, insecurity, disorientation. Life forces us
into situations bigger than we are. Does scripture teach us how to handle such
problems? These verses in the Sermon on the Mount have implications for
psychological strength. Of course, there are other items of interest here as
well, but our study focuses on five principles that enhance a person’s power to
cope. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  First, <u>spend
resources on eternal things</u>. This advice comes from <b>6</b>:19-21:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Don’t lay up treasure on earth where moths and rust
consume and thieves break in and steal, but lay up treasure in heaven where
moths and rust do not ruin them and thieves do not break in and steal them. Your
heart will be where your treasure is.  </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>To have strength, we have to expend
ourselves on things that last—on eternal things, in fact.  Frustration so often
comes from getting wrapped up in pursuits that take up time, talent, and
treasure far out of proportion to their minimal returns.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In America young men
like cars. They buy them, fix them up, shine them up, and spend a lot of time
driving them around. In effect many organize their lives around them. While
they are still in high school, they may get a part-time job at a grocery store
and use most of what they make to buy the car, insure it, fix it up, buy
gasoline and accessories for it. To a certain extent, this is probably
interesting and satisfying to them at the time, but they have little to show
for it later. At the local junkyard a few years later, they will see that car
rusted out, the hood sticking up, the wheels gone, the windows broken out, the
seats rotting away—the very same car someone spent so much time, energy, and
money on.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Inevitably whatever
receives our time and energy ends up like a car in the junkyard, because
material things disintegrate over time. At best our concerted efforts only slow
down that process a little. From simply a financial standpoint it is not wise
to borrow in order to buy depreciating assets. Experiences like these create
the unconscious feeling that life itself keeps crumbling in our hands even
though we put so much into it. Laying up treasure in heaven means putting our
heart into things that are not subject to deterioration and decay.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Agriculture is a major
industry. As years go by, farming operations get bigger because it takes the
produce of more land to support the people that farm it. Consequently, many
houses built a couple of generations ago stand vacant throughout the
countryside. These unoccupied homes have hay bales in them or have the first
floor is removed so they can be used as hog sheds. They often have ornate trim
work around the porches and eaves. Somebody went to a lot of work cutting out
that trim work, building that chimney, laying up those stone walls. Now the
structures are rotting down despite all that effort.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  These buildings
illustrate what Jesus says about material things in general. When we put our
whole selves into deteriorating things, we feel empty because no lasting
fulfillment comes from our work. The house we painted a few years ago is
starting to peal and chip again. The car we bought six years ago has a rust
spot developing over the back right wheel. The new washing machine we bought
eight years ago quit working yesterday. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
color:windowtext'>O</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>ur own bodies decay;
we cannot </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>even</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> avoid the problem by concentrating on ourselves much
less cars and houses. A recent photograph laid beside one from twenty years ago
tells the story. We are part of a system that degrades over time (entropy). Consequently,
the only escape is to rise above that realm by putting our interests in things
that do not get old. Putting our energies into what lasts brings a sense of
accomplishment and worth. Not everything has to last, but amid so much flux we
need something that does not change so we can have some continuity and
permanence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Do everything as to
the Lord</u>. Verses 22-24 use some interesting imagery for harmony and
wholeness: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The lamp of the body is the eye. If, then, your eye is
single your whole body will be full of light, but if your eye is evil, your
whole body will be full of darkness. If the light that is in you is darkness,
how great is that darkness! No man can serve two masters because he will either
hate one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other. You
cannot serve God and riches.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is rather straightforward to say, “The
light of the body is the eye”; but curiously Jesus adds, <i>“If the light that
is in you is darkness it is very dark indeed.”</i> Perhaps the sense is this: when
our eyes work right, we see one image. But if our eyes are “evil,” we see
double. A cross-eyed or walleyed person sees two images. The same effect can be
achieved by pressing against the side of one eye; two images result because the
eyes are not in focus with each other. There are two basketball goals, two
diverging lanes on the road ahead, two needles to thread. This experience
pictures what it is like to be drawn in two directions at once. On one hand, we
want tangible things; on the other hand, we want intangible things like
interpersonal association with God and other people. We want to enjoy
ourselves; yet we need stability and centeredness at the same time. We feel
pulled apart by two different frames of reference; we have two “masters.”
Having two “masters” would make two ultimate authorities in a slave’s life,
which would be an impossible circumstance. Jesus uses this impossible picture
to teach us that it is impossible to live with two ultimate frames of reference
in life—God and mammon, as he calls them (<b>6</b>:24).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Instead of living in
purely materialistic fashion or trying to hold onto the diverging worlds of
materialism and spirituality, Jesus subordinates the material realm under the
spiritual one. That organizes life under one frame of reference without denying
the material world we live in. A non-religious person does not obtain lasting
fulfillment. The half religious person is even more uncomfortable than the
straight-out materialist, because he is pulled apart by opposing drives. The
only realistic alternative is to be fully religious. When we prioritize
transcendent things—the kingdom of “heaven,” everything else gets taken care of.
Putting spiritual things first lets everything else fall in place. If the two
frames of reference are ever in conflict, the higher one takes precedence. By
nature, persons must have a sense of wholeness. When God is really the Lord of
a person’s life, things not distinctively spiritual combine with the spiritual
orientation to eliminate fragmentation and create wholeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Relieving
fragmentation in turn relieves frustration and meaninglessness. Wholeness
structures life and provides principles for deciding what we do. Life revolves
around one center and God is that center. Wealth is not on one side pulling us
one way and spiritual ideals on the other side pulling us another way. When we
do everything as to the Lord, we unite all aspects of life. We do not feel as
if we have lost our identity because we are fragmented by opposing demands. Our
various aspirations line up in the same direction. We do not want to do this
and that and the other thing. Rather, God stands as the “principle” of
selectivity. Instead of being separate and divided, the aspects of life unite
and reinforce each other. The Head of the spiritual dimension puts in
perspective our use of material things and makes one big picture and one
ultimate goal. There is nothing wrong with material things. The problem lies in
making them everything or making them ultimate. But if we put material things
under the control of the creator, we can use them to accomplish spiritual ends,
which gives us triumph and worth.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Trust God to supply
needs</u> (<b>6</b>:25-32). Jesus tells us not to worry about food or drink or
clothes. He uses birds and grass as illustrations. They do not worry about such
things.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Don’t you think you are more valuable than they are? Even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like the flowers in the field or the
grass in the field. Why do you need to worry about what you are going to wear
or look like? These are the kinds of the things all the Gentiles seek after.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>For strength in life, we trust God for
needs. The point is “needs.” Not all wants are necessities; many of them are
desirables. They are fun; they are nice, but we do not “need” them. Christ
guarantees that our Father has set up creation in a way that provides for what
we need.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Birds and grass are
specific images for a general idea. God’s design correlates an answer with
every need. He did not build life forms with a need for food and water and then
not make anything to eat or drink. If he has provided for even the simplest
animal life in that way, he has surely provided for those created in his image.
God is aware of our needs and has made ample provision for satisfying them; if
we reduce our desires to a level that corresponds with his provisions, we avoid
the frustration that comes from overexpectation.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The difficulty is not
so much need but want. Someone living in a culture without motor vehicles does
not feel deprived over not having a car. But if everybody he knows expects to
own one, he feels underprivileged without a car. The problem is not the lack of
a car, but his expectancy. The situation presents a problem because of the
difference between expectancy and experience. He feels as if he is living in
deprivation of norm. Much of our frustration lies in our imagination, because
God has provided for the things in reality itself. Once we understand where our
frustration and anxiety are coming from, we can do a better job of dealing with
them. We can reduce wants and live in better conformity with the true
situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Evidently Jesus does
not take into consideration here the fact that many people exist in hard
circumstances and some even starve, go homeless, and lack clothing. Such things
are difficult to fit with what Jesus says unless we consider them as aside from
his point—as exceptions to his words. He states a general truth about how
nature functions. Suffering in these areas almost always traces back to human
sin rather than divine failure. Jesus’ approach, however, does have application
even to hard circumstances. God does not necessarily deliver us from suffering
any more than he delivered his own Son. In the midst of such difficulties, if
we maintain spiritual priorities, they will see us through and may even help us
develop virtues that would otherwise be less likely to grow. Such situations
also give righteous people opportunities to express their righteousness to
those less fortunate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Rank things</u> (<b>6</b>:33).
So far we have talked about increasing strength by putting efforts into <u>eternal</u>
things, doing everything as to <u>God</u>, and trusting him for <u>needs</u>. The
next step calls for <u>ranking things</u> by importance with spiritual things
put first. If righteousness and the kingdom of heaven take precedence, we can
be confident that everything else will come out all right. Jesus states his
point in relatively specific terms (material vs. spiritual), but the idea
belongs to the larger principle of ranking things.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Some people are busier
than others, but most people feel too busy. We just do not have enough <u>time</u>
to do everything we need to do and have promised to do, much less everything we
would like to do. If we do not watch out, we get more stacked on us than we can
carry. The same problem applies to <u>money</u>. We want more than we can buy. From
the long list of options we must select what we will do for sure and put the
rest in secondary position. What we make sure to do should be the important
items on the list; otherwise, we feel just as pressured from non-essentials as
we do from essentials. We take up so much time with good things that we have
little left for best things. By ranking them, we make sure to handle the
decisive issues. Lesser things fill in around the edges. We pick them up as
time permits without feeling like we have failed if we can’t. Not ranking
things makes everything equally important, which is frustrating and
unfulfilling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Reduce life to
manageable units</u> (<b>6</b>:34). The final verse of the chapter says, <i>“Don’t
worry about tomorrow; it will worry about itself. There is enough evil in one
day.” </i>This verse hints at another principle for reducing frustration and
dissatisfaction. A common saying warns against <i>“biting off more than you can
chew.”</i> So to speak, Jesus advises “biting life off in chewable chunks” by
living a day at a time instead of letting life go on and on and on or trying to
face everything all at once. Instead, we can line things up in sequence of
time—in something of the same fashion as lining things up in sequence of <u>importance</u>.
This approach offers a way to manage responsibilities. The future is broken
down into segments we handle a piece at a time. We are not continually looking
past what we are doing and worrying about the next one. When that much is
finished, <u>then</u> we move to next piece, and so on. We do not try to handle
everything at once, but break things down into pieces and put them in sequence.
That sequence is then organized into manageable segments rather than conceived
of as one endless stream.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  History does form a
line in that it keeps moving forward to new possibilities rather than simply
circulating back and forth among the same old options. But within that linear
process recurring cycles mark life off in subunits we can handle. Not only are
there hours and days, but weeks, months, years, and generations. This
segmenting of life is analogous to the account of God’s creative work. Moses
presents the history of creation as a day-by-day, forward-moving, building
process, which corresponds with life as an ongoing series of weeks. The Old
Testament Jewish festival cycle marked off time by Sabbaths, new moons, annuals
feasts, Sabbatical years, and years of Jubilee (note Exodus <b>20</b>:8-11,<i>
etc</i>.). Perhaps one reason God built cycles into life is that he also built
us in a way that we need them. The fact that we cannot see all eternity now
corresponds with the fact that we cannot cope with the whole future at once. Unlike
God we do not face everything all at once, nor do we have to face one thing
right after another in endless succession. There are new beginnings in the
recurrences of each widening cycle, and we have to face only as much as can
come to us in one day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Some of us need
physical exercise to help keep weight down. I have been in the jogging routine
for several years and know from that experience what trying hard is like. Most
of the time, I jog through the countryside. When I get out away from the house
and get tired, I sometimes have to think of the task as running from one light
pole to the next. As I get to that pole I look ahead to the next one. Sometimes
I get it down to running from fence post to fence post! That way I am
accomplishing a big thing a little bit at a time. I do not try to run as far as
I can see—to the little house on the horizon. I run to the next point and from
there run to the next. Pretty soon I am passing that house on the horizon. When
we break life down into manageable chunks, we do not have to be able to run
from here to the horizon. We run only from here to the next place and from
there to the next until we get to the horizon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There are endless
applications of this principle. An old story tells about a man who willed his
estate to the one of his three offspring that could break a bundle of sticks. The
first two that tried it could not break the bundle, but the third one untied
the bundle and broke the sticks one at a time. It is the same thing in life
generally. The “bundle” can be broken either way. If we break them all at once,
we do get them broken; but most of us cannot deal with that much at once. Biting
life off in manageable chunks is much easier.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  At our house we
sometimes raise green beans in our garden because they yield well. The trouble
is that they come due in the hot part of the year. Picking a thirty-foot row of
green beans is sometimes more than I am eager to tackle in the heat. I have
learned to make the job easier by kneeling down at the beginning of the row,
shoving the bucket out about arm’s length, picking to the bucket, and shoving
it another arm’s length. Pretty soon when I push the bucket out there, it bumps
into the fence on the other end of the row. I do not pick a thirty-foot row of
green beans; I pick ten three-foot rows. We can handle life in smaller chunks
like these; but tackling one big long piece is sometimes too much.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There is an important
connection between <b>6</b>:19-34 and the illustration about two builders that
built houses respectively on rock and on sand. Building life on these
principles gives us side benefits for coping with life. We often think of
psychology as a secular discipline, but the scripture addresses more than
present moral issues and salvation from future hell. In fact, to a great extent
what we call “spiritual matters” are really interpersonal matters. The work of
Christ both in his teaching and in his atonement aims at renewing relationship
with God. The essence of salvation is reconciliation between alienated persons.
Since reconciliation deals with persons, it deals with factors that affect the
psychological strength of persons that make up that relationship with God and
each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The Bible addresses
the whole person. When Jesus says to build life on him and his teachings, he is
saying more than meets the ear. That has not only to do with spiritual
teaching, but with powerful living. To a great extent that “power” is
psychological strength, the ability to cope.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In <b>6</b>:19-21 we
find five principles for power: (1) spend time and effort on <u>eternal</u>
things; (2) do everything as to the <u>Lord</u>; (4) trust God for <u>needs</u>;
(5) <u>rank</u> things by importance; and, (6) reduce life to manageable units.
In combination these practices decrease frustration and provide security and
satisfaction; they reduce fragmentation, tension, disconnectedness, and
division; and offer wholeness and meaningfulness in their place.</span></p>
