<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                The
previous study on Matthew <b>7</b>:12 dealt with the <u>meaning</u> of the
Golden Rule. This study looks at the <u>impact</u> of the Golden Rule on
individuals and on their relationships. In the parallel between <i>“[Do] [to
others] [as you would have others do to you]”</i> and <i>“[Love] [your
neighbor] [as yourself],” </i>we made two primary observations. (1) <i>Do</i>
replaces <i>love</i>; so love is an action that can be commanded. That doing is
a giving of ourselves for the joy of others. Often <i>love</i> means giving of
ourselves for the needs of others, but we can also love God, who <i>“is not
served by men’s hands as though he needed anything”</i> (Acts <b>17</b>:25). It
is better, then, to define love broadly enough to include loving him. When we
meet people’s needs, we are increasing their happiness; so love becomes
self-giving for the joy of others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Comparing
the Golden Rule and the Second Great Commandment shows that (2) <i>neighbor</i>
means <i>others</i> without restriction. The Golden Rule principle applies to
all relationships, not only to Christians and friends, but to people outside
the faith, people we do not know, and people who work against us—our “enemies.”
Looking for the values of the Golden Rule means looking for the ways it makes
life meaningful for us and joyful for everyone. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                For
the individual, the first value of practicing the Golden Rule is that it <u>enhances
ability to relate effectively to other people</u>. In this respect there is
healing value in treating people the way we want to be treated. “Healing” in
this case means improving conditions to more nearly what they ought to be. That
healing value affects the individual who does the Golden Rule because doing it
requires “projecting consciousness” over behind the eyes of someone else. We
all see the world from behind our own eyes, but we can transfer our perspective
over behind the eyes of someone else. We use imagination to see what things
look like from over there. Treating others the way we want to be treated
requires “being in their shoes” or “putting ourselves in their place.” Otherwise,
we do not take into consideration the difference between their situation and
ours. Fulfilling the Golden Rule involves taking into consideration the
differences between us and them and between our situation and theirs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Learning
to project consciousness is the first step in the socialization process. Human
beings are social beings, not just unrelated individuals. We have the capacity
not just to deal with our own environment, but to relate to others who can in
turn relate to us. To do that, both of us must think about what it is like to
be in each other’s place. Society can exist only to the extent that each person
looks at the situation from other than his own viewpoint alone. If we do not
consider other people’s needs, we are treating them like things and acting
self-centeredly. We are forcing them to fit our agendas, which is
individualism. By projecting our consciousness over behind the eyes of others,
we enter the socialization process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                As we
grow up, we develop the ability to see the other person’s point of view. Young
kids cannot do this as well as teenagers and adults. My wife and I have four
children. One time somebody asked one of them, “How old are you?” He held up
three fingers inside of a mitten. In another episode one evening my wife put
the kids to bed, turned the lights off, and went in the other room. Then she
thought of something she needed to ask one of them; so she went back in and
asked him. There was no answer. She asked him again. Silence. As she asked a
third time, she happened to reach down and touch his head. He was nodding his
head in the dark. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                In
about the same way, we adults do not always stop to think that the other person
cannot, so to speak, see inside our mittens. A socialized person would take off
the mitten. We have all probably seen someone talking in a phone booth pointing
around as if he were describing his surroundings or giving directions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Sometimes
we catch ourselves doing about the same thing. Late one Sunday night after
preaching at an evening service two hours away, I was driving home with the
family through hilly countryside on a narrow two-lane road with lots of curves.
I was getting exasperated with people not dimming their lights. It was hard to
see with bright lights shining in my eyes. Pretty soon the car ahead of me
started slowing down and kept slowing down till we were only going twenty miles
an hour. A little way up the road we came to a group of houses where there was
room enough for him to pull off. I thought, <i>“Well, great. Now I can get on
home.” </i>After I passed him, I looked in the rear-view mirror and watched as
he pulled back on the road and came up close behind me. He turned his lights on
bright and let them glare off my rear-view and side-view mirrors. While I was
holding my head down to keep the glare out of my eyes, I noticed the little red
light on my dash. I had had my own bright lights on all that time! I suppose we
have all done things like that. Usually they are unintentional, but these
lapses show that we do not always think about what is necessary to take into
consideration in social settings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                We
have been talking about getting to the place where we can put ourselves in the
other person’s position. Developing this skill is one reason play is so
important for young children. When kids play, they are doing the very thing we
are talking about. They are projecting themselves into imaginary situations. They
are playing mothers or doctors or policemen—roles they do not really have. Play
uses this projection mechanism, and it is important for kids to use it. Adults
might be tempted to think that little kids should work more, but playing is
important for shaping their personalities. It enables them to become social
beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Developing
the ability to look at things from other people’s viewpoints is a “side effect”
of practicing the Golden Rule. We become more perceptive of human nature in
general as well as in the particular people we are relating to. It is terribly
important to understand people as well as possible so we limit mistakes in
choosing what to say and how to act toward them. This is a “healing value” of
the Golden Rule because it changes us from less effective interaction by
requiring us to project consciousness. Treating other people the way we would
want to be treated in their shoes not only keeps us from ruining personalities
that are already good; it can turn around patterns of relating that are less
effective. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                For
the individual, the second value of practicing the Golden Rule is that it <u>establishes
the habit of taking initiative</u>. To be treating people the way we want to be
treated, we do not wait for them to make the first move. We naturally make the
first move when the situation calls for it. Doing the Golden Rule creates a
different kind of a personality in us. Without realizing it, we can get into
the habit of letting someone else take the initiative. I have had friends who
expected their wives to make the phone calls about fixing the car or making
appointments regarding things that were their own responsibilities. Taking
initiative in turn fosters a positive attitude toward life, because we find out
that other people do not usually reject us, which increases self-confidence. We
do not want to be followers who let other people take the brunt of the action
up front. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                This
is one reason the Golden Rule is a positive statement in scripture. Outside the
Bible we find the Golden Rule stated in negative form: “Do not treat other
people in ways you would not want to be treated.” A lot of good comes from this
principle even in negative form, because it reduces the number of evil things people
would otherwise do to each other. But the negative principle does not keep us
from being passive. It does not prod us into taking initiative in doing good
things for other people. Jesus states his life principle in positive terms. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                For
the individual the third value of practicing the Golden Rule is that it <u>eliminates
the distrust complex</u>. If we are taking the initiative, we have to override
the tendency to distrust. We have probably had experiences where we tried to do
someone a good turn, and instead of appreciating it he took advantage of us. A
few such experiences and we get afraid that other people in general respond
this way. We have to stand up for our rights, or people will run over us. Frankly,
with some people there is some truth in that, but practicing the Golden Rule
sets that aside as a reason to distrust them. It urges us to trust them first,
to take the initiative and relate to them as we ought to, regardless of whether
they have acted that way toward us first or regardless of whether they respond
to our goodness the way they should.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Besides
healing values for the individual, the Golden Rule has interpersonal healing
values. Following the Golden Rule strengthens personalities by encouraging us
to take initiative, to think positively, and to progress through the
socialization process. The most basic mechanism in all of this is the
projecting of consciousness to the other person’s vantage point. It raises the
quality of the individual person. Interpersonal healing values raise the
quality of relationships. The first set of benefits lies within the individual.
A second set of benefits lies in relationships between individuals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                The
first interpersonal value of practicing the Golden Rule is that it <u>negates
the law of retaliation</u>. It sets aside the principle of hitting back,
getting revenge, getting back at people. This point about the Golden Rule is
extremely important. Sometimes we would be perfectly happy if we could just
figure out how to keep situations from going bad in the first place or at least
getting any worse. Many of us would be happy if we could just keep from making
the mistakes that turn people off and drive them away. But obeying the Golden
Rule accomplishes even more than that. If we just keep situations from getting
worse, then bad situations do not get corrected. The Golden Rule can do more
than keep a bad situation from escalating; it can take a bad situation and turn
it around. The accompanying diagram pictures the idea. The spiral represents
the give-and-take between people. We can go on indefinitely, not doing anything
particularly good or particularly bad—just maintaining the relationship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                In
many situations, however, rather than being neutral, an act on one side is
noticeably positive or negative, and the quality of the relationship starts
moving up or down accordingly. People typically respond in kind. We treat
others the way they have treated us. If we do something other people dislike, they
tend to react toward us the same way. They react negatively if we act
negatively. Soon we are in a “downward spiral of deteriorating relationships”—a
“vicious cycle.” One person’s poor attitude feeds the other person’s poor
attitude, which makes the first attitude worse, and so on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                The
Golden Rule turns this element of human nature into a mechanism for good. If we
do good to someone, they tend at least to respond less negatively, possibly in
the neutral way, sometimes in a positive manner. Consequently, we can stop the
downward spiral of deteriorating relationships by taking the initiative, which
calls for returning good for evil at some point along the way. That slows up
the deterioration, stops the downward spiral, or turns it around. In other
words, what keeps relationships healthy and causes them to grow is the very
thing that turns deteriorating relationships around and heads them in the
opposite direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                As
Jesus says earlier in this sermon, “Blessed are the peacemakers.” The Golden
Rule provides the means for making peace. In an inspiring devotional passage,
Paul says, “Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Hold onto what
is good. In love for the brothers, be tenderly affectionate toward one another
in honor, preferring one another” (Romans<b> 12</b>:9). Verse 14 continues, <i>“Bless
them that persecute you. Bless and do not curse.”</i> That sounds familiar. The
chapter closes with another classic statement: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Do not be not wise in your own conceits. Do not render
to any man evil for evil. Take thought of things honorable in the sight of all
men. If it is possible as much as lies in you, be at peace with all men. Do not
avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath for it is written, “Vengeance
belongs to me. I will repay,” says the Lord.” If your enemy is hungry, feed
him. If he is thirsty, give him to something to drink. In so doing, you will
heap coals of fire on his head. Do not be not overcome with evil but overcome
evil with good </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<b>12</b>:16b-21).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If a bad relationship
is ever going to be changed, one side or the other has to do good back to the
one who did evil. That requires more than doing good in a neutral situation; it
calls for doing good in a negative one. We overcome evil with good by
practicing the Golden Rule. It reverses the spiral by responding to evil with
good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                A
second interpersonal value of practicing the Golden Rule is that it <u>eliminates
the competition mentality</u>. We often base our sense of worth on being better
than other people—at succeeding in competition against them. We have to feel
above them to feel secure and significant. But success in competition is not a
very good basis for feeling good about ourselves. It cannot work for very many
people, and even for them it works only in certain areas and only for a while—till
someone even better comes along or till they weaken with age. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Living
the Golden Rule builds self-esteem by self-giving for the joy of others. We
feel good about making people happy. They make us feel good by appreciating us
for what we have done. We do not compete with them; that pits us against them. We
do for them; that unites us with love. The Golden Rule puts us in true
horizontal relationship to people so we do not have to put them down to raise
ourselves up. We do not have to make them feel bad to make ourselves feel good.
That brings something good to both of us. We both “win.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                This
highly respected principle deserves the attention we have given it. It is the
basic social mechanism by which all people everywhere relate to each other in
positive ways. It is Jesus’ primary principle for social existence: <i>“Do to
others as you would have others do to you.”</i> It restates the ancient
principle God revealed through Moses when he organized the Israelite nation: <i>“Love
your neighbor as yourself.”</i> Jesus defines love as <i>“doing”</i> and
neighbor as <i>“others.”</i> He explains <i>“as yourself” </i>by saying <i>“as
you would have them do to you.”</i> We relate to all people by this principle. It
socializes us, gives us initiative, and removes distrust. It gets rid of
revenge and eliminates competition as a mechanism for achieving self-worth.</span></p>
