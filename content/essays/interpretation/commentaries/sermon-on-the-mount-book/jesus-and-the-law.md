<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Our study of the
Sermon on the Mount brings us to Matthew <b>5</b>:17-20, the second “petal” on
the daisy. We have entitled it “Jesus and the Law” because it shows how his
ministry and teaching relate to God’s earlier revelation. This paragraph
introduces Jesus’ objection to the Pharisees. He contrasts his teaching more
with theirs than with the Old Testament Law itself. The verses deal with his
concern that people not misunderstand what he is teaching. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Do
not think that I came to destroy the law of the prophets. I did not come to
destroy them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, till heaven and earth
passes away not one jot or tittle will pass away from the law until everything
is accomplished. Whoever then breaks one of these least commandments and
teaches men so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does
them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Because I tell
you that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and
Pharisees you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The first question is
why Jesus says, <i>“Do not suppose that I came to destroy the law or the
prophets.”</i> In the next paragraphs, he contrasts his ideas with those the
Jews had heard connected with Old Testament passages. He does not want them to
think he is contradicting the Law instead of correcting popular
misunderstandings of it. In fact, he came to accomplish its purpose: <i>“I did
not come to destroy it but to fulfill it.”</i> Jesus claims to be within the
framework of previous revelation through Moses and the prophets. More than that,
he claims to fulfill its anticipations. He fulfilled it first by correcting
typical misconceptions about its meaning, secondly by calling attention to
underlying principles of the law as distinguished from some specifics in it,
and thirdly by fulfilling its predictions. In this context he is mainly
concerned to explain fundamental, permanent truths in contrast to temporary
civil aspects occasioned by the national dimension of the Mosaic covenant and
in contrast to ceremonial provisions that anticipated Messiah’s real redemptive
work. In general, he wants to avoid misunderstandings about his ministry. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  He did not come to “destroy”
the law or the prophets. <i>Destroy</i> means different things to different
people, depending on how they understand the relationship between the Law of
Moses and the ministry of Jesus. The accompanying chart summarizes the ways
Christians have related the New Covenant to the Mosaic Law. In light of texts
like Hebrews <b>8-10</b>, we know there is a contrast of identity and kind between
the Mosaic and Messianic covenants even though Matthew <b>5</b>:17 teaches that
Messiah came in continuity with Moses and the prophets. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:4.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  “Destroy” suggests
doing something negative with the Law—throwing it away as if it were false, as
if it were not from God, as if it should not have been governing Israel. There
have been those in the Christian era who wanted to “destroy” the law in this
sense. In the early centuries, Marcion represented this attitude. He saw such a
difference between the God of the Old Covenant and the God of the new that both
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>covenants could not both
be from him—could not both be good and true. Consequently, what had b</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>een done in God’s name before was to be repudiated,
and the revelation through Christ put in its place. This is the very attitude
Jesus denies: <i>“I did not come to repudiate the law as if it were not genuine
revelation from the one true God.”</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Another approach adds
the gospel to the law. The Judaizing teachers that Paul confronted in the Book
of Acts and elsewhere represented one form of this idea. During his missionary
endeavors, these Jewish believers were following him around the Gentile
territories, “correcting” his teaching and adding to what he said. According to
them, to be saved, Gentiles who became Christians also had to be circumcised
and become Jews, thereby putting themselves under the Mosaic Law. This idea had
a combined effect called “Galatianism” because particularly in the Book of Galatians
Paul addresses this heresy. The notion seemed to be that we are saved by
Christ; and after being reconciled to God, we continue in that relationship by
obeying the Law. Paul objected because in effect such a scheme would bring back
the same problem we had before—that none of us can succeed at living up to the
perfection the Law required. In principle, circumcision would bring us back
under the very thing that was the source of death to us in the first place,
because death is the consequence of sin. The gospel is not something simply
added to the Law so we end up keeping them both or basing continued salvation
on continued observance of everything God commanded in the Old Testament. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A more frequent
approach today amends the Law in terms of the gospel. Constitutions usually
have a provision that allows for changing items within the constitution itself.
Under this conception Christians are under the Mosaic law as amended by
Messianic revelation. Things that God no longer intends for us to keep have
been removed by amendment. For instance, we no longer need to keep dietary laws,
because Mark <b>7</b>:19 says Jesus <i>“cleansed all meats.”</i> The same can
be done with the observance of Sabbath days and new moons because of Paul’s
comments in Galatians <b>4</b>:8-11 and Colossians <b>2</b>:16-17. Paul’s
comments on circumcision removes it as the identifying mark for the people of
God now. Since Christ fulfilled the sacrificial system, we do not offer
sacrifices. The priesthood and accompanying features have been removed by the
change of priesthoods implicitly predicted by Psalm <b>110</b>:4: <i>“The Lord
swore and will not repent himself. You are a priest forever after the order of <u>Melchizedek</u>
[not Aaron].”</i> That verse is the backbone for the middle section in Hebrews
as it contrasts the first and second covenants. In this way of thinking, we do
not follow Mosaic civil legislation, because the people of God are no longer
organized into a national system. We do not observe dietary laws, the festival
cycle, circumcision, sacrificial codes, and other regulations because they have
been amended out of the law one by one. Failure to do them now does not break
God’s Law. This approach requires going through the lists of Old Testament
ordinances and removing each one that the New Testament annuls. We are really
under the Mosaic Law minus all commandments specifically withdrawn—civil and
ceremonial regulations, generally speaking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There are difficulties
with this approach although it has fewer problems than the previous two. The
Mosaic Law came from God, but the gospel does not simply add to it or amend it.
Those saved by Christ do not then maintain salvation by living perfectly. As
Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:26 says, we would have to continue to do all the things
that are required of the law or we would be under a curse (cp. Galatians <b>3</b>:10).
Not only are we under a different covenant, we are also under a different <u>kind</u>
of system from what Mosaism was (Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34). It is based on
personal relationship factors rather than on legal processes. Another
difficulty is that we would have to obey every Mosaic commandment not
specifically removed by direct statement or indirect implication. It is hard to
remove every specific requirement that does not seem applicable to Christians. The
New Testament does not clearly make statements that take care of them all one
at a time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The New Testament does
not specifically cancel “the law of jealously,” for example, a procedure for
testing whether a wife has been unfaithful (Numbers <b>5</b>:11-31). Perhaps we
could argue that this item falls under “civil regulations,” which as a class
are removed because there is no national aspect to the kingdom now. That there
is no national aspect to the kingdom now, however, has, in fact, been denied
implicitly by every attempt to establish a theocracy during the Christian
dispensation. Some experiments in colonial America serve as examples. Besides,
it does not have to be regarded as a civil regulation. At any rate, nothing in
the New Testament specifically annuls the law of jealousy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Some early Christians
tried another approach, one that spiritualized the Old Testament in terms of
the gospel. Going through the Old Testament, they took its episodes and
teachings and plugged Christian meaning into them. Even in historical sections
like Genesis, they would find references to the Christian gospel. They made
literal, historical material say something spiritual that was in the gospel. That
way they could still regard the law as true without observing the particulars
it contained. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The proper approach,
we believe, abrogates the law. “Abrogate” means to take out of jurisdiction, to
annul, to cancel, to repeal. The law as a code is not now the relevant
expression of God’s will for human life. It did express his will for Jews, but
the New Testament is the new “code” that expresses his will for Christians. There
is a code-context distinction here. Changing the code does not change all the
contents to other things. Abrogating the law means taking it away only as far
as <u>commandments</u> are concerned. The issue here is what we should <u>do</u>,
not what we should <u>believe</u>. It is not a question about the <u>truth</u>
of the Old Testament, but about its <u>role</u>. The law is not “destroyed,”
but annulled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The broad arrow given
earlier represents the flow of holy history. The left part pictures God’s will
for his people during the Mosaic age. At that time, <u>Israel</u> was the
people of God in a national sense. The right part of the arrow stands for God’s
will during the Christian age, “spiritual Israel” in an interpersonal sense. At
this time, the <u>church</u> is the people of God. In the shift from the
previous “dispensation” to the present, many things do not change, some things
drop out altogether, a few things are adjusted, and some things are added. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A constitution
specifies what its subjects should <u>do</u>. Canceling it does not affect
items that are <u>not done</u>. The contrast between the Law of Moses and the
New Testament, then, does not bring into question Old Testament descriptive
teaching about historical, natural, and geographical matters. <u>Historical</u>
matters include the origin of the universe, what has happened since creation
like the origin of Israel and prophecies about the future. Descriptive
statements about the nature of things—<u>ontological</u> matters—include all
teaching about the nature of God, the nature of history, the nature of humankind,
the purposes of God, and so on. <u>Geographical</u> location of events does not
change; consequently, the record of them does not change. History, nature, and
geography are not things to do, but things to understand. The Old Testament
provides accurate information on all these categories—of all things whereof it
speaks; so these elements “continue.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Civil</u>
regulations comprise one category that drops out. Civil regulations directed
national and political affairs in Israel. Besides their religious duties, the
priests had administrative powers. They were the health officers of the nation,
for instance. The Levites were the financial officers of Israel. There were
laws that governed property rights. The New Testament says some things about
how Christians should organize themselves; so there are functional equivalents of
national structure. But the church does not have the political aspect included
in Old Testament civil legislation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the Torah there
were also <u>ceremonial</u> regulations. These include the sacrificial system
and other tabernacle/temple observances. Some ceremonial observances appear in
the New Testament as well, although significantly fewer. The Lord’s Supper and
baptism are the examples we observe. Christians observe these ordinances, not
the Old Testament ones. The code we are under is a different code from the Old
Testament. Not being under the former covenant does not deny the former code’s
truthfulness or divine origin; it simply means that it no longer regulates
human behavior in regard to matters not of permanent import. God has moved into
a new stage of his overall plan for history. We operate now according to the
values and ceremonies God instituted for this era, which the old covenant
prepared for and looked forward to as shadows of later realities (Hebrews <b>8</b>:5;
<b>10</b>:1). Civil and ceremonial regulations have dropped out altogether, and
a few new ceremonial observances have been added in. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Generally speaking, <u>moral</u>
matters continue, or perhaps we can say are “reinstituted.” The Mosaic moral
structure is the same with a few alterations that stem from progressive
revelation. One example of adjustment is the provision for divorce for any
cause (Deuteronomy <b>24</b>:1-4). Anything unacceptable in the spouse was
grounds for divorce, and only men could initiate divorce. Legally, divorce had
no moral stigma attached to it. Jesus alters the divorce issue into one that
does have moral connections. If divorce occurs now, sin is involved somewhere
in the situation. This complex issue occupies our attention in chapters 4 and 5
dealing with<b> 5</b>:31-32. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In a sense, the shift
on divorce was not a change in moral principles. In Matthew <b>19</b>:3-12
Jesus shows that from the beginning divorce was contrary to God’s intentions. The
legislation in Deuteronomy was <u>civil</u> regulation. Genesis <b>1-2</b>
implies God’s <u>moral</u> intent. As part of God’s progressive revelation,
Moses allowed a less exact requirement because contemporary Israelites were not
ready for the full expectancy. There are not many moral considerations that
have changed in the shift from first to second covenant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  This last approach to
law-gospel relationship works from zero up. Such a format means that only New
Testament directives apply to Christian practice. We do not have to find a way
to eliminate each item of Mosaic legislation that does not relate to us. Annulment
is not item-by-item, but covenant wide. There does not have to be a specific
annulment for each withdrawn observance or class of observances. Neither do we
have to prove that a commandment belongs to some withdrawn class of observances
before we can disregard it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  That is an important
gain because it reduces the likelihood of mistakes. Even if we agree, for
example, that civil and ceremonial commandments have been annulled, we still
must decide whether a given provision belongs in one of these categories—as the
Mosaic civil divorce law illustrates. That sets us up to make mistakes. Another
difficulty is that some commandments combine temporary and permanent features. Civil
or ceremonial matters may have moral facets, which we might agree do continue. Are
Christians supposed to keep Sabbath, for example? Was Sabbath-keeping a moral
commandment, simply a civil/national observance, or a combination of the two? Did
it have a moral aspect, as its presence among the ten commandments might
suggest? If so, what was that moral aspect? Was eating blood forbidden because
it was immoral, because it was physically or psychologically unhealthy, or
because cultural associations made it unwise at the time? A third difficulty is
that even though we may agree that moral commandments tend to carry over,
certain exceptions are conceivable. These problems only complicate
interpretation and therefore increase the likelihood of theological errors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  When Jesus said, <i>“I
did not come to destroy the law,”</i> he was not repudiating it as false or
denying that Jews should have been keeping it. He came in the tradition of that
very Law to fulfill what it anticipated. In fact, not one jot or tittle of it
would pass away without accomplishing its purpose.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Verse 20 is a splice
between Jesus’ relationship to the law (<b>5</b>:17-19) and objections he
raises against the way Pharisees were misusing the Law (<b>5</b>:21-6:18). Jesus
proceeds to talk about exceeding the righteousness of the Pharisees, not so
much by doing more than they did, but by following a more mature kind of
righteousness. For that reason, he does not contrast his teaching with the Law
itself, but with the misuse of it that undergirded Pharisaical righteousness in
places like the ones he cites. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  By scanning this
material, we infer his point by observing how Jesus quotes the Old Testament
and then comments on it. <i>“Do not commit murder”</i> he heightens to <i>“Do
not get angry.” “Do not commit adultery”</i> becomes <i>“Do not lust.” “Give a
certificate of divorcement if you divorce”</i> is adjusted to <i>“Do not
divorce.”</i> The Pharisees say, <i>“Do not swear falsely”</i>; but Jesus says,
<i>“Do not swear at all.”</i> A quotation found several times in the Pentateuch
(the first five books of the Old Testament), <i>“An eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth,”</i> Jesus rephrases to mean, <i>“Do not react to evil,”</i> or <i>“Do
not have a retaliating mentality.” </i>(The saying was not originally intended
anyway as a principle for social relations, but as a principle for measuring
out punishment for crimes; that is, the punishment should be commensurate with
the crime.) The second great commandment, <i>“love your neighbor,”</i> plus <i>“and
hate your enemy”</i> (not found in the Old Testament), Jesus increases to <i>“love
your enemy.” </i>In chapter 6 we see the religious leaders—whom he elsewhere
calls <i>hypocrites</i>—involved in displayed giving. Jesus says, <i>“Give in
secret.”</i> In place of “pompous praying” Jesus calls for “praying privately.”
They practiced conspicuous fasting; he says, “Fast in secret.” The question is,
“How do these two sets differ in the way they look at God’s will for life?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In subsequent chapters
we work out these contrasts more closely. The main point for now is that Jesus
did not destroy what God had commanded before. He did not set it aside as
irrelevant or false. On the contrary, he came in the train of that history—including
the Mosaic Law—to fulfill it by bringing about its predictions and by bringing
to full conclusion what it had begun: the restoration of righteousness among people
and the restoration of relationship between them and God on the basis of that
righteousness. Jesus embodies the intent of what God set up through Moses and
the prophets, who prepared the Israelites for the coming of their Messiah. </span></p>
