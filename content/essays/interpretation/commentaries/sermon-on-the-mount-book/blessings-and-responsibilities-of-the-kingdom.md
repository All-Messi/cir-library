<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The first portion of
Matthew <b>5-7</b> has to do with the first “petal on our daisy”: Blessings and
Responsibilities (<b>5</b>:3-16). Before looking at the meaning of the verses individually,
we must see how the structure of the sermon may affect its interpretation. Since
it is wisdom literature, it is loosely structured. The significance of this
point can be appreciated by looking at Luke’s Sermon on the Plain (<b>6</b>:20-49),
which has several close parallels with the Sermon on the Mount. Despite
similarities many interpreters consider them different presentations, partly
because they may fall at different points in Jesus’ ministry. Regardless of
whether they are two accounts of the same sermon or different accounts of two
sermons, Luke’s rearrangement of similar material shows that we should be
cautious about making too much out of connectors between blocks of material. In
other words, context connections in wisdom literature are less helpful in
interpretation, because the writer tends to connect his paragraphs more loosely.
They are self-contained units more than interdependent ones. In yet other
places Luke has bits and pieces that appear in Matthew <b>5-7</b>. Luke <b>13</b>:22-24ff.
compares with Matthew <b>7</b>:21-23 on the judgment scene and the narrow gate.
Luke <b>16</b>:17-18 parallels Matthew<b> 5</b>:18 and 32, which includes the “jot
and tittle” statement and the ethics of marriage. The connections we see
between portions of the sermon may not have been as strong in Jesus’ mind as
they might look to us. The structure of Matthew’s account may be more apparent
than real. Observations based on sequence and association may be well to make,
but their validity probably rests more on the nature of adjacent subjects than
on their placement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  For purposes of
comment, we are combining the beatitudes (5:3-12) and the salt and light
sayings (<b>5</b>:13-16). That pairs together blessings and responsibilities. Being
blessed results from participation with God and his purposes for us. Responsibilities
also belong to our privileged status as his sons. Balancing blessings and responsibilities
removes any self-centeredness that comes from concentrating too much on what we
get to the neglect of what we should give. We have good things to enjoy; we
also have a job to do. There is both favor and mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the beatitudes the
first thing that meets the eye is the repeated word <i>blessed</i>. It occurs
nine times in regard to eight different aspects of the state of the blessed. “Blessed”
people are hungry for righteousness, they are merciful and pure in heart, they
are peacemakers. A person wants these things, and <i>blessedness</i> means
something that covers such things. But it is striking that Jesus does not apply
<i>blessedness</i> simply to the merciful, pure of heart, and peacemakers. He
applies it also to the meek and poor in spirit and even to those who mourn and
suffer persecution. We might not expect <i>blessedness</i> to apply to these
last four matters. Whatever it is, blessedness does not depend on being in good
earthly circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The word <i>blessed</i>,
used in older translations like the King James and American Standard Versions,
does not exactly match the idea found in the original language. Blessing
pictures something that one person does to another. Another Greek word would
probably have expressed that other notion better. The beatitudes do not all
picture one person blessing another, although that is the case with peacemakers
and mourners; and it is true that God blesses us. But one person’s activity
directed at another person is not the main point of the expression, because not
all the beatitudes picture one person doing something to another one to bless
him. Blessedness comes from realizing God’s attitude toward us. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>Happy</i> is a word
used frequently in modern translations, but it too is deficient. Its derivation
suggests that “happiness” depends on what “happens.” Perhaps that is why <i>happy</i>
has a lighter, shallower feel. It is not a very good description for the
beatitude circumstance, because some beatitudes certainly do not envision
shallow circumstances. <i>Happy</i> does not easily associate with persecution
or mourning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Two other expressions
may be better. <i>Fortunate</i> is good because people can be fortunate under
both positive and negative conditions—whether they are persecuted or
peacemakers. <i>Well-off</i> is another expression. A person can be “well-off”
in all eight beatitude situations. Someone mourning or poor in spirit, someone
meek or persecuted, can be “well-off.” The beatitudes call for a positive
attitude despite temporal circumstances. We feel like going on, taking hold,
trying to accomplish something. Life is worthwhile, and we want to get on with
it despite setbacks, frustrations, difficulties, and opposition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  From beyond us comes a
supply for inner dynamic, a sense that life is worthwhile despite detracting
features. Perhaps we can gain a “feel” of things from Acts <b>20</b>:35, the
only recorded statement of Jesus found outside the gospels: <i>“It is more
blessed to give than to receive.”</i> More satisfaction comes from giving
ourselves or our things than comes from receiving more things. This sense of
satisfaction may be even more important than a positive attitude toward life. At
any rate, blessedness involves a positive attitude that accompanies a sense of
satisfaction in life. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We have been talking
about what blessedness is. Now we must learn how to have it. Jesus does not
explain the mechanics by which it comes. He simply observes that people can
have it even while they mourn because they know they will be comforted. Nevertheless,
cues in the beatitudes show how to gain blessedness. It is obtained by
identifying with God. He stands above and in control of the sources of
persecution, mourning, and strife. He is the basis for boldness in the midst of
turmoil. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Identifying with God
relates to the appeal to heaven in the first and last beatitudes: <i>“Blessed
are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. And blessed are you when men reproach you and persecute you.
Rejoice and be glad because they persecuted the prophets ahead of you.”</i> Suffering
persecution for righteousness is an indication of your righteousness; otherwise,
evil people would not be persecuting you. You can be glad over this proof that
you are on God’s side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The use of <i>heaven</i>
here especially is characteristic of Matthew’s gospel. Except for five cases (<b>6</b>:33;
<b>12</b>:28; <b>19</b>:24; <b>21</b>:31, 43), Matthew uses the expression <i>kingdom
of heaven</i> (28 times), even in passages that have parallels in Mark and Luke
that say <i>kingdom of God</i> (6 times). <i>Heaven</i> elsewhere amounts to a
substitute term (metonymy) for God. The prodigal son says, <i>“I have sinned
against heaven”</i> (Luke<b> 15</b>:18, 21). Matthew uses <i>heaven</i> at
least twice as often (85) as the other gospels (Mark = 19, Luke = 42, John 21).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>Heaven</i>
indicates an orientation that transcends earthly life. If daily experiences are
negative and detract from happiness, fun, or entertainment, nothing ultimate is
lost. The one we are tied to is in heaven. He stands above all the instability
we could feel overwhelmed by. Identifying ourselves with him gives us a
transcendent viewpoint—an omniscient perspective. We can look at life from the
vantage point of what is stable and unchanging. Identity with God provides
stability that would not be present if we were limited to the shifting sands of
this world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>Transcendent</i>
means that God is above flux and threat. <i>Heaven</i> gets at the transcendent
nature of his rule and kingdom. One reason for choosing this terminology is
that Matthew wants to define the kingdom prophesied in the Old Testament and
anticipated by the people of Israel. The Jews were pre-conditioned to political
thinking and to their pressing hope for liberation from foreign domination. It
was easy for them to suppose that the Messianic kingdom was political and that
Messiah would bring blessedness by establishing international peace and
righteousness in a political system. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>Heaven</i>
contrasts with earth. The kingdom of heaven is not “of this world” (cp. John <b>18</b>:36).
If we buy into it, we can have blessedness whether we are rulers or subjects,
rich or poor, and so on. Identifying with God and his heavenly kingdom raises
us above the things that make for instability and gives us a power and
significance called <i>blessedness</i>.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Beatitudes 2 through 7
suggest a second source of blessedness. Jesus appeals to the future in all six
cases. Mourners will be comforted, the meek will inherit the earth, the hungry
will be fed, the merciful will receive mercy, the pure in heart will see God,
and the peacemakers will be called the children of God. The future does not
have to be after death or after the return of Messiah. It can be later during
time as well as later in eternity. The first source of blessedness appeals to
transcendence, which puts us above the flux, instability, and turmoil in this
world that work against blessedness. The second source of blessedness appeals
to the future, which gives us hope after the flux, instability, and turmoil
that work against blessedness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Sometimes it is hard
to believe that these really are ways to be blessed. Nevertheless, it helps to
know that a sickness we are experiencing will not afflict us permanently. In
fact, it may be over soon. By keeping the future in mind, we rise above the
present. Doing so gives us another way of looking at life that does not lock us
into the weaknesses of this order of things. Scripture appeals to the future as
a way of bailing out the present. The future gives us a dynamic in the present
even though the source of that dynamic is only a present idea about reality yet
to come. If we trust God, blessedness settles in upon us, not only because he
is more powerful than anything we have to face, but also because he has told us
ahead of time that what grieves us now will come to an end and we will be
comforted. Future comfort is even sweeter when it is experienced in contrast to
former discomfort. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Besides making
observations on the beatitudes collectively, we can also comment on them
individually. Most of them are easy enough to understand. The first beatitude
promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor in spirit. <i>Poor in spirit</i> is
not very clear, and commentators understand it variously. It probably describes
people who recognize their spiritual deficiencies. When we realize that we need
to grow because we are not everything we should be, that in itself brings
blessedness. We have the hope of heaven despite imperfection. Perhaps “in spirit”
should be taken with <i>blessed</i> instead of <i>poor</i>. That way the
statement would indicate that the poor—in material thing—are blessed
spiritually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Those who mourn can
feel blessed because they will be comforted. The country where Jesus lived had
many reasons for mourning. The ancient world did not have the medicines
available to much of the modern world; many died in infancy and in their younger
years. There were many widows and orphans who experienced the sorrows that go
with such conditions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The next beatitude
addresses the meek. Meekness includes inner security, which removes felt need to
clamor for attention to make ourselves feel significant. We can relax enough to
be ourselves without worrying that, if we do so, people will consider us insignificant.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>“Blessed are those
who hunger and thirst after righteousness”</i> is a vivid picture of a people’s
desire to be children of the God who is in heaven. Striving after the kind of
life he would have us lead glories him and benefits us. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>“Blessed are the
merciful.” </i>Sometimes it is a temptation not to forgive people. It seems
easier to hold things against them. But if they discover that we are merciful
toward their mistakes, they may be merciful toward ours. God operates on that
same principle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>“Blessed are the
pure in heart”</i> means there must be no deceit in us. Our motives are
honorable, and our purpose is to seek God. Peacemakers have a real source of
blessedness because making peace is really enjoyable. Helping to reconcile a
couple, a church, or neighbors gives a real sense of fulfillment.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Even in persecution we
can count ourselves blessed by remembering that many Old Testament prophets
were persecuted. It did not mean that God had abandoned them then or that they
were wrong religiously; nor does it mean that God has abandoned us now or that
we are out of relationship with him. It means that such things happen when
people stand for the truth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  So far, we have been
dealing with the beatitudes. The next verses address “responsibilities of the
kingdom,” which Jesus sets forth under the imageries of light and salt. Light
is a suggestive imagery. We know that when the sun is shining, life seems more
vibrant, and we feel more on top of things. Jesus’ point, however, is that
light enlightens. It shows us where we are, so we do not get disoriented or
hurt ourselves. It shows us where things are, so we can move properly in
relationship to them. At all times God’s people serve as a light to those who
are not his people. They demonstrate the difference it makes to be God’s offspring.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Salt imagery brings up
several possible meanings. Salt preserves, purifies, melts ice, helps keep us
healthy. It can be used to put out fire. But Jesus was concerned with salt’s
ability to flavor. Christians flavor their communities and their world because
they are sources of good influence. Consequently, this segment of the sermon is
a mission mandate. Living the blessed life demonstrates that God’s blessing
rests on us, and we act responsibly toward life and people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Living on a hill is
like living in a glass house. When we do something, we do not just do
something; we teach something. And when we teach something, we do not just
teach something; we commend something. Everyday life becomes demonstration
evangelism. Even though we are not vocational ministers, we perform an
important role in God’s kingdom on a day-in, day-out basis. We do
pre-evangelism, preparing the way for proclamation evangelism. People watch us
for a long time to see what kind of enlightenment and flavoring we are before
they are willing to listen sensitively to us or anyone who comes to them with
proclamation. Proclamation announces the salvation message and urges people to
accept Jesus as Messiah and identify themselves with God through him. Consequently,
all of us serve a vital preliminary role in our calling as God’s people. During
hard times people are more open to the gospel. Our long-time preparation
fosters later receptivity. Otherwise, those people will turn to something else
in times of change and uncertainty. Presence evangelism results even
unintentionally from our obedience to God in the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Verses 3-16 talk about
the blessedness that comes from identifying with God above and from
anticipating the future when he brings everything to fruition. Belonging to God
makes us well-off right now even in negative circumstances. In turn,
blessedness feeds into our responsibility to be light and salt in the world.</span></p>
