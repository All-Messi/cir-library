that did not occur to you. The idea is to practice interpretation skills rather
than to carry on research. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Many brain teasers do not deal with very
substantive issues and that is intentional. On matters that are not
controversial, our minds are not distracted with preconceived conclusions that
our solutions must fit with. The same mechanisms that we bring to bear on
non-controversial and admittedly secondary matters can then be used more deliberately
on substantive issues. These exercises on unimportant points provide
opportunities to practice using mechanisms and thought patterns on important
questions.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         In interpretation work, it is desirable to
look for more than one meaning. We can fall into the habit of stopping with the
first idea that comes to mind as if what automatically occurs first to us is
naturally the meaning. That may reflect intellectual laziness or a simplistic
assumption about the clarity of language communication. In working on alleged
discrepancies, <i>etc</i>., a reader does well to propose as many options as he
can think of. That keeps him from fixing on one “solution” too soon. As a
matter of fact, much of what interpretation ends up doing is limiting the range
of options rather than finding <u>the</u> interpretation of a text. (1) The
first step is to think up as many readings as possible. They may be thought of
on the basis of the wording taken by itself. (2) The next step is to see
whether any of these initial impressions are eliminated because they are <u>contradictory</u>
to the near and distant context or to the nature of the case. (3) The final
step is to see whether any of them are <u>foreign</u> to the context and to the
nature of the subject. By “foreign” we mean pertaining to a subject no relevant
to the present discussion and purpose of the author.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>        1.    According to Matthew <b>8</b>:5-13 a
centurion came to Jesus asking him to heal a sick servant. In Luke’s account <b>(7</b>:2-10)
he sends elders of the Jews asking Jesus to heal that servant. Did the
centurion come to Jesus or not? Which account is wrong here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>        2.    On the cross Jesus promised the
repentant thief that he would be with him in Paradise (Luke <b>23</b>:43). Later,
after the resurrection and before the ascension, he told Mary Magdalene not to
cling to him because he had not yet ascended to the Father (John <b>20</b>:17).
The Father is surely in Paradise, isn’t he? NOTE: the King James Version at
this point reads, <i>“Do not <u>touch</u> me,”</i> which is probably not the
point of Jesus’ comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>        3.    John <b>3</b>:17 claims that God did not
send his son into the world to judge the world; yet <b>9</b>:39 says that for
judgment Christ came into the world. What is the truth of the matter? Similar
passages are <b>5</b>:22; <b>8</b>:15; <b>12</b>:47-48; contrast Acts <b>17</b>:31.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>        4.    Psalm<b> 16</b>:10 says, <i>“You will
not leave my soul in Sheol, and you will not allow your [Holy One(s)/Beloved]
to see corruption”</i> (cp. Acts <b>2</b>:27; <b>13</b>:35). (There are some
less important manuscripts that read <i>Beloved</i> here; a few others read
plural on “holy ones.”) Jesus was in the tomb for three days (Matthew <b>27</b>:57-<b>28</b>:1);
cp. the case of Lazarus, whose body had been in the grave four days and his
sister feared it would be decaying and giving off an odor by that time (John <b>11</b>:39).</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>               Did Jesus not, in fact, resurrect but
was taken immediately to heaven after the burial? Would his body not have seen
corruption if it had lain entombed for at least thirty-four hours?</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>        5.    1 John <b>1</b>:8 declares, <i>“If we
say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.”</i> 1
John <b>3</b>:6 and <b>5</b>:18, however, say<i>, “Whoever abides in him does
not sin; whoever sins has not seen him or known him.” “We know that everyone
who has been begotten by God does not sin, but the One/one begotten by God
keeps him/himself and the Evil One does not touch him.”</i></span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>               Does the person who has been begotten
by God sin or not? (“One/one” is a variant translation depending on whether the
reference is to the “begotten one” of the previous clause or to Christ.)</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>        6.    Romans <b>13</b>:8 says, <i>“Do not owe
any person anything.” </i>Jesus commands his disciples not to turn away from
those who would borrow (Matthew <b>5</b>:42; Luke <b>6</b>:34-35). If you lend
money to someone, are you not causing him to sin by putting him in a situation
where he disobeys Paul’s commandment not to owe anyone anything?</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>        7.    According to Matthew <b>28</b>:2-6 an
angel descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and told the women to tell
Jesus’ disciples that he had risen from the dead. In Luke <b>24</b>:2-7 and
John <b>20</b>:12 there are <u>two</u> angels present in meeting the women as a
group and then Mary Magdalene alone at the tomb.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>               A similar thing happens between the
accounts of the blind man/men near Jericho; Matthew <b>20</b>:29-34 has <u>two</u>
blind beggars whereas Mark <b>10</b>:46-52 has <u>one</u>. In Matthew’s account
there are <u>two</u> Gadarene demoniacs (<b>8</b>:28-34), but in Mark <b>5</b>:1-20
and Luke <b>8</b>:26-39 there is <u>one</u>. Matthew <b>21</b>:2 mentions <u>two</u>
donkeys involved in the triumphal entry–a donkey and her colt, but Mark <b>11</b>:2
and Luke <b>19</b>:30 refer to only <u>one</u>. </span></p>

I tell you that tonight, <u>before the rooster crows</u>, you will deny me
three times”</i> (<b>26</b>:34); similarly, Luke <b>22</b>:34 says, <i>“I tell
you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you
know me.”</i> On the other hand, Mark <b>14</b>:30 words it somewhat
differently<i>: “Truly I tell you that today, this very night, <u>before the
rooster crows twice</u>, you will deny me three times.”</i></span></p>

Jesus three times before the rooster crows <u>twice</u> without denying him

Jesus not come to bring the fruit of the S/spirit?</span></p>
