<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Many
of the examples below raise issues that are not in themselves very important. We
offer them, however, as (1) “exercises” in hermeneutical creativity on matters
where frankly it does not hurt to be wrong. Besides, it is not healthy to get
in the habit of “dodging” critical issues because they impact (2) evaluating
biblical accuracy. Though the points themselves are often not significant,
their existence in a religious text does raise a point that <u>is</u>
significant—whether people can trust the biblical accounts. Distrusting them
for unnecessary reasons should be avoided, and we cannot legitimately trust
them without correct exegetical work as a means of properly avoiding
unnecessary criticism of scripture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On
many of these “brain teasers” more than one answer can account for the facts. The
aim is to produce as many such answers as possible, not to stop after hitting
on one. The value of this practice is that a later solution may better suit the
features of the problem, which a person will never notice if he stops when the
first plausible answer suggests itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Analogical
reasoning</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> can be applied only to the
extent of common areas between the objects compared. Christ conquers evil;
therefore no one will be lost because that would mean he failed. Failure is
always relative to purpose. If the purpose is to have people in positive interpersonal
relationships, then it involves their wills. Conquest (military or athletic)
does not involve the assent of others, but reconciliation does. So there is no
failure on God’s part—only on people’s part who refuse. Conquest and reconciliation
do not share enough common elements to make universalism (number of the ones
conquered) a legitimate inference.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Genesis <b>1</b> says that mankind was created last,
but in Genesis <b>2</b> he is created first. Which is it or is it neither? What
assumptions are involved in raising this question in the first place?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:67.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-67.5pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Consider a <u>topical <i>vs</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>2. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Consider also the question about <u>literary
genre</u>. If Genesis <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are separate parabolic
representations (in whatever degree of correlation to what actually occurred),
details—especially in comparisons between these two representations—are not to
be pressed because they are apt to be scenery in the presentation and are
present to round out the picture the author chose as the vehicle of expression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Genesis
<b>2</b>:18<i>: “It is not good that man should be alone.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        BUT</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.75in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:1
says, <i>“It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-58.5pt'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Genesis <b>2</b> is a <u>generality</u>;
Paul addresses an exceptional matter. In Corinthians he is speaking to a
situation where persecution could make married life more emotionally tempting
to apostasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Genesis may be more concerned with
social provision for one who, being created in the image of God, was
constituted with social need in personal wholeness. It is concerned with
interpersonal outlet more than sexual outlet. When God made that interpersonal
outlet, he made woman and thus provided for the most intimate form of the more
general need. Paul is speaking of marriage <i>per se</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Genesis <b>2</b> is talking about
what provides for the procreation of the race; Paul is concerned about the
preservation of the church. (?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In Genesis God was speaking of the
way human life as such was set up to be. As such it becomes a generality
statement whereas Paul was speaking about exceptional matters either because of
(a) the present distress associated with Christianity or (b) exceptional cases
where marriage could keep a person from more easily fulfilling the goals of
ministry. Paul does say, “Let every man and woman have their own spouse”; so he
recognizes the same generality that Genesis<b> 2</b> addresses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The translation in 1 Corinthians
could be “good” in the sense of all right or okay. You do not <u>have</u> to
get married to be a legitimate, full-fledged person. There is nothing wrong
with being single. It may be less ideal to be single given human nature, but it
is still good, particularly under the current conditions. Genesis was speaking
about the typical situation because it was dealing with God’s setting up the
system originally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Paul has eternity in view (<i>“the
fashion of this world is passing away”</i>); Genesis is talking about this
life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Paul may be contrasting the
Christian view of marriage with that of contemporary Judaism, which stressed
marriage as something necessary for making someone complete. It was also part
of the Near Eastern concern for progeny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8. <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The apostle probably means <u>good</u>
in contrast to another good rather than in contrast to bad—it is good not in
contrast but as an alternative. Both marriage and the single life are good <u>theologically</u>.
Later in the chapter, he says a person should remain in whatever state he was
in when he was converted. As far as Christianity is concerned, such states of
social existence are immaterial to goodness. The single state that he urges is
superior <u>pragmatically</u> because of present distress and ministry needs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>      1 Corinthians<b> 7</b> could be
read with an emphasis on <u>is</u>, so as to imply that Paul is guardedly
agreeing with a statement made in the Corinthians’ earlier letter to Paul that
may have said, <i>“Isn’t it good not to marry?”</i> Such a comment could have
been prompted by more Gnostic-oriented people in the church or from those
opponents of the ones who were forwarding the question to Paul. If this is the
scenario, Paul’s point sounds rather like Jesus’ answer to the disciples in
Matthew <b>19</b> when they propose that it would be better not to get married
if you could not get out of a bad marriage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>               If Paul’s lead sentence
in 1 Corinthians<b> 7</b> is responding to a context that was advocating
celibacy, his comment would be a qualified confirmation of the goodness of such
a viewpoint. The important qualification, however, is that celibacy is not to
be advocated as a <u>doctrine</u>—as asceticism does—but as a <u>practical
measure</u> for ministry and life in hard situations.</span></p>

viewpoint, in which matters are viewed in terms of the end result <i>vs</i>. as

A genetic connection with David’s present behavior and condition does not sound

Bathsheba incident. Why would he then appeal to a past condition at this point
in his life? If he were not regenerate now, does this appeal to his birth
amount to an explanation or justification? But that would not fit with his
remorse. Finally, David is discussing himself, not necessarily everybody.</span></p>

giving Israel political freedom. In fact, what he came to bring—peace with

Jesus brings conflict because of the rejection of his message by some, after
which a greater peace comes than would have come without the message that

by being more detailed, had rooster crowing refer to the individual crowings. Obviously,
mark’s more detained narrative, as far as the rooster crowing goes, has to be
the way it really happened. Luke and Matthew are therefore less accurate, but
their accounts are still accurate. In keeping with this idea, some commentators
have said that “rooster crowing” becomes the label for one of the watches of
the night. Under this reconstruction, Matthew and Luke make “rooster crow: into

connection; he goes ahead with his denials twice again. When the rooster crowed

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jesus healed Malchus to teach the
disciples a lesson about the kingdom more than to engender or enhance Malchus’
faith. Engendering and enhancing faith had always previously been the design of
Jesus’ miracles. Being a teaching miracle, it “righted a wrong” in the sense
that Peter had sent Jesus’ captors the wrong message. It would not necessarily
have been wrong for Jesus to defend himself, but under the circumstances he
could not do that without communicating the wrong thing about the kingdom he
came to establish; it <i>“was not of this world”</i> (John<b> 18</b>:36). Jesus
probably had the disciples bring a sword to Gethsemane in anticipation of this
very kind of scene. He could then most graphically teach them as well as his
captors that his kingdom was not national, political, or militaristic. It was
not the type that could further its purposes by force.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The point of this comparison has
to do with the nature of the necessity for faith on the part of the recipient
of miraculous manifestation. Jesus could not do the mighty works in Nazareth
because there was no point, given the principle of doing them to engender or
enhance faith in his claims. The Mark statement may relate more to a lack of
healing because not many were willing to <u>come</u> to him for healing. They
considered him the same old carpenter he had always been, someone that was now
trying to make himself something more than what he really was.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jesus did nature miracles, whose
value lies along the very line of concern here because the effect could not
have depended on the faith of the recipient. Nature miracles could not be
psychosomatically produced and so the effect could not depend on the thing
affected. The resurrection of Lazarus, the widow of Nain’s son, and Jairus’
daughter; walking on the water, stilling the storm, predicting the future,
cursing the fig tree had the same import.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As a rule, Jesus chose not to heal
under conditions when others were taking the initiative rather than he, as in
Luke <b>22</b>:51. He could not heal in Nazareth because of inconsistency with
that principle. Note the difference between naturally unable, circumstantially
unable, and principle-wise unable and at the same time maintain consistency.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>He <u>did</u> perform miracles in
Nazareth; he just did not do very many. The inference is not that success
depends on the faith of the receiver, or that failure implies a lack in the
recipient’s faith, or that he could not do it without the recipient’s faith. His
<u>power</u> to heal was not limited by people; his <u>use</u> of that power
was limited by principle—by people’s unwillingness or lack of faith.</span></p>

people who do not progress in their understanding so they can help other people
understand; James objects to people who are too eager to lead and tell. The
succeeding context in James warns about the tongue that cannot be tamed, and
the preceding context objects to substituting belief for behavior. In James
there is a concern about tellers whose commitments do not push them to be doers
(cp. James<b> 2</b>); they tell but don’t do. A person should not teach if he
does not know what he is talking about and if he is not living what he teaches.
Some people are not concerned to take responsibility; others try to take
responsibilities they are not prepared for. Hebrews means that people should
grow so they can teach; James means that people should not teach because they
have not grown. One group is not seeking to minister; the other is trying to
minister for the wrong reasons. Unworthy motives can explain why people try to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:-.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Hebrews<b> 4</b>:15 says that Jesus was
tempted in all points such as we are, yet without sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>   A person might be tempted to infer that Jesus was
not deity; yet the same book has one of the strongest statements about his
deity (Hebrews <b>1</b>:8; cp. John<b> 1</b>:1;<i> etc</i>.).</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Part of the issue here relates to
the meaning of <i>tempt</i>. The word <i>tempt</i> can mean (1) to present with
something intended to get to do what he should not do; it can mean (2) to
present with something that actually creates in the person a sense of being
lured; and it can mean (3) to present with something that succeeds in causing a
person to succumb to the lure. Of course, anyone could be presented with a
temptation that the other person tries to use to get him to sin; so James means
“tempt” in the second or third sense. Since the text goes on to say that a man
is <i>“drawn away by his own lust,”</i> James probably means that physical
things do not offer any lure to God because he is spiritual. There is nothing
wrong with being presented with a lure (sense #1) and there is nothing wrong
with feeling the pull of a temptation; sin enters the picture only when a
person gives in to the temptation (#3).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>This last point leads to a second
part of the issue, which involves a distinction between non-incarnate and
incarnate deity. The difference between the incarnate and non-incarnate states
could explain the difference between Hebrews <b>4</b>:15 and James <b>1</b>:13.
The Hebrew writer is talking about Jesus during his time among us in the flesh.
In that state he faced hunger, thirst, and the other bodily drives; he was
lured by the concern about pain, as the struggle in Gethsemane shows. If that
were not the case, he would not have experienced what it was to be human, and
he would not have been prepared by human experiences in such a way that we can
be sure he understands what we are going through. Knowing that he faced those
things and struggled with them is what makes him able to help us when we are
tempted (Hebrews<b> 2</b>:18). We understand that if he succeeded against this
temptation, so can we.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The answer to the problem,
then, is to say that it is in the non-incarnate state that James means God
cannot be lured-tempted by temptation (#2); but the Hebrew writer's point is
that God in the person of Jesus Christ was lured-tempted by various temptations
(#2) but did not give in to them (#3). </span></p>

blood that covers sins? Does that imply that the multitude of sins belong to
the converter? If they belong to the converter, covering them by converting
another would not be meant in a way that would allow the converter to count on
making up for his sins in a quantitative way. The sense in which it would be
true of the converter’s sin would be as follows: In the converter’s efforts to
convert someone, God could see where the converter’s heart is. In other words,
efforts at trying to help someone else indicate his own sense of identity with
Christ and concern for righteousness.</span></p>

A loving person wants the best for others and wants to accentuate the positive

things from which he must work to get better yet. Love does not criticize
because it does not focus on faults. A comparison can be made with Luke <b>7</b>:47,
where Jesus says, <i>“Her sins, which are many, are forgiven because she loved
much.”</i> Whoever is forgiven little loves little. Forgiven much because loved
much; loved much because forgiven much (cp. <b>7</b>:41-42).</span></p>

about this condition. The alternative John is concerned with is that sinning is
irrelevant (1 John <b>3</b>) and therefore of no concern to Christians. If sin
were of no concern, we would be characteristically caught up in it. Gnostics
taught that sin was indifferent and that they were above sin. The two comments
of John correspond with these Gnostic notions.</span></p>
