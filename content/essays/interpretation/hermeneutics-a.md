of texts often comes in terms of the assumed overall viewpoints, more than by
the requirements of the text under discussion. Hence, we can’t solve the
problem itself because we are not dealing with the whole viewpoint that gives
credence to the idea on this text.</p>

approach to an unacceptable view is to show that each text used to support it can
be handled in a way that fits with another view. When all the texts so used
have been addressed in this way, no basis remains for the questionable idea. So,
it is not a matter of <i>disproving</i>, but of showing that the other view
cannot shoulder its positive burden of proof; so the view is at best a matter
of opinion because it is a viewpoint based on inadequate evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'>A couple of notes,
though. The objections to each text should themselves fit together with an
alternative viewpoint. Someone with another take on these several passages
needs to shoulder his <i>own</i> positive burden of proof for that other view. Additionally,
any proposed idea must fit with the text and context under consideration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'>The total task
calls for establishing the overall viewpoint that will in many cases in turn dictate
the possible meanings for the texts in question. At the level of the whole
(viewpoint) is where it is particularly important to have primary proof more
than confirmatory evidence; otherwise, the interpretation process is rooted in
the (1) interpreter’s personality rather than in (2) the Big Picture or in (3)
specific clear texts.</p>
