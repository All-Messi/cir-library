How the Heart Is Hardened


James <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:13-14: God does not tempt us. Our temptations come from being drawn away by our own desires as a residual effect of previous sin. What we are like causes us to react like we do.

Hebrews <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:13:	 hardened by the deceitfulness of sin


<em>“Hardening”</em> means <em>“insensitivity, unwillingness to listen.” </em>


Pharaoh’s heart was hardened by the plagues that should have changed it.

Pharaoh hardened his heart in response to the plagues that should have changed it.

God hardened Pharoah’s heart with plagues that should have changed it.


God did not just come in and take the Israelites out. The plagues provided him an opportunity to demonstrate his power over Pharaoh and the Egyptian gods and to do so in front of the Israelites, who did not suffer those plagues. That pattern of the plagues showed Yahweh’s existence, his supremacy, and his preference for Israel. They did so; he blessed them before he commanded them to serve him at Sinai.

The LORD did not just come in and destroy Egypt to accomplish his purpose. He gave Pharoah a chance to choose to let the Israelites go. He explained the point of the miracles; he did not just plague Egypt to be mean. Letting Israel go could have happened without destroying the land, its people, its resources, and its military defenses.

God not only showed his power in initiating the plagues, but even his good faith toward Pharaoh by stopping plagues when Pharaoh entreated him to do so with the frogs (Exodus <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:8-13), the flies (<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:28-31), the hail (<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:28-33), the locusts (<strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:17-19). God withdrew the plagues after repeated acts of bad faith on Pharaoh’s part (<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:15, 32; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:34; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:20; note <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:5-9 as well).

Yahveh did not give just one but many signs and with growing power as they went on—cumulative and increasingly obvious and powerful, culminating in the plague of darkness and the death of the first-born, not to mention the destruction of Egypt’s army in the Red Sea. These plagues were miracles, wonders, and signs—miracles in that they were supernatural in cause, wonders in their impact on observers, and signs in carrying meaning.


How God Hardened Pharaoh’s Heart


Exodus <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:1-9 Pharaoh’s heart was hardened.

Who hardened it?

God hardened it.

How did God harden it?

Indirectly (<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:14) by turning the Israelites around into what Pharaoh would think would box them in. What should not have been a temptation was a temptation for him. What Pharaoh was like, caused how he responded—hardening his own heart like he did.


Two Relevant Concepts


About God: purpose and result collapse together under divine omniscience (Exodus <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:9; cp. John <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:3).

God does not do something and then get surprised by its consequences. He knew ahead of the whole process how Pharaoh would react (Exodus <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:21) all the way to the death of his first-born (<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:22-23).


About Hebrew idiom: direct and indirect, initiated and allowed, are acts worded the same

way (Job <strong>1-2</strong>, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>; cp. Genesis<strong> 43</strong>:23;<strong> 45</strong>:5, 8; Exodus <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:3-4; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:12-14; Judges<strong> 21</strong>:15; John <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:11).
