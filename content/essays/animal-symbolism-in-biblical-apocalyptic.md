ANIMAL SYMBOLISM IN BIBLICAL APOCALYPTIC

Introduction

Within prophecy generally, apocalyptic has several distinguishing characteristics. As to content, apocalyptic deals with eschatological reference, angelic emphasis, cataclysm, universal-cosmic scope, pessimism in people, divine sovereignty, transcendence, the concept of final comfort. As to form, apocalyptic uses animal symbolism and numerology.

In chronological order the apocalyptic passages in scripture are Isaiah 24-27 (+ 6); Ezekiel 33-48 especially; Daniel 2, 7-12; Zechariah generally (although in many places the book is non-apocalyptic prophecy); the Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24-25, Mark 13, and Luke 21; 1 Thessalonians 4:1-5:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12; and the Book of Revelation generally.

I. Animals Mentioned in Biblical Apocalyptic

A.	Bear: Daniel 7:5; Revelation 13:2

B.	Bird (ἄρνεον): Revelation 18:2

C.	Dogs: Revelation 22:15

D.	Dragon: Revelation 12:3, 4, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17; 13:2, 4, 11; 16:13; 20:2

E.	Eagle: Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14; Daniel 7:4; Matthew 24:28 (= Luke 17:37, “vultures”); Revelation 4:7; 12:14

F.	Frogs: Revelation 16:13

G.	He-goat: Daniel 8:5, 21; Zechariah 10:3, 5

H.	Horse: Zechariah 1:82; 6:2-3, 6; Revelation 6:2, 4, 5, 6; 9:7, 9, 172, 19; 14:20

I.	Lamb: Revelation 5:6, 8, 12, 13; 6:1, 16; 7:9, 10, 14, 17; 12:11; 13:8, 11; 14:1, 42, 10; 15:3; 17:14; 19:7, 9; 21:9, 14, 22, 23, 27; 22:1, 3

J.	Leopard: Revelation 13:2; Daniel 7:6

L.	Ox: Ezekiel 1:10

Calf: Ezekiel 1:7; Revelation 4:7

M.	Ram: Daniel 8:3, 4, 6, 73, 20

N.	Scorpions: Revelation 9:3, 5, 10

O.	Serpent: Isaiah 27:12; Revelation 12:9, 14, 15; 20:2

P.	Sheep-flock: Zechariah 13:7; 9:16; 10:2, 3; 11:4, 72, 11, 17

The above listing yields some observations. (1) Several apocalyptic sections do not include animal symbolism: Isaiah’s “little apocalypse,” the Olivet Discourse (except in the one aphoristic statement about “vultures”), and Paul’s apocalyptic sections. (2) By far the greatest amount of animal symbolism occurs in Daniel and Revelation. (3) The six most frequently used animals are the lion, dragon, eagle, horse, lamb, and sheep, although some seventeen animals appear in the symbolism. (4) Both domesticated and wild animals come into the scenes. (5) Not all animals in apocalyptic sections are symbolic: horses in Zechariah 10:3, 5; 12:42; 14:15, 20; camel, mule, and donkey in 14:15.

II. Inter-Identification of the Beasts of Revelation

A.  Basic proposition: there are only three “beasts” in all.

1.  16:13 (source of three frog-like unclean spirits): the dragon, the beast, the

false prophet

2.  19:19-20:3: the beast (19:19-20), the false prophet (19:20), the dragon, the old 			     		serpent, Devil, Satan (20:2)

3.   20:10: the devil that deceived them, the beast, the false prophet

B.  Beasts mentioned in Revelation

1.  The (great red) dragon: 12:1-17; 16:13; 20:1-3, 7-10

2.  The sea beast: 13:1-10

3.  The earth beast: 13:11-18

4.  The beast in 11:7

5.  The beast with an image: 14:9-12

6.  The false prophet: 16:13; 19:20; 20:10

7.  The scarlet-colored beast: 17:3-18

C.  The identification of the beasts

1.  The “earth beast” (13:11-18) equals the false prophet (16:13; 19:20).

a.  	Both worked signs in the sight of the beast (13:13-15; 19:20).

b.  	Prophet is an appropriate term for a beast that spoke on behalf of another

(13:12, 14b, 15b-17; 16:13; 15:20).

c.  Only three satanic creatures appear in Interlude I (12:1-14:20) ahead of the list in 16:13. The first being was a definite reference and the other two are most naturally in the same order as they appeared in the earlier text. The only other single beast prior to chapter 12 is in 11:7, the one coming up out of the abyss. Abyss is a word not previously used in Revelation except in connection with the locust hordes in 9:1, 2, 11; hence, it looks forward to the beast introduced in Interlude I.

2.  	The earth beast (13:11-18) does not equal the sea beast (13:1-10).

a.  The text speaks of him as “another beast” (13:11) and the “first beast” 						(13:12).

b.  The earth beast performs signs in the sight of the sea beast (13:12, 14).

c.  The earth beast causes people to worship the image of the sea beast

(13:15).

3.  The dragon (12:1-17; 16:13; 20:1-3, 7-10) does not equal the sea beast (13:1-

10), because the dragon gave him his power, throne, and great authority (13:2).

4. 	The scarlet-colored beast (17:3-18) does not equal the dragon (12:1-17; 16:13;

20:1-3, 7-10).

a.  	The dragon is Satan (12:9), a person; but the scarlet-colored beast is a composite of person, place, and things; that is, the “beast” itself (20:11), seven hills (20:9), and an evil political system (20:10-11a). The heads are both mountains and kings (20:9-10).

b.  	Two different animal words are used. One is a “dragon” (δράκων, drakōn); the other is a beast (θήριον, thērion). Δράκων indicates undomesticated animals generally (mammal, 13:2; snake, Acts 28:4-5).

5.  The sea beast (13:1-10) equals the scarlet-colored beast (17:3-18).

a.  The sea beast came up out of the sea (13:1); the harlot who sat on the beast (17:3) was sitting on many waters (17:2).

b.  Both had seven heads and ten horns (13:1; cp. 17:3).

c. 	The sea beast had names of blasphemy on his heads (13:1, 6); the scarlet-colored beast was “full of names of blasphemy” (17:3). Blasphemy is associated only with these two beasts.

d. 	The sea beast had one head smitten but the death-stroke was healed (13:3); the scarlet beast was, is not, and will come out of the abyss.

e.  Only the sea-beast section (13:8) and the scarlet-beast section (17:8) contain the phrase not written in the (Lamb’s) book of life, except for references near the beginning of the book and at the actual judgment scenes near the end of Revelation.

f.  	After mentioning the healed death-stroke, the text says that “the whole earth” marveled at the beast (13:3). After stating that the scarlet beast was, is not, and is to come, the angel says that “they who dwell on the earth” will marvel at the beast (17:8).  (Μέλλω + infinitive may be a New Testament Greek formula for near future vs. distant future: “be about to”; hence, the beast “was, is not, and is about to come.” The normal Greek future verb is undifferentiated future.)

6.  	The sea beast (13:1-10) equals the beast with an image (14:9-12) because they

both have an image made of them (13:14-15; 14:9).

7.  	The sea beast (13:1-10) equals the beast in 11:7.

a. 	They both overcome the saints (11:7; 13:7), the only two places in

Revelation where saints are said to be overcome.

b.  	The sea beast has been shown to equal the scarlet beast. These three beasts arise voluntarily. No key is used to free them to accomplish God’s purposes (11:7; 17:8, 10).

c.  	Both have authority over peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations (11:9; 13:7).

The first difficulty in this identification is that no other single beast (θήριον [thērion]) ascends from the abyss. The θήριον of 11:7, however, cannot be a separate beast because that would make at least four beasts in Revelation. The text seems to allow for only three beasts when all identifications have been made. The δράκων does not come out of the abyss after the millennium because it is released from its prison, the abyss. But the dragon’s release from the abyss does not seem to fit the 11:7 statement exactly for the following reasons:

(1) 	It is a θήριον (undomesticated animal) rather than a δράκων [drakōn] that is to come up, or arise.

(2) 	The θήριον from the sea seems to triumph over the saints after his coming up, whereas the dragon does not succeed against God after the millennium.

(3) 	The θήριον of 11:7 seems to arise freely from his “abyss,” whereas

Satan is released from the abyss after the millennium.

(4) 	The beast and the false prophet are thrown directly into the lake of

fire and sulfur immediately after their defeat by the King of Kings.

(5) 	The δράκων is distinguished from the sea beast of whom the scarlet beast is the presumed equal, and it is said of the scarlet beast also (17:8) that he comes up from the abyss.

The difficulty here may be overcome by making the abyss of 11:7 the same as the sea of 13:1 from which the sea beast arises.

(1) The Septuagint used ἄβυσσος (abyssos) to translate תְּהוֹם (“the deep”) in Genesis 1:2. “The deep” in that passage means the sea, because dry land has not yet appeared. There are considerable affinities between the creation and consummation accounts.

(2) 	In Romans 10:7 Paul calls Christ’s grave an abyss as a parallel to Deuteronomy 30:11-14, where the sea is mentioned. Ἄβυσσος occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in Luke 8:31, where Legion request Jesus not to send them into the abyss; yet they run into the sea.

A second difficulty comes from identifying the sea beast (13:1-10) with the beast in 11:7: coming out of the abyss is future in 17:8, four chapters after the sea beast arises. Since, however, the scarlet beast equals the sea beast, events signified in 17:1ff. are probably an amplification of 13:1ff.

In summary, one beast is called a dragon, a second is called the earth beast and false prophet, and a third is called the sea beast, beast (11:7), beast with an image, and scarlet-colored beast.

C.  Cherub + man + lion + eagle: Ezekiel 10:1-22

D.  Lion + eagle +man: Daniel 7:4

E.  Leopard + wings: Daniel 7:6

F.  Iron teeth + horns + brass nails: Daniel 7:7-8, 11, 17-27

H. 	 Lion-lamb: Revelation 5:5-8, 12-13; 6:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16-17; 7:9-10, 14, 17;

12:11; 13:8; 14:1, 4, 10; 15:3; 17:14; 19:7, 9; 21:9, 14, 22-23, 27; 22:1, 3.

I.  Locust + scorpion + horse + man + woman + lion: Revelation 9:3-11

J.  Horse + lion + serpent: Revelation 9:15-21

K.  Leopard + bear + lion: Revelation 13:1-10

L.  Lamb + dragon: Revelation 13:11-18

The three descriptions of the four beings (archangels?) vary in the details of the symbolism, but the animals are the same. The number of wings varies from four to six. The relationship of the animal features also changes. Whereas John and Isaiah make the four beasts individually man, lion, calf, eagle, Ezekiel makes each one have all these features.

V. The sea beast in Revelation strongly resembles the non-descript beast of Daniel 7 and

the legs of the statue in Daniel 2.

VII. General Observations and Conclusions

A.  Elements are sufficiently repetitious to imply either (a) that the repetition is intentional or (b) that the visions were similar. Two possibilities exist in such a case: either the later author gives a similar description because it is as appropriate to his own subject as it was to the previous event from which he draws his terminology, or he hints that he speaks of the same thing as his predecessor.

The second alternative seems especially likely when (1) several parallels can be drawn between the two prophecies; (2) when the previous prophecy was not fulfilled by the time the second author wrote; (3) when the thing prophesied is not something that would recur frequently; (4) when the parallels themselves are not common things; and (5) when notable expressions do not appear elsewhere in scripture.

Care must be taken in identification, however. The dragon of Revelation 12 has seven heads, ten horns, and (seven) diadems. The sea beast of Revelation 13 also has seven heads, ten horns, and (ten) diadems. Nevertheless, they are not the same thing, because the dragon gives the sea beast his power (13:2). Though related, they are not identical.

B.  	Animal symbolism comes mostly in Daniel and Revelation.

C. In these animal symbols, something out of character is almost always present.  Frequently the “beasts” are composites of different animals, as with John’s description of the “locusts” in Revelation 9. Sometimes animal and human features combine, as with the strong angel of Revelation 10. Animal and mineral combine in Daniel’s fourth beast, which had iron teeth and brass claws (nails, 7:19). Daniel’s fourth beast and Ezekiel’s living creatures combine various animal characteristics with both human and mineral elements. Some examples have something just plain “odd,” such as the three ribs between the bear’s teeth in Daniel 7:5 or unrealistic colors like the pale green horse of Revelation 6.

D.  Time wise, animal symbolism (indeed apocalyptic itself) comes primarily from the time of the seventy-year exile (Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah) and the first seventy years of the apostolic age. Apocalyptic appears almost exclusively in Jesus’ Olivet Discourse during his final week. Even there, practically no animal symbolism comes up. Pauline apocalyptic also lacks this rather “exotic” touch. Perhaps this pattern is because animal symbolism is used mostly in the narration of apocalyptic visions, where the author is presumably in a state of ecstasy observing visual enactments before his mind’s eye.

The apocalyptic imagery of subsequent apocalyptic follows previous use of symbolism, perhaps even builds on it. The “locusts” of Revelation 9 may reflect the symbolism in Joel. Sometimes imagery is reminiscent of pre-apocalyptic, or non-apocalyptic, notably the serpent symbolism for Satan (cp. Genesis 3) and the Lamb symbolism for Christ (cp. sacrifice laws).

Generally speaking, there does not seem to be much development in apocalyptic animal symbolism. Composites appear from Ezekiel onward. Good-connotation symbolism comes from that time as well; Isaiah has good connotations associated with the seraphs, who elsewhere appear in apocalyptic contexts.

E.  	On the whole, more can be said about elements of continuity in apocalyptic than can be said about development.

1. 	Generally animal symbolism carries bad connotation, two-thirds of the time, according to the enumeration in Chart IV.

2. 	Horns usually indicate kings; beasts frequently indicate whole kingdoms.

3. 	Undomesticated animals predominate two to one in the examples above.

4. 	Domesticated animals do not always carry good connotations, as one might expect. Only five of the twelve domesticated animals give positive images. Conversely, seven of the twenty-four wild animals carry good connotations; so undomesticated animals do tend to connote bad things, but only in keeping with the predominance of evil connotation for animal symbolism generally.

5.  In the previous charts, equations were made between the different animal symbols. They may be brought together in this manner:

a.  	Lamb (Christ)

b.	Satan = the devil = the serpent

c.  	The four living creatures = seraphs = cherubs

d.  	The lion-eagle-man of Daniel 7:4 (Babylonian Empire)

e.  	The bear of Daniel 7:5 = the ram of Daniel 9 (Medo-Persia)

f.  	The leopard of Daniel 7:6 = the he-goat of Daniel 8 (Greek—Alexander

the Great and his successors)

g. 	The sea beast = beast of Revelation 11:7 = beast with an image = the

scarlet-colored beast = non-descript beast of Daniel 7 (Rome ff.?)

h.  The earth beast = false prophet

i.  	Locust-scorpion-horn-man-woman-lion of Revelation 9

As a result, nine discrete symbolizations appear in biblical apocalyptic: the twenty-four elders, the two witnesses, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit left as never represented in apocalyptic animal symbolism. In conclusion, apocalyptic writers tended to express “things” in animal symbolism.

APPENDIX

Three numbers occur in apocalyptic that seem to indicate the same time period: forty-two months; 1260 days; and time, times, and a half. The first appears in Luke 21:24; Revelation 11:2; 13:5. Revelation 11:3 and 12:6 mention 1260 days. Time, times, and a half shows up in Daniel 7:25; 12:7; and Revelation 12:14.

Forty-two months refers to the same period as 1260 days (1) since 1260 days make forty-two months of thirty days each. (2) Revelation 11:2 + 3 juxtapose these numbers, saying that Jerusalem is trodden underfoot for forty-two months immediately before saying that the two witnesses prophesy 1260 days.

Time, times, and a half equal 1260 since the woman who bore the man child and fled from the dragon was nourished in the wilderness for 1260 days (Revelation 12:6). In Revelation 12:14 the statement is repeated, using time, times, and half a time. Such a curious number must mean the same era in Daniel 7:25 and 12:7, both of which describe end times (fourth kingdom and resurrection passages).

If these equations are correct, certain matters occur simultaneously:

(a) 	The length of time during which the saints of the Most High are given into the hands of the “fourth beast,” before the kingdom is given to the saints (Daniel 7:23-27)

(b) 	The time of breaking in pieces the holy people referred to by the man in linen

who hovered above the River Chebar in Babylon (Daniel 12:5-9)

(c) 	The “time of the Gentiles” during which Jerusalem would be trodden under foot (from A.D. 70) and the Jews were captives of the nations (Luke 21:24; Revelation 11:2).

(d) 	The duration of the prophesying by the “two witnesses” (“Moses” and

“Elijah”? Revelation 11:3)

(e) 	The time during which the woman arrayed with the sun (Israel?) is nourished

in the wilderness (Revelation 12:6, 14).

These conclusions being true, the sea beast of Revelation 13:1-10 corresponds to the fourth beast of Daniel 7:7-8, 11-12, 19-27 by length of rule and other marks charted above.
