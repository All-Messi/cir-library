Jennifer Chantell Wenzl

On behalf of the Wenzls, I want to thank you for this wonderful demonstration of support for the family and for such an overwhelming expression of love for Jenny in this time of intense sorrow.

Grief is our response to loss, and the deepest loss is the loss of a person.

Our sense of loss is primarily over a loss of who someone in relation to us.

Identity:  Who she is.

Our identity is what counts.  It is out of who we are that flow our deeds and our words.
