Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1The Words of the Preacher, Ben-David, King in Jerusalem

2“Completely pointless,” the Preacher says;

“Completely pointless! It’s all pointless.”

3What do people get out of their work under the sun?

4One generation passes away and another comes along,

but the earth just goes on and on.

5The sun comes up, the sun goes down,

and hurries back to where it comes up again.

6The wind blows south, the wind blows north;

it just keeps circulating around and around. 		Eccl 1:1-6

7The rivers flow to the ocean; yet the ocean doesn’t run over;

they flow again to where they flowed before.

8Everything is too tiresome to talk about;

eyes aren’t satisfied by seeing;

ears aren’t fulfilled by hearing.

9What has been is what will be;

what’s been done is what’ll be done;

there’s nothing new under the sun.

10Is there anything you can say,

“Look, that’s new”?

11People don’t remember the past;

later, they won’t remember the future either.

The ones that come after you won’t remember you. 	Eccl 1:7-11

12I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13I decided to examine with wisdom everything people do under the sky. It’s a grievous job God has stricken them with. 14I’ve looked at everything they do under the sun. It’s all pointless, like chasing the wind.

15What’s crooked you can’t straighten;

what’s missing you can’t get back.

16I said to myself,

“I’m wiser than anybody that’s ruled Jerusalem before;

I’ve gained a wealth of knowledge.”

17I determined to experience everything from wisdom to madness and pointless behavior. I came to realize that it’s all like chasing the wind.

18There’s much grief in much wisdom;

increasing knowledge increases pain.                 		Eccl 1:12-18

2:1I said to myself, “Try pleasure; enjoy yourself.” That turned out to have no purpose either. 2Laughing’s silly and pleasure’s pointless. 3I cast about in my mind how to cheer myself up with wine and embrace foolishness while thinking wisely.

I tried to find out what’s worth doing under the sky during the few years we’re alive. 4I undertook big projects:

I built houses for myself;

I planted vineyards for myself;

5I made gardens and parks for myself,

planted all kinds of fruit trees in them,

6and built ponds to irrigate the trees;

7I bought male and female slaves and had home-born slaves;

I owned bigger flocks and herds than anyone before me in Jerusalem;

8I collected silver and gold and the treasure from kings and provinces;

I provided for myself male and female singers and lots of concubines—men’s pleasure.

9So I became great and surpassed everybody before me in Jerusalem, as my wisdom stayed with me. 10I took whatever I saw that I wanted. I didn’t deprive myself of any pleasure because I was pleased with my work and pleasure was my reward for it. 11Then I looked at what I’d done and the effort I’d put into doing it. It was pointless, like chasing the wind. I hadn’t gained anything under the sun.			  Eccl 2:1-11

12So I compared wisdom to madness and fun; who can have more of that than a king? 13I saw that wisdom excels fun as much as light excels darkness. 14The wise can see where they’re going, but the foolish walk around in the dark; yet both share the same fate. 15I said, “The fate of a fool will come to me too; so what’s the point of being wise?” 16There’s no more lasting memory of the wise than of the foolish. Later on, everybody will fade from memory. The wise and the foolish both die! 17So I despised life because my work under the sun brought me grief. Everything’s pointless, like chasing the wind.     	  Eccl 2:12-17

18So I despised everything I’d worked for under the sun because I’ll have to leave it to other people. 19Who knows if they’ll be wise or foolish? Yet they’ll control everything I worked for in wisdom under the sun. It’s pointless. 20So I let myself despair over everything I worked for under the sun. 21After people labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, they have to leave it to somebody that didn’t work for it. It’s pointless, a great misfortune. 22What do people get out of their hard work and striving under the sun? 23Their whole life is painful and grievous. Even at night their mind doesn’t rest. It’s all so pointless.

24There’s nothing better than to eat and drink and get satisfaction out of your work. I’ve seen even that comes from God; 25apart from him, who can eat and enjoy anything? 26He gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to the ones he considers good. He gives sinners the job of accumulating wealth to give to the ones he considers good. That’s pointless too, like chasing the wind.				     Eccl 2:18-26

3:1There’s a time for everything under the sky:

2a time to be born and a time to die;

a time to plant and a time to uproot what’s planted;

3a time to kill and a time to heal;

a time to build and a time to tear down;

4a time to laugh and a time to cry;

a time to dance and a time to mourn;

5a time to gather stones and a time to throw them away;

a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;

6a time to search and a time to quit searching;

a time to keep and a time to throw away;

7a time to rip apart and a time to sew together;

a time to speak and a time to be quiet;

8a time to love and a time not to love;

a time for peace and a time for war.

9What do workers get out of work? 10I’ve seen the job God has given people to occupy themselves. 11He’s set an appropriate time for everything and planted eternity in their hearts, but in a way that they can’t see his work beginning to end. 	Eccl 3:1-11

12I realize there’s nothing better for people than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live. 13There’s nothing better than eating and drinking and taking pleasure in their work—that’s God’s gift. 14Everything God does is final. There’s nothing to add or take away, because he has worked in such a way that people should respect him. 15What will be has already been, because God does again what he’s done before.

16Besides, I’ve seen that in place of justice and goodness there’s wickedness under the sun. 17I said to myself,

“God will judge the good and the bad because he’s appointed a time for everything. 18He tests them so they can see they’re no better than animals.”

19People and animals have the same fate: one dies like the other; they both have to breathe. People don’t have any advantage. 20They both came from dust, and they’ll go back to it. 21Who knows if a person’s spirit goes up and an animal’s spirit goes down into the ground? 22I’ve seen that there’s nothing better for people than to be happy in what they do; that’s their lot. Who can make them see what’ll happen when they’re gone?  	  Eccl 3:12-22

4:1Then I looked at the oppression that’s under the sun and saw the tears of the oppressed that have no comforters because their oppressors have the power. 2So I decided the dead are better off than the living, 3and the ones that never existed are better off yet.

4I saw that competition between people drives work and achievement. That's pointless too, like chasing the wind. 5Fools fold their hands, so their bodies atrophy. 6One handful with quietness is better than two with toil—and chasing the wind.

7I saw something else that’s pointless under the sun: 8people with nobody that needs them—offspring or sibling, yet they work as hard as they can to get wealth, but to no end because wealth doesn’t satisfy them: “Who am I working for? Who am I depriving myself of enjoyment for?” It’s all meaningless and depressing.	           Eccl 4:1-8

9Two are better than one because they can get more done. 10If either falls, the other can help; misfortune awaits whoever doesn’t have anybody that can help. 11Besides, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; how can one keep warm alone? 12A bully can overpower someone that’s alone, but two can resist. A cord with three strands doesn’t break easily.

13A poor, wise youth is better off than a foolish old king who doesn’t know how to accept instruction anymore. 14A youth can come out of prison to become king, though he was born in poverty. 15But I’ve seen people throng to the next young man to replace him, 16and there’s no end to his successors. But people won’t be happy with those successors either. That whole scenario is pointless, too, like chasing the wind.           	 Eccl 4:9-16

5:1When you go to God’s Temple, go there to listen rather than offer mindless sacrifice and not realize you’re sinning. 2Don’t think impulsively or speak rashly in God’s presence. He’s in heaven, you’re on earth; so don’t say too much. 3Working too much fosters false dreams, and talking too much makes you a fool. 4When you make a vow to God, don’t delay paying it. He doesn’t delight in fools; pay what you vow. 5It’d be better not to vow than not to pay it. 6Don’t sin in what you say; don’t say in God’s presence that you misspoke. Why have him angry with what you say and destroy your work? 7When daydreams grow and words multiply, emptiness comes. Respect God, instead.     	Eccl 5:1-7

8Don’t be shocked if you see the poor oppressed and justice denied in the realm. One official oversees another official, higher officials oversee them, 9and the king that cultivates the land to his own advantage.

10People that love money aren’t satisfied with money; those who love wealth aren’t satisfied with wealth. That’s pointless too. 11The more you make, the more people there are that want to get you to spend it. So what’s the advantage of being an owner except to have something to look at? 12Working people’s sleep is pleasant, whether they eat a little or a lot. But the full stomach of the rich doesn’t let them sleep.	 Eccl 5:8-12

13There’s a grievous problem I’ve seen under the sun: wealth hoarded to the hoarder’s hurt. 14When he lost that wealth in a bad venture and had fathered a son, he couldn’t support him. 15He came naked from his mother’s womb; he’ll go like he came. He won’t take anything with him from his labor. 16That’s a grievous thing: people die like they’re born; so what do they get out of working for the wind? 17Their whole life they eat in the dark, oppressed, sick, and angry.

18I’ve seen something that’s fitting and good: to eat, drink, and enjoy your work under the sun for the few years God gives you; that’s your reward. 19It’s also God’s gift to all he’s given wealth. He’s enabled them to eat from it, receive their reward, and enjoy what they do. 20They won’t dwell on how long they’re going to live, because God keeps them occupied with happiness.				Eccl 5:13-20

6:1There’s a common tragedy I’ve seen under the sun: 2people that God has given wealth and honor so they have everything they could want, but he hasn’t given them a chance to enjoy them; a foreigner is enjoying them. That’s a pointless tragedy. 3If a man fathers 100 children and lives for however many years, but isn’t satisfied with good things and doesn’t even get a proper burial, then I say,

“A miscarriage is better off 4because he would have come in pointless and gone out in the dark. 5A miscarriage never sees the sun or knows anything. 6Even if someone lives 1,000 years twice and isn’t content, what’s the point? Everybody ends up in the same place.”

7All our labor is for our mouth; yet our appetite isn’t satisfied. 8What advantage do the wise have over the foolish? What advantage do the poor have that know how to conduct themselves with other people? 9What the eyes see is better than what the soul wants. That’s pointless too, like chasing the wind.	 Eccl 6:1-9

10God has already decided what’s going to happen, including what each of us will be. We can’t argue with him about it; he’s stronger than we are. 11The more we say the less it means; so what’s the point of talking? 12Who knows what’s good for us anyway during the few years of our pointless life? They’ll go by like a shadow, and who can tell us what will happen under the sun when they’re done?  	Eccl 6:10-12

7:1A good reputation is better than expensive ointment;

the day you die is better than the day you’re born.

2It’s better to go to a house of mourning

than to a house of feasting;

because that’s the end of everyone,

and the living should take it to heart.

3Sorrow is better than laughter in this respect:

when the face is sad, the heart can be happy.

4The heart of the wise remembers there’s mourning,

but the heart of a fool just thinks about having fun.

5It’s better to listen to a rebuke from the wise

than be regaled by the songs of a fool.

6A fool’s laughter doesn’t last long;

it’s like thorns crackling under a heating pot:

it’s pointless.	Eccl 7:1-6

7Oppression can turn the wise into fools;

bribes corrupt their heart.

8Finishing is better than starting;

patience is better than pride.

9Don’t get mad quick,

because anger thrives in the chest of fools.

10Don’t say, “Why were the old days better than now?”

You don’t ask that because you’re wise.

11Wisdom plus inheritance is good;

it’s an advantage to those who see the sun.

12Protecting knowledge is like protecting money,

but only knowledge can save your life. 			Eccl 7:7-12

13Think about what God does;

who can straighten out what he bends?

14Be happy in prosperous times,

but in hard times think about this:

God has made the one as well as the other;

so you can’t be sure what will happen when you’re gone.

15I’ve seen all kinds of things in my pointless life,

including good people that die young and bad people that die old.

16Don’t overestimate your “goodness” or “wisdom.”

Why ruin what you really are?

17Don’t be excessively bad or foolish.

Why die early? 18Avoid extremes.

A humble person that respects God

ends up with both wise goodness and long life.

19One wise person is stronger than ten rulers in a city.

20Nobody’s always good; 21so don’t take too seriously everything you hear; you may hear your servant cursing you, 22and you know how often you’ve cursed people. 	    Eccl 7:13-22

23I determined I’d be wise about everything, but I couldn’t do it. 24No one can figure out what’s distant and deep. 25I set my mind to knowing, investigating, looking for wisdom and explanation, to identifying sinfulness, foolishness, and folly. 26I discovered more bitter than death is a woman whose heart is a snare, whose hands are chains.

27“Here’s something I’ve discovered,” the Preacher says, “combining one thing with another to reach a conclusion, 28something I’m still looking for and haven’t found. I’ve found a man among a thousand, but I haven’t found a woman among them. 29I’ve found only this: God made people godly, but they’ve sought out their own ways.”    	   Eccl 7:23-29

8:1Who is wise enough to figure out what things mean? Wisdom puts a glow on the face and changes a harsh countenance to a radiant one.

2My advice to you is to keep the king’s command that you’ve sworn before God to do. 3Don’t try to avoid your duty or put it off because it’s unpleasant. The king can do what he pleases 4because his word is final and you’re in no position to question it. 5The one that obeys his command won’t come to harm because the wise know how to do it and when. 6There’s a right time and proper way to do everything even in times of trouble. 7How can anybody avoid what nobody knows is going to happen? 8None of us can keep our spirit from leaving or prevent our death from coming. There’s no getting out of a war, and sin won’t let people off that practice it. 9I’ve seen all that and thought about what all people do under the sun to lord it over one another.         			   Eccl 8:1-9

10Then I saw the sinful buried who use to frequent the Holy Place. They were soon forgotten in the city where they did it. It’s pointless. 11The sentence against a sin doesn’t always come right away. That’s why people think they can get away with it. 12Though a sinner sins 100 times and keeps living, I still know it’ll be well with those who respect God openly. 13but it won’t be well for those sinners; they won’t lengthen their days like a shadow because they don’t respect God.

14Something else happens that’s pointless too: good people treated like they’re bad, and bad people treated like they’re good. 15So I recommend enjoying life, because there’s nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and enjoy life.

16When I applied my mind to knowing wisdom and seeing what happens in the world (even if a person never slept), 17I looked at everything God does and concluded that no one can figure out what’s going on under the sun no matter how hard they try. Though the wisest may claim to understand it, they haven’t figured it out. 	  Eccl 8:10-17

9:1I’ve concluded that good, wise people and what they do are in God’s hands, but they don’t know if love or hate lies around the corner. 2It’s the same for everyone. The good and the bad share the same fate whether they’re ceremonially clean or not, whether they offer sacrifices or not. Good people are treated like sinners; people that take oaths are treated like ones that are afraid to. 3It doesn’t seem right that there’s one destiny for everybody. Their hearts are perverted; their minds harbor insanity their whole life; afterward they go to the dead. 4Where there’s life there’s hope; it's better to be a live dog than a dead lion. 5The living do know they’ll die; the dead don’t know anything. They don’t have any future because they’re forgotten. 6Their love, their hate, their zeal perish with them; they won’t play a part in anything under the sun. Eccl 9:1-6

7So enjoy your bread and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, because God already approves of it. 8Wear good clothes and use plenty of oil on your head. 9Enjoy life with the wife you love all the fleeting days God gives you. That’s the reward in life for your toil under the sun. 10Whatever your hand finds to do, do it diligently; there’s no activity or planning or wisdom in Sheol where you’re going.

11Again, I saw that under the sun the swift don’t necessarily win the race, soldiers don’t win the battle, the wise don’t get the bread, the discerning aren’t wealthy, the capable don’t gain approval; time and chance interfere with everything. 12Besides, people don’t know what’s going to happen to them; they’re like fish in a seine or birds in a snare: they unexpectedly get caught by misfortune.

13I’ve also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me. 14There was a small city where few people lived. A powerful king came, surrounded it, and built big siege works against it. 15But a poor man in the city delivered it by his wisdom; yet nobody remembered that poor wise man. 	Eccl 9:7-15

16So I said, “Wisdom is better than power.”

People often look down on poor people’s wisdom

and ignore what they say.

17The words of the wise heard in quietness

are better than the shouts of a ruler among fools.

18Wisdom is better than weapons,

but one sinner can destroy lots of good. 	Eccl 9:16-18

10:1Dead flies even make perfume stink;

likewise, a little foolishness can spoil wisdom and honor.

2A foolish heart pulls to the left;

a wise one pulls to the right.

3You can recognize fools

just by the way they walk.

4If a ruler’s anger flares at you, don’t react,

because composure smooths over big offenses.	Eccl 10:1-4

5There’s a problem I’ve seen under the sun, an error that originates in rulers 6who appoint foolish people to high positions while putting successful people in lower ones. 7I’ve seen slaves ride horses beside princes that walk on the ground like slaves.

8If you dig a pit, you may fall in it;

if you break through a wall, you may get bit by a snake.

9If you quarry stones, you may be injured by them;

if you split logs, you may hurt yourself doing it.

10If you don’t sharpen your axe,

you have to work harder;

wisdom aids success.	Eccl 10:5-10

11If a snake bites before it’s charmed,

the charmer hasn’t accomplished anything.

12Words from the wise are gracious;

the thoughts of fools destroy them.

13They begin with foolish talk,

and foolish talk leads to foolish deeds;

14but fools just keep talking.

Nobody knows what’s going to happen;

who can tell people what will come after them?

15Fools’ toil wears them out so much

they can’t find their way home.

16Misfortune awaits the land whose king is a kid,

whose princes feast in the morning.

17You’re a fortunate land if its king is noble

and its princes eat at normal times—

for energy, not for gluttony. 				Eccl 10:11-17

18Through laziness, rafters sag;

through idleness, the roof leaks.

19People fix a meal for enjoyment;

wine makes life happy;

money solves everything;

20Don’t curse the king in your bedroom

or the rich where you sleep.

A bird in the sky may hear what you say

and spread it around.	Eccl 10:18-20

11:1Toss your bread on the water;

it’ll come back around a long time later.

2Diversify your investments seven or eight ways;

you don’t know what risks lie ahead.

3Heavy clouds drop rain;

a tree stays where it falls.

4If you keep worrying about the weather, you won’t sow;

if you keep watching the clouds, you won’t reap.

5Just like you don’t know where the wind will blow

or how bones form in a womb,

you don’t understand what God’s doing

who makes everything happen.

6Plant your seed in the morning;

don’t be idle in the afternoon;

you don’t know if planting in the morning

or afternoon is best,

or if one’s as good as the other.	Eccl 11:1-6

7Light is pleasing;

sunrise is pleasant to behold.

8If you live a long time, enjoy all your years;

just remember, there’ll be lots of dark days,

and nothing will seem important in the end.

9Young people, enjoy life while you’re young;

stay pleasant.

Go ahead and follow your impulses and desires;

just remember, God will judge you for all of them.

10So don’t worry; take care of your health,

because childhood and the prime of life soon pass. 	Eccl 11:7-10

12:1Remember your Creator when you’re young,

before the difficult days come,

before the years close in and you say,

“I don’t enjoy them anymore”;

2before the sun, moon, and stars grow faint

and clouds remain after rain;

3when the watchmen [arms and hands?] of the house [body] are palsied

and strong men [shoulders?] hunch over;

when grinders [teeth?] stand idle because they’re few

and those looking out of windows [eyes?] can’t see much;

4when the doors to the street [lips?] are shut

and the sound of grinding [chewing?] is muffled,

when you arise at the time of a bird’s chirping

and young women sing faintly; 			Eccl 12:1-4

5when you’re afraid of falling*

and scared to walk around;

when your hair turns white like almond-tree blossoms

and the grasshopper drags itself along;

when your appetite’s gone*

and you go to your eternal home

while wailers walk the streets;

6before the silver cord snaps,

the golden bowl breaks,

the pitcher by the well shatters,

the pulley at the cistern doesn’t work anymore;

7when the dust returns to the earth where it was

and the spirit returns to the God who gave it.

8“Completely pointless,” the Preacher says; “it’s all pointless.”

Eccl 12:5-8

9Besides being a wise man, the Preacher taught the people. He weighed, studied, and classified lots of proverbs. 10He endeavored to write true things and searched for expressive words.

11The words of the wise are like goads. Collections of them are like nails tightly driven; they come from one Shepherd. 12My child, beware of anything more: there’s no end to writing books, and too much study wears you out.

13You’ve heard every view. Here’s the conclusion: respect God and do his will; that’s your role. 14God will judge every act, everything secret, good or bad.     	   Eccl 12:9-13
