PECULIARITIES OF LUKE

1.	Indicates most noticeably the prayer life of Jesus

2.  	More attention given to women involved in the life and ministry of Jesus, which could fit

with writing from Mary’s viewpoint

3.  	The infancy narrative and some other materials are written from Mary’s viewpoint.

4.  	Contains a section of “new material” in 10:1-18:14

5. 	Speaks of two angels rather than one:  Luke 24:4 ( = Matthew 28:2; Mark 16:5)

6. 	Emphasizes the humanity of Jesus—his corporeality

7.	Interest in the common man, the poor

8.	Calls “Simon the Cananaean” by the name “Judas (son) of James” (cp. Acts 1:13)

9.	Has a greater emphasis on the work of the Spirit

10.	Rarely uses the historic present (note 16:7)

11.	Luke-Acts alone uses the “filling” imagery for the Holy Spirit except for the one case in

Ephesians 4:18.

12.	Frequency of the ἐν τῷ (en tōi) + infinitive construction is much greater in Luke’s writings than elsewhere. It occurs 35 times in the gospel and 9 times in The Acts, but only 11 times in the rest of the New Testament (total 55).

13.	Τὸ γένος [to genos] for “the event,” “the thing that happened”: 23:47, 48; 24:12 (18); cp.

Acts 5:7; 13:12

14.	Except for Matthew 12:41, Luke-Acts is the only material that contains the double-noun

expression “men _____”:  Luke 7:37  (sinner woman?); 11:32; 17:12;  24:19;  Acts 1:16;

2:22, 29, 37; 3:12, 14; 5:35; 7:2; 8:27; 11:20; 13:6, 15, 16, 26, 38; 15:7, 13; 16:9; 17:22;

21:28; 22:1; 23:1, 6; 28:17

15.	Only gospel with a formal introduction: 1:1-4
