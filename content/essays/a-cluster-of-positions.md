A CLUSTER OF POSITIONS

1.	(Un)conscious desire to avoid the demand made on a person’s life if these materials are

true

2.	Anti-supernatural bias (note distinctions between atheistic, agnostic, deistic, neo-

orthodox)

The deistic impulse of a Newtonian universe shows itself in theological liberalism (the “older modernism”) that is akin to ancient Sadduceeism. This impulse correlates with (a) the stress on “scientific” method, taken to mean something that eliminates anything supernatural. There is a confusion between what a method can address and the idea that only those things exist which that method can address. The deistic impulse tries to foster an aura of philosophical legitimacy by claiming that (b) miracle would be a contradiction of natural law. The claim confuses contrary and contradictory, and different from opposite.

3.	The idea of the evolutionary origin of the Christian religion

4.	The pastoral epistles are not Pauline because they reflect a more developed, crystallized

form of doctrine and organization.

5.	Paul was not released from the Roman imprisonment. The writing of the pastorals cannot plausibly be made to fit with Paul’s life prior to Acts 28.

6.	Argument against the Roman imprisonment for prison epistles because they anticipate

his release

7.	A strong championing of an Ephesian imprisonment as the place for writing the prison

epistles

Believers must be careful about theories that originate among liberal theologians. Their theories may arise from matters opposed to a believer’s position.
