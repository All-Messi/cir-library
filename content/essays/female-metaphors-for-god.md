<strong>Hosea 11:3-4 God described as a mother</strong>

God: <em>“Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I who took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love. I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them.”</em>

<strong>Deuteronomy 32:18 God who gives birth</strong>

<em>“You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.”</em>

<strong>Isaiah 66:13 God as a comforting mother</strong>

God: <em>“As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.”</em>

<strong>Isaiah 49:15 God compared to a nursing mother</strong>

<strong>Isaiah 42:14 God as a woman in labor</strong>

God: <em>“For a long time I have held my peace, I have kept myself still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor, I will gasp and pant.”</em>

<strong>Psalm 131:2 God as a Mother</strong>

<strong>Psalm 123:2-3 God compared to a woman</strong>

“<em>As the eyes of a servant looks to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to you, YHWH, until you show us your mercy!”</em>

<strong>Matthew 23:37 and Luke 13:34 God as a Mother Hen</strong>

Jesus: <em>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!”</em>

<strong>Luke 15:8-10 God as a woman looking for her lost coin</strong>

Jesus: <em>“Or what woman having ten silver coins, is she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ Just so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</em>
