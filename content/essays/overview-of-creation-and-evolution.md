I.	Preliminary Definitions and Concepts


A.	God: label for ultimate reality


B.	God’s relationship to the universe


1.	Natural imminence: God is not distinct in kind from the universe.





*2.	Natural transcendence: God is distinct from the universe. Overlapping in immanence has to do with availability; overlapping in kind has to do with personal creation.










C.	Change


1.  	Modification: change without increasing the number of factors.

*2.	Complexification: change with increasing the number of actors.


D.	Causation


1.	Natural cause: an effect produced by a cause inside nature.

*2.	Miracle: an effect produced by a cause outside of nature, above nature,						supernatural; not just a different way, but different kind of way.


E.	Creationism: complexification via factor(s) external to the natural realm.

F.	Evolution: complexification via factor(s) internal to the natural realm.


1.	Micro-evolution: demonstrable change in matters of degree

*2.	Macro-evolution: extrapolated change into matters of kind.


II.	Models of Creation


Creation involves transcendent deity that, among other acts, brings mass/energy into existence from nothing (Hebrew<strong> 11</strong>:3) and complexifies by miracle irrespective of time rate. The natural order has a finite beginning and possesses order because of the common Mind that lies behind the origin of “parts” whether created directly from nothing (fiat) or using previously existing created mass/energy (progressive).


A. 	Short-term creationism


1.  	Type A: creation from nothing to final form in a week’s span; earth's age is in the order of 10,000 to 30,000 years.

2.	Type B: same as Type A except that the creative process occurred in unspecified length of time; the earth’s age is longer in varying degrees according to the theorist’s construction. The antiquity of humankind extends back to some degree, but the antiquity of non-human origins is indefinite.


B.	Long-term creationism


3.	Ruin-reconstruction: the present form of the earth is one of several destructions followed by new beginnings of divine creativity.

4.	Progressive Creationism Type A: polyphyletic

5.	Progressive Creationism Type B: monophyletic


III. Models of Evolution


Evolution is endogenous complexification over time by laws operating without beginning or end.


A.	Relative to God


1.	Theistic evolution: transcendent deity is only involved in the creation from nothing and by building into the natural order the potentials for nature’s complexifying itself.

2.	Atheistic evolution: mass/energy is eternal and self-complexifying. (If the view of God is not that of transcendent deity, then atheistic is the same as theistic (pantheism), but no external causation is involved; hence, it is not called “creation” even if something new comes about naturally.



B.	As to pattern: assorted terms


1.	Emergent evolution

2.	Punctuated equilibrium

3.	Vitalism


The creation-evolution controversy is important to Christians because evolution is an alternative, non-theistic explanation of cosmogony and cosmology, which if successful eliminates any need for a supernatural explanation of life. Furthermore, it reduces life to a materialistic base with implicit meaninglessness because of lacking purpose. Evolution is yet one more example of humans’ needless departure from a knowledge of the truth about God, nature, and humankind (Romans <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>).
