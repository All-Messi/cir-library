PLACE OF ACTS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT

Basic proposition: Place leads to purpose.

I. Traces the spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome

Note  Acts 1:8 pattern:             	Jerusalem

Judaea

Samaria

Ends of the earth (Rome)

(HISTORICAL)     		Provides a framework for Paul’s epistles

II. Covers the intercalary period between the beginning of the church and the end of

Israel (middle third of the first century)

Covers to within three years of the time when

the Roman armies began (in 66) working their

way up from the coast to Jerusalem

(APOLOGETIC)	           	Note  the  gist  of  Gamaliel’s  speech  (Acts 5).

The purpose  of this period  was to  show  that

Jesus  Messiah  was  not  leading  just  another

fly-by-night Messianic movement.

III. Carries out the work of the Spirit in the initial spread of the church

(THEOLOGICAL)              	Note the number of incidents in which the Holy

Spirit plays a prominent part.

IV. Connects the ministry of Jesus (gospels) with the meaning of Jesus (epistles)

V. Provides a historical framework for conceivably all the other New Testament writings

if we should espouse the idea that all the New Testament books were written before

the destruction of Jerusalem (John A. T. Robertson).
