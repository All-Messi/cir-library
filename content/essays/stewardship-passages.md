The texts used as bases for encouragement to giving should not include the tithing texts that are so frequently read. Tithing was the “income tax” for the national setting of first covenant, a covenant we are no longer under. Using Old Testament tithing bases for giving ends up comparing oranges and apples. There is no legitimacy to the whole issue of comparing amounts Jews were to give with amounts Christians should give. The “increase” lies not particularly in amounts from first to second covenant (a quantitative matter), but in the motivational and attitudinal dimension (a qualitative matter).

The are many texts in scripture that can be useful settings from which to make observations that apply to monetary support of the kingdom of God–matters like our total dependence on God, our having only what he has given us in the first place, the use of material things to divine purposes, the service mentality before God, and the like. Consequently, a person does not have to use only those passages that talk about money when he encourages fellow Christians in regard to their use of money for kingdom purposes.
