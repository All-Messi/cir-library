STUDY GUIDE ON THE SANCTIFICATION PROCESS

The following analysis of a Christian’s growth process produces a schematic based on the inner-outer differential. By inner we mean the understanding, emotions, and motives we have; outer means the actions we do. Each group of scriptures given below affirms something about the inner, the outer, or their relationship. Determine what that fact is and why it is important. Then synthesize all the parts into a working model of the growth process with observations on its implications for witnessing and applications to Christian education and defense of the faith.

11:37-44; John 7:24; Hebrews 4:12-13; 2 Peter 2:17—springs that give no water;

Jude 12— no fruit)
