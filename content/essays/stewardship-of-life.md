INTRODUCTION


The stewardship of life sees the whole of life as having a primarily vertical direction. It envisions, not a consumer mentality, but a producer mentality. A person must start at the right place in order to think, feel, and act properly in this stewardship.



I. SELF


Our possessions are not ours; they belong to the creator: Psalm<strong> 24</strong>:1.

Our privileges: 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:7

Our selves: we do not belong to ourselves: Psalm <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:1.


God’s by creation

People’s responsibility for the earth by God’s appointment: Psalm<strong> 8</strong>:3-6.

God’s by redemption: 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:19b-20a


A person plus his accouterments equals the total self.


<em>“First They Gave of Themselves to the Lord”</em>: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:5



II. TIME


Adult capacity for deriving satisfaction from work (vs. entertainment or play)


III. ABILITIES


A.	Natural capacities			talents	A)	THE INDIVIDUAL

Talents   and   skills

Christians.

work and require the

prophecy

speaking in languages


Practically any skill or capacity we have can be applied to the work of the kingdom.

Giving of our abilities, and the like, may be more valuable and give greater satisfaction

than giving resources (money, goods), but we can look at giving money too.



IV. RESOURCES


A.	Motivations


1.	Example


Jerusalem Christians

Philippian church      (Philippians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:14-19; 2 Corinthians<strong> 8</strong>)

Widow’s mite            (Mark <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:42)

Christ himself            (2 Corinthians<strong> 8</strong>:9)


2.	Gratitude


1 Corinthians <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:55-58 + <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:1a: Redemption is connected with collection.

Why didn’t God give the Law after the exodus?

Ephesians<strong> 1</strong>:6: <em>“To the praise of the glory of his grace”</em>

Matthew <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:6: <em>“You received freely; give freely.”</em>


3.	Love: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:7-8

4.	Results


We help change ourselves (Ephesians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:28).

Our affections are tied to the matter to which we contributed (Matthew

<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:21).

Sense of satisfaction

Blessing that returns to us (Acts <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:35)

Makes people happy (ministers’ support) and God too (Philippians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:18)

Good that is accomplished


God is praised by our actions.

by the gratitude to him from those dependent on our

liberality (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:12-13).


As to amount, the more we put into something, the more we get out of it and the more our hearts are tied to it (Matthew<strong> 6</strong>:21; 2 Corinthians<strong> 9</strong>:6).


B.	Amount


Not all people are alike in circumstances of life,

resources,

level of faith.


1.	According to the level of faith (Romans <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:3-8); we need to be careful pushing people to give beyond the level of their commitment.

2.	According to need (Acts<strong> 4</strong>:35; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:45)

3.	According to ability (Acts<strong> 11</strong>:29; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:3, 11-12; 1 Corinthians

<strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:1)

4.	According to what creates equality (2 Corinthians<strong> 8</strong>:13-15; cp. John the Baptist in Luke<strong> 3</strong>:11)


C.	Manner


Intentionally:	Ephesians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:28

Voluntarily:		2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:3    	(newborn baby—life in itself)

Cheerfully:		2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:7	(from the best) (give of self)

(purposed/planned)

Regularly:		2 Corinthians<strong> 16</strong>:1  	Do not get caught by surprise when not

able to do much.



CONCLUSION


The interpersonal context removes weaknesses that come from depersonalizing stewardship      like . . .


giving in order to get

quantified approach to giving


Giving of ourselves (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:5)


to meet the needs of real people (Philippians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:10-20)
