STEWARDSHIP OF LIFE

INTRODUCTION

The stewardship of life sees the whole of life as having a primarily vertical direction. It envisions, not a consumer mentality, but a producer mentality. A person must start at the right place in order to think, feel, and act properly in this stewardship.

I. SELF

Our possessions are not ours; they belong to the creator: Psalm 24:1.

Our privileges: 1 Corinthians 4:7

Our selves: we do not belong to ourselves: Psalm 24:1.

God’s by creation

People’s responsibility for the earth by God’s appointment: Psalm 8:3-6.

God’s by redemption: 1 Corinthians 6:19b-20a

A person plus his accouterments equals the total self.

“First They Gave of Themselves to the Lord”: 2 Corinthians 8:5

II. TIME

Adult capacity for deriving satisfaction from work (vs. entertainment or play)

III. ABILITIES

A.	Natural capacities			talents	A)	THE INDIVIDUAL

Talents   and   skills

intelligence					Spirit we become

Christians.

work and require the

1 Corinthians 12			                                	 	most attention.

prophecy

speaking in languages

Practically any skill or capacity we have can be applied to the work of the kingdom.

Giving of our abilities, and the like, may be more valuable and give greater satisfaction

than giving resources (money, goods), but we can look at giving money too.

IV. RESOURCES

A.	Motivations

1.	Example

Jerusalem Christians

Philippian church      (Philippians 4:14-19; 2 Corinthians 8)

Widow’s mite            (Mark 12:42)

Christ himself            (2 Corinthians 8:9)

2.	Gratitude

1 Corinthians 15:55-58 + 16:1a: Redemption is connected with collection.

Why didn’t God give the Law after the exodus?

Ephesians 1:6: “To the praise of the glory of his grace”

Matthew 10:6: “You received freely; give freely.”

3.	Love: 2 Corinthians 8:7-8

4.	Results

We help change ourselves (Ephesians 4:28).

Our affections are tied to the matter to which we contributed (Matthew

6:21).

Sense of satisfaction

Blessing that returns to us (Acts 20:35)

Makes people happy (ministers’ support) and God too (Philippians 4:18)

Good that is accomplished

God is praised by our actions.

by the gratitude to him from those dependent on our

liberality (2 Corinthians 9:12-13).

As to amount, the more we put into something, the more we get out of it and the more our hearts are tied to it (Matthew 6:21; 2 Corinthians 9:6).

B.	Amount

Not all people are alike in circumstances of life,

resources,

level of faith.

1.	According to the level of faith (Romans 12:3-8); we need to be careful pushing people to give beyond the level of their commitment.

2.	According to need (Acts 4:35; 2:45)

3.	According to ability (Acts 11:29; 2 Corinthians 8:3, 11-12; 1 Corinthians

16:1)

4.	According to what creates equality (2 Corinthians 8:13-15; cp. John the Baptist in Luke 3:11)

C.	Manner

Intentionally:	Ephesians 4:28

Voluntarily:		2 Corinthians 8:3    	(newborn baby—life in itself)

Cheerfully:		2 Corinthians 9:7	(from the best) (give of self)

(purposed/planned)

Regularly:		2 Corinthians 16:1  	Do not get caught by surprise when not

able to do much.

CONCLUSION

The interpersonal context removes weaknesses that come from depersonalizing stewardship      like . . .

giving in order to get

quantified approach to giving

Giving of ourselves (2 Corinthians 8:5)

to meet the needs of real people (Philippians 4:10-20)

because Christ has done so much for us
