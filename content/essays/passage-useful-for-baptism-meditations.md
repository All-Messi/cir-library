Texts that describe John’s baptism or give accounts of Johannine baptism are not particularly appropriate for Christian baptisms. The meaning of the two baptisms is different as illustrated by the baptizing in the name of Christ those disciples of John Paul found in Ephesus (Acts 19:1-7). Reading the account of Jesus’ own baptism would not be natural for this same reason.

Preparation for Baptisms



A number of profitable activities can be done by the rest of the body while preparations are being made for baptism.


1.	texts of scripture that deal with baptism and related topics

2.	songs sung by the congregation. The songs useful here deal with the same set of topics that are covered by scripture passages as noted above. It may be possible to correlate the topic if the meditation leaders knows far enough in advance to work out those correlations. A song may be sung in response to the baptism instead of, or in addition to, a song prior to the baptism. “Now I Belong to Jesus,”<em> etc</em>., are typically used in this way.

3.	responsive readings

4.	prayers
