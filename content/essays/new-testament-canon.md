NEW TESTAMENT CANON

The canonical books of the New Testament consist of those that were written by close acquaintances of Christ who witnessed his resurrection (apostolicity), those that were accepted across the whole church (catholicity), and those that represent a consistent viewpoint on teaching and practice (doctrinal harmony). They contrast with books written later, books of unknown origin, books accepted in small areas of the Roman empire, and those with doctrines of faith and practice that diverge widely from the canonical books.
