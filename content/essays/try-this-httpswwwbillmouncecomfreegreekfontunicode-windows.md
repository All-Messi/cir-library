I didn't find the files I had before, but this is pretty good.

Once you get it installed, you should be able to find and print a keyboard map.

Otherwise you can make your own, for the accent marks, etc. Some are combinations using ctrl or alt.

I have used aftermarket keyboard programs before, some I thought were more intuitive than windows, but when a new version of windows comes out, they become obsolete.

The windows keys can be intuitive, once you figure out their system.

The windows keyboard uses Unicode, which is a true Greek font. There is a code for every character, including for example, alpha smooth breathing and circumflex. There are some older programs that were easy to use, but the computer didn't really see them as Greek letters. They saw them as [a / ^] or something like that. Unicode is best. It is always Greek. You can use it online, in emails, whatever. You can alphabetize and search texts.

ΜΗΝΙΝ ΑΙΗΔΕ ΎΕΑ. α.α α

I haven't typed Greek for a while. So I don't remember how to do all the accents, etc. I do remember y is upsilon, q is maybe theta.

Let me know how the notes from Mounce work.

The following is a list of key combinations to type in Unicode Greek using an English keyboard. It might differ between different keyboards. ά type ;a ὰ type ]a ᾶ type [a ἀ type ‘a ἁ type “a ἄ type /a ἅ type ?a ἂ type \a ἃ type |a ἆ type =a ἇ type +a ᾳ type {a ᾀ type {ctrl} {alt} ;a ᾲ type {ctrl} {alt} ]a ᾷ type {ctrl} {alt} [a

You might print out the above key . Note that you type the special character before the Greek letter. You can use this after the Windows Greek Keyboard is selected.

The key is from the above. I think that is Mounce's site. He recommends installing an aftermarket converter, but as I said above, they become obsolete after a while, so I just learned to use the windows overstrikes.
