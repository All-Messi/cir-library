Introduction


In women’s studies, something is causing equally committed, intelligent, educated, hard-working, well-known Christians to come to incompatible conclusions, which leads to disagreement and division. Since this topic has behavioral correlates, we cannot treat it as we do the millennial question and go on about our work; this topic affects how we go on with our work. Since it is a broad-to-narrow issue, people with different persuasions find it hard to be equally tolerant; it is usually easier for a broader view to be accepting of a more restricted one than <em>vice versa</em>.

This topic centers on interpretation procedure (hermeneutics).

misinformation, biblical and otherwise

concept inventory, holes in our set of ideas

presuppositions

faulty thinking patterns—logic (formal and informal fallacies)

predetermined conclusions we work toward

Impact of personality on interpretation

What feels true we expect to find the Bible saying because we believe is

telling the truth.

Experience: mothers, wives, daughters, friends, our own personal bent

The subjective “prison”: all discussions about sex roles are carried on by males or females. All clinical research is carried on by men or women.

Sexual subjectivity is difficult to escape because it is such an intimate and all-pervasive aspect of human persons. It lies closer to the center of our sense of “identity” than any other one thing. That fact fits with one reason God created sexuality and marriage into the human personal order—to provide us a tangible arena that forces us to develop self-transcendence
