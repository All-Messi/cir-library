<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              We do not need to decide
between the “theories of inspiration” to understand how scripture came to have
the character of “God-breathedness” (2 Timothy <b>3</b>:16). As we can judge
from scripture itself, God operated in more than one way in producing scripture.
The models of origin may be organized according to what God specially gave to
his human spokesmen.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              1. God gave the <u>words</u>.
Probably no one holds the dictation theory of inspiration strictly understood,
even though people often suppose that Christians have that explanation for the
origin of the Bible. It might apply to a few cases, notably the Ten Commandments,
which in the first copy were written by the finger of God (Exodus <b>31</b>:18;
cp. also Daniel <b>5</b>:25-28). In this format God operates in a significantly
positive fashion (Daniel <b>5</b>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              2. God gave the <u>ideas</u>.
God revealed the concepts to the prophet through a variety of means. He may
have <u>implanted</u> the ideas directly in the mind, but more normally we
suppose that he <u>told</u> them as he did to Moses at the burning bush and
elsewhere in Exodus when Moses entered the Tabernacle. When it came time for
his spokesman to speak or write, the Spirit of God could prevent him from error
in expressing what he had received. Though not dictating the words, God could
operate restrictively to keep the prophet from erroneously expressing the ideas.
In this way, we can speak of the “verbal inspiration” of the text. The Spirit
acted positively in revelation and preventively in proclamation and inscripturation. 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              3. God gave the <u>abilities</u>.
In this “dynamic inspiration,” the Spirit heightened the perception of the
prophet rather than giving the words or ideas. Of course, heightened ability
could also accompany ideas God may have revealed. The truthfulness of the
prophet’s reproduction depended not only on being prevented from misexpression,
but also on proper perception and recollection. Something of this sort seems
apparent in John <b>14</b>:26, when Jesus promised <u>the disciples</u> that
the Holy Spirit would bring to their remembrance everything he had taught them.
In this case as well, the content and verbal form of the record could be
completely reliable so as to describe appropriately God’s own exhaled message. The
Spirit acted positively in providing added abilities and preventively in
helping to avoid error during the free exercise of those abilities. <u>Solomon</u>
serves as a ready example of a man who was given special wisdom to lead God’s
great people (1 Kings<b> 3</b>:4-15). His writings would express that
inspiration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              4. God gave the <u>experiences</u>.
From the experiences God caused or allowed, the prophet generated the content
itself. The conversion of Cornelius illustrates this model. God gave Peter
experiences (the vision, the command to accompany the Gentiles, <i>etc</i>.) in
connection with which the apostle inferred one of the more significant
doctrines in the New Testament. The text says he “perceived” (Acts <b>10</b>:34-35)
that Gentiles as such were acceptable to God. Several theological ramifications
issue from this central point: Christianity was not a continuation within
Judaism. Christianity did not represent a political, but a spiritual system,
and so forth. From the way the record reads, we infer that God did not
verbalize that precise point to the apostle. Peter himself generated the
content, but through the Spirit’s preventive role the spoken (or written)
product possessed verbal and conceptual correctness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              5. God gave the <u>office</u>.
This model provides the most unstructured format from which verbal inspiration,
infallibility, inerrancy of the message can derive. The prophet generates the
concepts on the basis of his calling as a prophet and his understanding of
God’s intentions through him. <u>Nathan</u> the prophet and David the king
illustrate the construct. At first, Nathan confirmed David’s desire to erect a
temple in Jerusalem: <i>“Go, do everything that’s in your heart; Yahveh is with
you”</i> (2 Samuel <b>7</b>:3). That night, however, Yahveh corrected the
prophet without censure, telling him to return to David with the message that
David’s seed would build the temple (2 Samuel <b>7</b>:4-17). Nathan evidently
supposed that, on the basis of his divine call to be prophet, those ideas that
came to his sanctified mind accorded with the Lord’s will unless he stood
corrected, which he did in this case. Since Nathan was serving as advisor to
the king, his verdict here may represent advice more than commandment. At any
rate, the message in its final form was accurate.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              <u>Paul</u> apparently
does a similar thing in 1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:8-9, 12ff, 25ff, 40, where he
gives “inspired advice” rather than express commandment. Some practical
problems may be handled in more than one way. Specifying one way is accurate
even though another option might be acceptable, especially for a different kind
of situation elsewhere at a different time. Neither Nathan nor Paul “spoke
presumptuously” (Deuteronomy <b>18</b>:20) even though one of them stood
corrected in one instance we know about. Under the Spirit’s preventive work,
such pronouncements still possess the quality we call inspiration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Verbal inspiration can
result in more than one way. The formats described here appear in descending
order according to the degree of special <u>divine direction</u> and in
ascending order according to the degree of <u>human initiative</u>. God’s
positive role diminishes, and his protective role increases as the human
element increases. The positive role of the Spirit means what the Spirit
initiates. The protective role means what man initiates and the Spirit ratifies
or corrects. His correcting, protective, restrictive, preventive, permissive
role applies both to words and content. Most cases appear to involve a
combination of the five models and, therefore, of the positive and protective
modes within them. One model need not fit all. But under both modes and any
proportioning of them, the result is complete reliability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Describing these five
formats (a) clarifies how we can talk about totally accurate scripture without espousing
dictation theory for originating it. Being aware of other models besides
dictation (b) accounts nicely for the variety of structure, style, and content
present in biblical writings. It fits with the fact that accuracy applies to
the <u>intended meaning</u> rather than to <u>forms of expression</u>. It
allows human creativity to express itself in divine service. Having additional
formats in mind also (c) affirms the dignity of the human authors as persons. It
sees the writing of scripture as an interpersonal process instead of a
mechanical one. It removes the idea that producing an errorless text would
prostitute the writers’ humanness. Conceptualizing a variety of formats (d)
avoids overkill. We can apply to inscripturation the principle that God does
not do for people what they can do for themselves.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Articulating a plurality
of models (e) gives substance to the statement that “God-breathedness” (2
Timothy <b>3</b>:16) specifies more the <u>nature of the result</u> (scripture)
than the precise <u>manner of the cause</u> (inscripturation). Viewing the
Bible as accurate in all matters whereof it speaks does not require any particular
“theory of inspiration.” To say, for comparison’s sake, that God drove out the
seven nations of Canaan does not require any format for his driving them out. The
statement does not remove human effort by Israelite soldiers in conquering the
land. It does mean at least that God guaranteed outcomes by making up for
whatever the Israelites may have lacked in their ability to overthrow these
nations on their own. Exodus <b>23</b>:30-31 says, <i>“. . . I will drive them
out before you . . . you shall drive them out before you.”</i> God guarantees
what his special servants do. God is said to do what he only makes a decisive
contribution to. God is even said to do what he allows (Job <b>1-2</b>; cp. <b>42</b>:11),
including evil (Revelation <b>17</b>:17). Understanding the point behind the
expression “God-breathedness” needs to allow the biblical use of language to
have the flexibility that the Bible uses.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Scripture has the
character of what God himself would have expressed directly (“exhaled,” or
breathed out). Understanding that expression requires only that God intervene
to correct what human error might introduce. Otherwise, authors have free exercise
of their creative powers. The concept does not remove human effort in producing
the content; it only guarantees accuracy by making up for whatever the authors
may have lacked in themselves. God’s correction could come in several ways,
such as the one he used when Nathan misdirected David. Yahveh operated there in
a largely preventive sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              (f) Finally, in these five
models there is always a supernatural element, which is what distinguishes
special divine spokesmen from normal ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Our comments here do not
argue for any specific view of scripture, and they are not calculated to do so.
Rather, they describe processes applicable to more than one view.  That variety
of models applies to even the strictest concept of inspiration. Keeping them in
mind removes distracting ideas that come up in discussions on the nature of
scripture.          </span></p>
