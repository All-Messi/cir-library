<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Scripture
alone</u> (<i>sola scriptura</i>) means using the Bible as the sole authority
for Christian belief and practice. It sets aside other normative sources for
the Christian faith: creeds, tradition, apocryphal works, ecclesiastical
pronouncements, additional primary literature beyond the sixty-six books of the
canon, and persons claiming inner light and special revelation. The fundamental
issue is not doctrinal error as much as practical authority. Going beyond the
apostolic witness does open up the possibility—even likelihood—of false doctrine;
but even if it did not, these other sources are disregarded. Other writings may
have devotional value and helpful insight, but they do not determine what
Christians are to believe and practice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Creeds</u>
attempt to summarize Christian teaching. The early creeds sought to establish
minimum doctrinal requirements for orthodoxy among Christians. That goal can imply
that the rest of biblical content is negotiable or irrelevant. Beyond that,
without realizing it, they can stray off into unrevealed matters and unnecessary
viewpoints derived from tacit assumptions rather from biblical teaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Fourteen
books, written during the time between Malachi and Christ, comprise the <u>Apocrypha</u>.
Because they came from a time when <i>“there was no exact succession of
prophets,” </i>they have at most a historical and devotional value. Similar
secondary writings grew up after the close of the apostolic age, most of them
motivated by a desire to advocate various false teachings based on Gnostic
philosophy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Tradition</u>
refers to prominent ideas that grew up over the centuries about items scripture
does not address. They may be interesting and may offer historical information
of varying likelihood, but they are not required for Christian understanding,
and they are often unwholesome ideas rooted ultimately in Greek dualism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Extra-canonical
normative literature</u> is a defining characteristic for what is labeled a
“sect.” Writings of that sort attempt to offer special interpretation of
Scripture or claim additional truth beyond the New Testament as the New
Covenant superseded the Old. In Christ, however, his followers have God’s final
revelation; nothing needs to supplement or replace it with something “better.”
The Christian faith is something once and for all time delivered to the saints
(Jude 3).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>By-laws</u>
differ from creeds in that they deal with a congregation’s operation: who does
what, how procedural decisions are made, and the like. They specify how the
church operates in regard to non-doctrinal matters where variation does not conflict
with New Testament teaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Statements
of faith</u> are sometimes prepared to indicate where a congregation or
institution stands on certain doctrinal matters without meaning to imply that
these contents set norms for fellowship or orthodoxy for Christians generally. Such
outlines may be used internally for choosing leadership, but they are not considered
authoritative for the faith, only for what the faithful here believe they
should stand for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            From time to
time, people arise from within the body of Christ, claiming to have received <u>special
revelation</u> about the future or been given <u>special guidance</u> on what
to do. Though conceivable in principle, such claims are suspect. Unless <u>such
people themselves</u> can distinguish their own thoughts and the Spirit’s
communication, they should not “speak presumptuously” in the Lord’s name lest they
incur greater condemnation. Unless <u>those persons’ hearers</u> have some indisputable
basis for authenticating them, they should set those claims aside, because the
word of God already received is sufficient for all good works (2 Timothy <b>3</b>:16-17).</span></p>
