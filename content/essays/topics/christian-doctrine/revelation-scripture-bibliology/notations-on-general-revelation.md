<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>General revelation</u> refers to
natural experiences in the natural universe. <u>Special revelation</u> refers
to what comes through visible divine intervention into the natural. The former
deals with <u>nature</u>, natural processes, natural events, and can include
social processes, human history, subjective experience. The latter deals with <u>supernatural
intervention</u> that a person can recognize as supernatural because it does
not occur naturally. <i>Intervention</i> labels what God causes beyond </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>what natural process produces</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. It refers to supernatural occurrences and their
meaning given through special revelation. For us, special revelation centers on
the revelation preserved in scripture. General revelation comes through the
aspects of reality that <u>science</u> studies. Special revelation comes
through <u>scripture</u> and involves inspiration. General revelation serves as
the basis of <u>philosophy</u>, which uses reason to “discover” truth from
experience. Special revelation is the basis for <u>theology</u>, which uses
reason to “understand” truth in light of experience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            General revelation differs from special
revelation in the way it comes—through natural rather than supernatural operations.
General contrasts with special rather than with specific, even though general
revelation is less precise in what it can make known. It is called “general”
because it occurs everywhere at all times whereas special revelation occurs to
special people at special times and places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Intervention</u> means supernaturally
coming into the natural. Some intervention is <u>visible intervention</u> that conveys
<u>special revelation</u>. The part of special revelation that is available to
us is in the <u>Bible</u>. (Not every special revelation has been written, and
some inspired writings may no longer exist.) For all practical purposes,
special revelation is the Bible, as far as we are concerned—though some people do
believe in continued revelation either to the church or to individuals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. Values of General Revelation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  <u>General revelation primes interest
in special revelation</u>. That is the sense in which Paul used general
revelation in presenting the gospel to the pagans in Lystra (Acts <b>14</b>:14-18)
and Athens (Acts <b>17</b>:22-31). The created world around them was the “point
of contact” he used to introduce them to Yahveh with a view to reconciling them
back into relationship with him. In this role, general revelation <u>precedes</u>
special revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B.  <u>General revelation confirms special
revelation</u>. Psalm <b>19</b>:1-6 says that the heavens declare the glory of
God (cp. Isaiah<b> 40</b>:26; Psalm<b> 8</b>; <b>33</b>:4-9; <b>50</b>:6; <b>62</b>:11;
<b>74</b>:12-17; <b>147</b>:4). As a matter of fact, that is what they are
doing. A person with no access to a knowledge of the true God may not realize
that the heavens are declaring the glory of Yahveh rather than some other deity,
pantheon of deities, or nature in operation. At least to believers, the heavens
declare the glory of the God who has previously made himself known to them. It
provides general content both rational and affective. Once there is special
revelation as <u>communication</u>, there can be general revelation for <u>communion</u>.
In this role, general revelation <u>succeeds</u> special revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Romans <b>1</b>:18-32 appeals to general
revelation to confirm special revelation<i>: “<u>Having known</u> God, they did
not glorify him as God . . . but became vain in their reasonings . . .”</i> (<b>1</b>:21).
General revelation is clear enough to keep us who know God from turning away to
some other view of God or some other way of living based on that false
substitute. What we can see in general revelation is clear enough to condemn us
for turning away from what we know by special revelation. Nothing in the world
around us requires any other explanation than the true picture of God we
already have. Since the explanations to which people have turned are less
adequate than the one known through special revelation, we stand condemned by
general revelation for turning away from what we know through that special
revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            C.  <u>General revelation may show the
greater likelihood of theism over atheism</u>. Philosophers have developed
arguments for the existence of God: the ontological argument, the teleological
argument (argument from design), the cosmological argument (the universe is not
sufficient for explaining itself), the moral argument. Different philosophers
consider one or more of these arguments to be valid. Even if the arguments are
valid, they are difficult to defend against some objections. So, the “theistic
proofs” create likelihood for theism than positively proof. Even if valid, they
are inadequate for knowing how to relate to God. In this third role, general
revelation is <u>simultaneous</u> with special revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            General revelation serves these three
functions, but it has three limitations: (a) it cannot prove the existence of
the God of the Bible; if it can, (b) it cannot give an adequate view of him;
and (c) it cannot tell us enough to save ourselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. Integrations</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is a correlation especially between
general revelation and the subjective side of for <u>apologetics</u>. From
interaction with the natural world, we consciously or unconsciously recognize
that life is bigger than we are. Our own nature in this setting creates a sense
of need. The natural order in and around us “primes” our interest in the
answers God gives </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><img width=214 height=140
src="/cir-library/images/essays/notations-on-general-revelation/image002.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>through special revelation to meet those needs. After
the answer in special revelation has been provisionally accepted, new believers
“confirm” the truthfulness of that answer by using it—experiencing its solution
to those perceived needs. They also observe that nothing in experience or
nature requires any other explanation for life and the universe than what special
revelation has taught.                              </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The three roles of general revelation
identified above under “Values of General Revelation,” correlate with the three
aspects of apologetics. <u>Need</u> corresponds with “priming interest in
special revelation.” <u>Answer</u> parallels “showing greater likelihood of
theism over atheism.” <u>Use</u> correlates with “confirming special
revelation.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If there is a correlation between general
revelation and apologetics, then general revelation has a <i>positive</i> role
in <u>evangelism and missions</u> because they deal with commending special
revelation (the gospel) to people with general revelation only. So Paul could
appeal to nature in describing the God he had come to these people to
represent. Additionally, some theologians think that general revelation ends up
having a <i>negative</i> role among the unevangelized: it serves as the basis
of condemnation for all those who have not had access to special revelation. The
two aspects of general revelation—internal conscience (Romans <b>2</b>) and
external creation (Romans <b>1</b>)—combine to leave a person without excuse
for misbelieving and misbehaving. (See “An Alternate View,” below.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> IV. An Alternate View</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The treatment above has assigned to
general revelation a role <u>chronologically prior</u> to special revelation. It
can whet the appetite for hearing proclaimed truth. Another approach says that
general revelation can have a role <u>logically prior</u> to special
revelation. The witness of nature and experience can provide preliminary truths
about God, which then serve as the foundation for special revelation. So to
speak, philosophy precedes theology. By nature around and within, we can come
to a true (albeit incomplete and inadequate) understanding of God. In the
missionary enterprise, we can use reason to show that there is a transcendent,
all-powerful, and perhaps even holy, God and then add the Christian message to
fill out the picture and offer salvation to people alienated from that God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Under this construction of the role of
general revelation, by implication people stands condemned because from
creation and conscience people ought to <u>come to</u> a true knowledge of God
and moral behavior. Their failure to do so reflects their depravity, the fallen
nature supposedly inherited genetically from Adam as a result of his original
sin. Such a view assumes that general revelation is sufficiently clear that people
without depravity to blind them could derive enough from it to condemn them for
perverting their understanding of God and moral behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul’s presentation in Romans <b>1</b> is
cited as evidence for this approach. Appealing to general revelation is
appropriate or the apostle would not have done that in Romans and elsewhere;
but we must ask what purpose he had in mind for referring to general revelation
in these cases. Using it to pique interest, make a point of contact, confirm
special revelation, and even show the likelihood of theism is different from
using it as a logical basis for God’s word revelation. Modern creationists
effectively use the former approach against atheistic evolutionary philosophy. In
Psalm<b> 19</b>, Acts <b>14</b> and <b>17</b>, inspired writers simply affirm
that the heavens declare God’s glory or that he made them. They do not offer
arguments to prove that God created them from nothing. It is not evident that
they are appealing to nature as logical preparation for accepting special
revelation or for condemning people for false views of deity and morality. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That last step is something traditional
thinkers have done. They have tried <b>(1)</b> to demonstrate from reason the
existence and nature of God together with the freedom of humankind and the
immortality of the soul. Then, transitioning from reason to faith, <b>(2)</b>
they call for yielding to the authority of the church to interpret special
revelation. Paul may, in fact, be affirming the opposite of that scenario when
he declares in 1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:20, <i>“The world by its wisdom did not come
to know God. It was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preached
message to save them that believe.”</i> (For a treatment of Romans <b>1</b>,
see the document entitled “The Relationship of General Revelation to Theistic
Philosophy in Romans <b>1-2</b>.”)</span></p>
