<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            When
the Christian gospel came on the scene of redemptive history, the status and
nature of the Mosaic Law came under question. Not only was that question
relevant to the Jews, but the Gentiles also had to cope with it because
Christianity came out of a heritage different from their own. Christendom has demonstrated
five ways of dealing with the issue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>1.
<u>Keeping the Law constitutionally (code and content) and adding the gospel to
it.</u> The Law and the gospel are regarded as two stages of the same thing;
they are compatible. Among the Jews the approach received significant impetus
during the early years of the Gentile mission. Judaizing missionaries received
strong opposition from Paul and Barnabas in Antioch and eventually in Jerusalem
at the Conference on Circumcision recorded in Acts <b>15</b>. In Galatians, 2
Corinthians <b>3</b>, and Romans, Paul vigorously opposed the concept primarily
from a soteriological point of view; but other matters were also implicated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>2.
<u>Throwing away the Law (code and content) as evil/false and retaining the
gospel only</u>. The Law and the gospel are considered antithetical. Marcion,
son of the bishop of Sinope, Pontus, in the second century took that stance and
has as his heirs the modernist movement in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Not far into the ministry of Jesus, we find the Lord
attempting to head off any such inference from his teaching: <i>“Do not think
that I have come to destroy the Law”</i> (Matthew <b>5</b>:17).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>3.
<u>Spiritualizing the Law in terms of the gospel revelation</u>. The Law and
the gospel are perceived to be formally alike, so Christians may seek the
content of the second by the allegorical, analogical, or moral interpretations
of the Law. Already in the second century the quality of Old Testament exegesis
had fallen quite low under the influence of such fanciful methods as appear in <i>The
Shepherd of Hermas</i> and <i>The Epistle of Barnabas</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>4.
<u>Keeping the Law as amended by the gospel</u>. This approach considers the Law
and the gospel as modifications on the same basic expression of God’s will for
his people—his constitution. The formulation seems to be an appropriate way of
expressing the reformed, or covenantal, view of divine economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>5.
<u>Abrogating the Law constitutionally and replacing it with the gospel as to
code</u>. The Law and the gospel are formally different while materially
related. That construction distinguished between code and content so that two
levels of change are possible.</span></p>

     (a) <u>Making the code-content distinction rather than taking the
amendment approach enables us to explain how Christians are not under the Law
(code) without denying the truth or divine source of it (content)</u>. What is
true cannot be abrogated; but since it is the expression of a will, the Person
may modify or change it under appropriate circumstances. A person can then
discriminate between what a Christian is under or not under without pronouncing
the earlier code false.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>                   
    (b) <u>Making the code-content distinction rather than taking the amendment
approach provides a mechanism for distinguishing what in the Law applies to
Christians and what does not</u>. The New Testament revelation lays out the
guidelines for Christian living. Inasfar as these correlate with Old Testament
principles and commandments, the Law may be used as a basis for moral and
ethical behavior. That construction does not require finding a statement of
repeal for each item in the Law that Christians no longer need to keep. In the
amendment approach each matter not repealed is in principle still binding on
Christians. An interpreter can eliminate the dietary laws through Mark <b>7</b>:19
or circumcision via Acts <b>15</b>:13-29, but can he find a way of eliminating
the law of jealousy in Numbers <b>5</b>:11-31? On what basis can a Christian
avoid keeping some aspects of the ceremonial law? Failure to make the
code-content distinction has created problems about Sabbath keeping by
Christians (or at least observing Sunday after the manner of Sabbath observance).
Similarly, the Jewish requirement of tithing has illegitimately been brought in
as a Christian expectancy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>                   
    (c) <u>Making the code-content distinction rather than taking the amendment
approach eliminates having to be able to distinguish between moral law and
positive commandment</u>. The New Testament speaks of the Law as being
abrogated, blotted out, annulled, taken out of the way, nailed to the cross, and
so on (Colossians <b>2</b>:14-15; Hebrews <b>7</b>:18). It sometimes speaks of
civil or ceremonial commandments being annulled as a class. The problem is not
with the concepts of moral, civil, and ceremonial law, but in categorizing specific
cases with composite elements and in establishing the argument that ceremonial
law as such has been abrogated. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>                        Composite
matters like the law of jealousy are difficult because a moral matter (adultery)
is involved, but the method of establishing guilt as prescribed is not. Is it
civil? Perhaps, but we wonder if Jesus’ efficacious sacrifice would necessarily
<i>per se</i> eliminate animal sacrifices; they could continue being offered in
memorial rather than in anticipation of what they were proleptic or reflective shadows
(cp. premillennialists who look for the re-institution of animal sacrifice
during the millennium). Under the code-content approach, such decisions fall
out because the New Testament contents alone establish the normative for
Christian living. The concomitant point is that, morally and religiously,
nothing beyond the contents of the New Testament is normative and binding for
Christians. There is one people of God and one constitution over them at the
present age.</span></p>
