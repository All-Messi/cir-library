only with what people <u>do</u>. That is why (a) there is no change regarding
the <u>nature</u> of things (ontological matters) or matters of <u>history</u>
(events, including prophecy). (b) <u>Civil</u> and <u>ceremonial</u> observances
fall out because national Israel (Moses) and the Old Testament priesthood
(Aaron) have been replaced by the interpersonal church with its ministry and
message. (c) There are few new ceremonial matters—baptism and the Lord’s Supper—that
have come in with Christ. (d) Some modifications in the moral code come in with
progressive revelation. Marriage expectancy shifts from polygamy and divorce-remarriage
possibilities to permanent monogamy standard. (See the broad arrow diagram in
“Old Testament Backgrounds and the Messianic Covenant.”)</span></p>

some guidelines for distinguishing between what of Jesus’ words applies to us
and what applied only to his immediate hearers, who were still under the Mosaic
Law (Matthew <b>23</b>:2-3). The issue is not <u>what is true</u> in what he
said, but <u>to whom the truth applies</u> in what he said. Jesus’ ministry
represented a transition period when he—as well as John the Baptist before him—was
declaring that the kingdom of heaven was at hand but still future. Technically,
he carried on his work during the Mosaic dispensation. <u>Theoretically</u> the
Law was “nailed to the cross” at his death (Colossians <b>2</b>:14). <u>Dispensationally</u>
the gospel began at Pentecost when the apostles could preach the gospel for the
first time in its historical reality, that is, as an accomplished fact in the finished
ministry of Christ. <u>Politically</u> the Mosaic system ended at A.D. 70 at
the fall of Jerusalem, when God allowed the Romans to bring the Old Testament
system to an end. There was a forty-year overlap between the beginning of the
church and the end of national Israel.</span></p>

it is teaching material associated with matters elsewhere known to be
distinctive to the Mosaic covenant and abrogated with the coming of the New
Covenant, matters associated with national Israel (civil, Moses) and the
priesthood system (ceremonial, Aaron). Since we know that national Israel has
been removed, we say civil matters in the Old Testament as well as in the
gospels do not apply to non-Jews and non-Jewish Christians. Since we know that
the Aaronic priesthood has been changed (Psalm <b>110</b>:4 + Hebrews <b>7-10</b>),
we say ceremonial matters (for the priesthood and the temple) do not apply
beyond the national-Israel dispensation. Examples in these areas include (a)
tithing commandments (Matthew <b>23</b>:23-24), (b) legitimacy of Jewish
rulership (Matthew <b>23</b>:2), (c) offerings on the altar, (d) the Israelite
festival cycle (Colossians<b> 2</b>:16-19).</span></p>
