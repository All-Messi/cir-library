<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some authors have suggested that Paul in
his writings for the Gentile mission was opposing the tradition of the elders
rather than the Mosaic Law itself. But the following factors look away from
such a reading of Paul’s concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For one thing, (1) Paul objected to <u>circumcising</u>
Gentiles. Circumcision was a practice related to the Law itself, not just to
the tradition of the elders. The apostle was evidently countering the meaning
of that rite itself, which had associations with Jewish nationalism. Beyond
that, circumcision identified people with law since it identified them with the
Mosaic Law. Consequently, circumcision had a soteriological implication: in
theory it committed people to maintaining relationship with God by committing
them to the principle of personal perfection (Leviticus <b>18</b>:5;
Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:26), the point Paul makes in Galatians <b>3</b>:8-14. Succeeding
at personally doing everything required by law is exactly what none of us do or
have been able to do in a practical sense; we have all sinned, and we continue
to fall short of perfection—“the glory of God” (Romans<b> 3</b>:23). Starting
in spirit (that is, I think, with interpersonal processes with Christ) and
trying to finish in flesh (law, perfection, nationality) attempts to mix
contrary types of things in order to accomplish the <u>righteousness</u> that
is prerequisite for <u>being viewed as righteous</u>, which in turn is
prerequisite for <u>fellowship with God</u>. In effect, the Law was a yoke that
neither first-century Jews nor their fathers were able to bear (Acts <b>15</b>:10).
It was the Law itself that was the yoke, not just the tradition of the elders,
which built a hedge around it by making it stricter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, (2) Paul speaks of “works of
law,” that is, works in a legal sense, or actions in a legal setting. He does
not speak of the traditions of the elders. “Works” does not mean simply doing
something, doing something outward, doing something formal, doing some token
effort, or doing the supererogation involved in the tradition of the elders. It
means doing something that produces righteousness, that is, perfection, which
could theoretically commend us to God. In human and divine-human affairs, there
has to be more involved in establishing and maintaining an interpersonal
relationship than just the doing by the person on one side of that
relationship, because perfection is always the standard for all relationships
human or divine, and perfection is not practically attainable by humans in the
first place and not theoretically attainable by us in the second place, that
is, once the perfection is broken. From the other side of the relationship must
additionally come forgiveness upon repentance for the failures and
disobediences of imperfect people. The repentance-forgiveness process addresses
the ever-present difference between performance and perfection in relationships
that involve human persons. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) The role and work of Christ is to be
understood <u>in contrast to</u> the divine efforts that went before, not in
contrast to the human efforts represented in the tradition of the elders. Certainly,
Christ’s work is not to be understood within the context of law—within the
parameters of legal process, but within the context of interpersonal
relationship. That point is clear from the fact that Paul interprets Christ’s
work in connection with the promise to Abraham, which came 430 years before law
became a factor in divine economy—and then only as a temporary add-on
(Galatians <b>3</b>:15-20) for practical rather than theoretical purposes. Legal
and non-legal are different systems and different kinds of systems. The
covenant through Christ is a return—or reaffirmation—of the original kind of
process involved in “promise” to Abraham; it is “faith,” another Pauline code
word for what we are calling “interpersonal.” The grace-faith system contrasts
with the law-works system. There is then a more profound difference between the
Judaizers and Paul than the difference between the Law and the tradition of the
elders. The last two are of the same kind, with the tradition of the elders
carrying legal principles to a greater extreme—in fact, “going to seed” on
legal principles. There is a difference in kind, however, between Messianism
and what went before.</span></p>
