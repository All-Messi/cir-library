<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>The Structure and Content of the Laws</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>1. The Ten Commandments are a civil
code in an interpersonal setting, the core statements of a national
constitution for a theocratic entity—a political nation ruled by God. Exodus<b>
20</b>:6 speaks of God’s <u>showing lovingkindness</u> to those who <u>love</u>
him. Even the Sabbath commandment has an interpersonal intent, <i>“The seventh
day is a ‘Sabbath [rest] to the L</i></span><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:115%'>ORD</span></i><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'> your God.’”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> As
Jesus said, <i>“The Sabbath was made for mankind” </i>(Mark <b>2</b>:27). The listing
in Deuteronomy <b>5</b> soon leads into the Shema, <i>“Hear, O Israel . . . <u>Love</u>
the L</i></span><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>ORD</span></i><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> your God with all your heart, soul,
and mind” </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>(<b>6</b>:4).
The interpersonal informs the civil; the legal overlays the interpersonal in a
way that does not vitiate that more basic reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>2. Relationship to the L</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>ORD</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'> sets the framework for the rest of the commandments
as they refer to his relationship to national Israel and to relationships
between its citizens. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>3. The importance of these
injunctions is illustrated by their originally being inscribed on stone by <i>“the
finger of God” </i>himself—both the first and second copies (Exodus <b>31</b>:18;
<b>32</b>:15-16; <b>34</b>:1, 28; Deuteronomy<b> 9</b>:10; <b>10</b>:2-4; <b>4</b>:13).
Disobeying six of the ten was a capital crime—as asterisked above, punishable
by stoning (Deuteronomy <b>22</b>:24), burning (Leviticus <b>20</b>:14), or the
sword (Exodus <b>32</b>:27). Slander of a wife’s honor is severely punished by lashes
and fines (Deuteronomy <b>22</b>:18-19).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>4. Exodus and Deuteronomy list the
commandments in the same order. The partial lists in the New Testament do not
reproduce that order (Matthew <b>19</b>:18-19 = Luke <b>18</b>:20; Romans <b>13</b>:8-10;
cp. James <b>2</b>:11).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>5. Commandments 1-9 are overt, hence
actionable by judges, but commandment 10 focuses inward on psychological
concerns actionable by the L</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
115%'>ORD</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>. The inner and
the outer naturally combine because <i>“out of the heart flow the issues of
life”</i> (Proverbs <b>4</b>:23), and the outer trains the inner in the habits
of righteous living.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>6. Commandments 1-5 are vertical, 6-9
are horizontal, and 10 looks inward. The vertical precedes the horizontal, and
respecting parents (5) splices between 1-4 and 6-10.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>7. The commandments mix religious
(1-3), patriotic (4), and moral elements since Israel was a theocrasy. When the
New Testament speaks of annulling the Law, it is speaking at the code level,
which is replaced by a new code, so to speak the “law” of Christ (Colossians <b>2</b>:14,
<i>“nailed to the cross”</i>; Galatians <b>2-4)</b>. The new code/covenant re-incorporates
most of these foundational principles. An individual <u>civil</u> item like Sabbath
observance (Colossians<b> 2</b>:16) falls away because in the Christian era
God’s people no longer constitute a political entity; the Sabbath was a sign
between the L</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>ORD</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> and that political entity (Exodus <b>31</b>:12,
16-17) and was a memorial of the founding of that nation under Moses
(Deuteronomy <b>5</b>:15). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Religious <u>ceremonial</u>
observances (beyond the Decalogue) have likewise dropped out because they were
shadows of the grace and reality that Christ fulfilled (John <b>1</b>:17;
Hebrews <b>8</b>:5; <b>10</b>:1). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>That leaves the basic features of
divine <u>worship and service</u> as well as <u>moral</u> conduct that by
nature do not change with time or place, being rooted in reality—the real
nature of God, mankind, and the interpersonal relationships between them. So,
the Law, of which the Ten Commandments were the core, prepared for the final personal
revelation in the Messiah (Galatians <b>3</b>:24-25). The core elements remain
except for Sabbath observance because the other nine are inherently
interpersonal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>8. Commandment 10 “bats clean-up”; it
covers what 1-9 does not address specifically. Paul uses it to indicate the
high level of righteousness the Law calls for (Romans <b>7</b>:7-12). The last
is the most invasive and pervasive of the ten. It was the commandment that the
rich young ruler could not fully carry out though he thought he had kept the
laws from his youth up: <i>“he was very rich”</i> (Luke <b>18</b>:23 = Matthew <b>19</b>:23
= Mark 1<b>0</b>:22). Not coveting eliminates all forms and degrees of self-centeredness.
The first and tenth commandments serve as bookends: the first sets the
framework; the tenth sets the depth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>9. Eight commandments are worded
primarily in the negative. That may reflect the general relationship between
state (Israel) and church (personal relationships). National law (state)
restrains and restricts evil from the worst downward in negative application
while religion (church) works from the bottom up in positive formulation of
attitude and motive. It stresses what people should do rather than nothing or
instead, <i>“How does the love of God exist in people with means who see their
brother in need and show no compassion?”</i> (1 John <b>3</b>:17); it
eliminates sins of omission and establishes a positive standard with no limits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Furthermore, some
negatives in these directives imply corresponding positives. To forbid lying
implies telling the truth. The prohibition against coveting forestalls
stealing. Not coveting even connects with respecting God above self-interests.
Satan’s temptation in the Garden was for us to decide right and wrong for ourselves
(Genesis <b>3</b>:4-7, 22). Paul calls coveting idolatry, having oneself as a
kind of highest frame of reference (Colossians <b>3</b>:5).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>10. Governing a whole nation long-term
by ten brief laws may seem surprising. The original copies covered two sides of
just two stone tablets that Moses could carry down from Mount Sinai and up the
mountain (Exodus <b>32</b>:15; <b>34</b>:4) and put in the ark of the covenant
(Exodus <b>40</b>:20; Deuteronomy <b>10</b>:5). But that minimal legislation
covers the essential bases. By implication they enjoin what is <u>like</u> them
in kind, attitude, and motive; what are <u>extensions</u> of them, what are <u>aspects
of the situation</u> each involves, and what are <u>other degrees</u> of these
prohibitions. Using the L</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>ORD</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>’s name in vain includes blasphemy (Leviticus
<b>24</b>:10-16). From the law against murder Jesus inferred prohibition
against anger and verbal abuse (Matthew <b>5</b>:21-26)). He said that the law
against adultery implied not nursing lust or using divorce to avoid adultery
(Matthew <b>5</b>:27-33). <i>“Honor your father and mother” </i>implies taking
care of them when they cannot take care of themselves. Jesus used that
principle as a corrective on the “Corban” practice, which allowed offspring to
give assets to the temple instead of using them to care for parents (Mark <b>7</b>:10-13).
He presented his teaching as <i>“fulfilling the Law and the prophets”</i>
(Matthew <b>5</b>:17-20).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The even briefer summary of core
directives, not included in the Decalogue, is covered by the First and Second Great
Commandments: <i>“Love God”</i> (Matthew <b>22</b>:36-38 &lt; Deuteronomy <b>6</b>:5)
and <i>“Love your neighbor as yourself”</i> (Matthew <b>22</b>:39; cp.<b> 7</b>:12;
Romans <b>13</b>:8-10; Galatians <b>5</b>:14; James <b>2</b>:8 &lt; Leviticus <b>19</b>:18).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>11. God issued the Decalogue after he
had authenticated himself to the Jewish people by unleashing ten plagues on the
Egyptians, by protecting the Israelites from those plagues, by delivering the
Jews from bondage, by destroying Egypt’s army in the Red Sea, by providing his
people with water, manna, and quail in a wilderness that could not support a wandering
nation of perhaps 2,000,000 people and their livestock. At the front of his
covenant, he identifies himself as the L</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:115%'>ORD</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>
who gave all those benefits, and in the process demonstrated his supremacy over
Egypt’s gods and over nature itself. After issuing the commandments, the text records
stupendous displays of thunder, lightning, trumpet sounds, thick darkness, and
smoke rising from the mountain (Exodus <b>20</b>:18-21). First, the L</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>ORD</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'> gave Israel reasons to trust him; then he called on
them to respect and obey him and to live together according to these core
commandments.</span></p>
