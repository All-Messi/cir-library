is an educational principle he observed in working to achieve his purpose of a
new united mankind (Ephesians <b>2</b>:15). Over the centuries he has increased
people’s readiness for spiritual growth by (1) giving progressive revelation,
(2) instituting present forms for later realities, and even (3) adopting human
forms to serve as shadows of later substances. Establishing covenants
illustrates this third use of readiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Covenants were common
throughout the Middle East in biblical times. <u>A covenant was a formalized
agreement between parties</u>. The term covered a broad range of agreements
between individuals, between groups, and between individuals and groups. Covenants
could regulate a relationship about a single issue or the whole of life, and
they could take place between equals or unequals. In this last respect,
covenants are categorized as “parity covenants” or “suzerainty covenants.” The
Mosaic covenant is an example of the latter. (See below: “Addendum: Covenants
Mentioned in the Old Testament.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The more formal covenants of
the ancient Near East had a common set of elements, several of which appear in
Exodus <b>19-24</b> taken as a covenant form: (a) a <u>preamble</u> identifying
the covenant parties, (b) a <u>historical prologue</u> outlining events that
led up to making the covenant (<b>19</b>:4), (c) <u>stipulations</u> (<b>19</b>:5-6,
20-23), (d) a list of divine <u>witnesses</u>, (e) a <u>statement of blessings
and curses</u> for obedience and disobedience (<b>20</b>:1-17), the taking of
oaths (<b>19</b>:8; <b>24</b>:3), the performing of ceremonies of ratification
(<b>24</b>:4-8), and the creating of a covenant document (<b>24</b>:7). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Covenants were ratified by a
ritual act performed by the covenant parties. Covenant signs included the
slaughter of an animal that was cut into parts (Genesis <b>15</b>:9-11, 17),
circumcision (Genesis <b>17</b>), putting the hand under the other’s thigh
(Genesis <b>24</b>:2; <b>47</b>:29), or setting up a visible symbol of
remembrance like a pillar or even a pile of stones (Genesis <b>31</b>:44-54;
cp. Joshua <b>4</b>:5-7). For details, see <i>New International Standard Bible
Encyclopedia</i>, Vol. 1, pp. 790-93.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This background sets the
context for the Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Messianic covenants recorded in Holy
Writ. We see an added appropriateness to the manner of making these covenants. In
giving the Law through Moses, God adapted this cultural practice, first, to
bring the Israelite nation closer to his will and, second, to foreshadow
further progress through the predicted Messianic covenant.</span></p>

Messianic</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  Models for
Mosaic-Messianic covenant relationship</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  When the Christian
gospel came on the scene of redemptive history, the status and use of the
Mosaic Law came into question. Not only was this question relevant to Jews, but
it was even more crucial for Gentile converts, whose background did not lie in
the Judaism. Was Messianism an extension of the Mosaic covenant or a
replacement for it? The problem manifested itself particularly in the
controversy over circumcising Gentile Christians. Christendom has responded in
five different ways to this question about Mosaic-Christian covenant
relationships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  1.   <u>Adding the
gospel to the Law</u>. The Law and the gospel are compatible stages of the same
thing. Many Jews took this view during the early years of the Gentile mission. Judaizing
missionaries first clashed with Paul and Barnabas in Antioch and then later at
the conference on circumcision in Jerusalem (Acts <b>15</b>). In Galatians, 2
Corinthians <b>3</b>, and Romans, Paul vigorously opposed this view primarily
from a salvation perspective; but other matters pertained as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  2.   <u>Discarding the
Law as false and retaining the gospel only</u>. The Law and the gospel are
antithetical. Marcion, son of the bishop of Sinope, Pontus, in the second
century took this view and has as his heirs the modernist movement of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Early in his ministry, Jesus himself
attempted to head off any such inference from his teaching: <i>“Do not think
that I have come to destroy the law” </i>(Matthew<b> 5</b>:17). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  3.   <u>Spiritualizing
the law in terms of the gospel</u>. The Law and the gospel are formally alike,
so hermeneutically the content of the gospel can be derived from the language
of the Old Testament by using analogy and allegory. Already in the second
century, the quality of interpretation in some quarters had fallen quite low
because of such fanciful exegesis. <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i> and <i>The Epistle
of Barnabas</i> are examples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  4.   <u>Amending the Law
with the gospel</u>. The Law and the gospel are modifications of the same
expression of God’s constitution for his people. This formulation shows up in
the reformed, or covenantal, view of divine economy. But, there is a difference
in degree between amending the Law in this way and adding the gospel to the Law
(#1 above). Adding the gospel to the Law leaves unchanged everything in the
body of the constitution (with the exception of sacrifices for sin) whereas
amending the law removes and alters provisions within the body as well as
brings in new elements. This approach was what the Judaizers of apostolic days
were evidently supposing should happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  5.   <u>Repealing the Law
in favor of the gospel replacement</u>. Instead of the previous four options,
we adopt this model for understanding the Law-gospel connection. The Law and
the gospel are different covenants. The Messianic covenant is not to the Mosaic
covenant what the Moab covenant (Deuteronomy <b>29-30</b>) was to the Sinai
covenant (Exodus <b>19-24</b>; cp. Deuteronomy <b>5</b>). It is not a <u>re-affirmation</u>
or <u>extension</u> of the Mosaic Law. The Law is not simply <u>changed</u>
(cp. Hebrews <b>7</b>:12); it is <u>ex</u>changed for the gospel covenant. Jeremiah
<b>31</b>:31-34 calls it a “new” covenant. On the background of this prophecy,
Paul comments that the previous ministration <i>“is done away”</i> (2
Corinthians <b>3</b>:11, cp. <b>3</b>:7), and the Hebrews writer says that the
old covenant is <i>“vanishing away,” </i>historically speaking (<b>8</b>:13). The
repeal-replace model involves <u>one people of God</u> and one constitution
over them—the Messianic covenant. It does not bring in a second people of God
under a different covenant that leaves the first covenant in force over the
former group (“one fold,” John <b>10</b>:16; cp. Ephesians <b>4</b>:5-6). The
former passes away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B.   Features of the
repeal-replace model</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  1.   The behavior
category</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Behavior is all
that covenants—hence, change of covenants—address; <u>history</u> and <u>nature</u>
are aside from the issue. The Old Testament is <i>retained</i> (a) as an
inspired record of <u>human deeds</u>, of <u>divine acts</u>, of <u>God’s will</u>
for the Jews’ behavior, and of <u>predictive prophecy</u> (history). It is <i>retained</i>
(b) as a statement about the nature of God and the creation (ontology). It
continues to be <i>useful</i> even (c) as <u>a witness to moral principles</u>
as guided by New Testament parameters (1 Timothy <b>1</b>:8; behavior). Exchanging
the Law for the gospel is not a question about truth but about relevance—not
about accuracy and inspiration but about application.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Civil,
ceremonial, and moral matters are the only issues because they are things that
people <u>do</u>. History, geography, doctrine, nature, and predictive prophecy
are not “terms” of behavioral relationship between covenant parties. A covenant
deals with promises and expectations, which correspond with the two parties of
the covenant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  2.   Adjustments in
the behavior category</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The Law and the
gospel are different covenants (code), though they include many of the same
promises and expectancies (content). Christians are not under the Law, but much
of what it required is required also in their own covenant. <u>Similarity</u>
exists between the covenants because God’s overall purpose for humankind has
been the same since creation and because the nature of God and people is
unchanged, which means that the appropriate manner of their relating vertically
and horizontally is the same.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <u>Dissimilarity</u>
exists because of (1) God’s increased expectancy for his people (<u>moral</u>),
because (2) God has removed the national component (<u>civil</u>) in favor of a
purely interpersonal system—and the corresponding promises that belonged to the
nation and race. Dissimilarity exists because (3) Mosaic <u>ceremonial</u>
observances have been superseded by the Messianic realities they foreshadowed,
and because some new ordinances have been enacted. Finally, dissimilarity
exists because (4) new responsibilities have been added for people in the
covenant, especially toward people outside the covenant. These additional
aspects were already implicit in the First and Second Great Commandments
verbalized within the Old Covenant itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  3.   The common
purpose and content</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        While the Mosaic
covenant and the Messianic covenant are indeed different covenants, they have a
common purpose and share the common content already noted. They represent two
stages in the larger context of the same redemptive history. As to <u>code</u>
there is distinction, but<b> </b>as to <u>content</u> there is significant
continuity as adjusted by progressive stages within God’s ongoing efforts to
bring about human righteousness and divine-human relationship.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The law is <u>superseded</u>—more
than antithesized—by a more refined expression of God’s will for people and by
a real means of reconciliation with God. “Superseded” means that the former is <u>related</u>
to the latter and related to it in a <u>preparatory</u> way. Paul says that the
gospel <i>“establishes the Law” </i>(Romans <b>3</b>:31; cp. <b>8</b>:4). Jesus
came to “fulfill” the Law (Matthew <b>5</b>:17). The gospel supersedes the Law
with higher expectancies and better promises. The two covenants are in series,
not in parallel. The resulting situation is also not two parallel systems, but
one people of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  4.   The different
kinds of covenants</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Finally, in
addition to being different covenants with a sequential common purpose, the
Mosaic and Messianic Covenants are different kinds of covenants. Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34
says that the New Covenant is <u>not like</u> the one God made with the Israelites
when he brought them out of Egypt: the New Covenant is written on the heart
(cp. 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:6-11), everyone in it knows God, and people’s sins
are no longer remembered. The <u>results</u> of the covenants differ in that
God no longer reckons sins under the New Covenant, but more importantly the <u>character</u>
of the New Covenant differs: now only those personally related to God (“know”)
and only those who have internalized the values of the covenant are in any
sense part of the covenant. No one can be born into it or inducted into it on
some other artificial, ceremonial, legal basis. If a person does not adopt the <u>values</u>
of the covenant, there is nothing left (national citizenship, physical descent,
<i>e.g</i>.) to identify that person as being under the covenant. In short, the
Messianic Covenant is an interpersonal covenant whereas the Mosaic Covenant was
also legal and political/national. The Messianic Covenant is <u>on the analogy
of</u> the Mosaic Covenant; it is not <u>another example of</u> that kind of
covenant.</span></p>

18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            C.  Advantages of the
repeal-replace model</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In Christendom today
the most common ways of relating the Mosaic and Christian Covenants are the
amendment approach and the repeal-replace approach. The following observations
show the advantages of the latter properly formulated.                                                                   1.         <u>The
repeal-replace model <i>vs</i>. the amendment approach clarifies how Christians
are not under the Law (code) without denying the truth and divine source of the
Law (content)</u>. What is true cannot be abrogated; but since a covenant
expresses one person’s will for another person’s behavior, it may be modified
or changed appropriately under changed circumstances and refined purposes. We
can discriminate between what we are under and what we are not under without
calling the latter false.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  2.   <u>The
repeal-replace model <i>vs.</i> the amendment approach provides a mechanism for
distinguishing what in the Law applies likewise to Christians and what does not</u>.
The New Covenant establishes the guidelines for Christian living. Insofar as
they correlate with Old Covenant principles and commandments, the Law is useful
for ethical decisions even today. We need not, however, find a statement of
repeal for each item in the Law that Christians no longer observe. In amendment
theory any matter not repealed is still in force. To be sure, we could
eliminate several items on a one-by-one basis: dietary laws (Mark <b>7</b>:19),
circumcision (Acts <b>15</b>), sin offerings (Hebrews <b>10</b>:1-10), temple ritual
(Hebrews <b>9</b>), the priesthood system and its duties (Hebrews <b>7-8</b>),
civil marriage regulations (Matthew <b>19</b>:3-9; <b>5</b>:31-32). How can we
eliminate, though, the law of jealousy in Numbers <b>5</b>? Can we avoid
keeping some aspects of the ceremonial law, especially those not antitypical of
the Messianic sacrifice? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        There was
evidently a rationale that stemmed from the difference in the purposes of the
covenants that led particularly to Paul’s inferences about what Gentile
converts were obliged to do and not to begin doing. It does not seem likely
that his stricture against observing the Jewish festival cycle (Galatians <b>4</b>:10)
was based on sheer authority, even if it were God’s sheer authority. In
general, the <u>expressed</u> changes in New Covenant are based in something
real as to God’s overall intent in salvation history rather than in sheer,
arbitrary change of expectancy. Alternatives must derive from principles like
(a) when the perfect comes, the preliminary ceases in deference to it (cp. 1
Corinthians <b>13</b>:10) and (b) when the temporary becomes irrelevant to
overall purpose, it disappears. The rationale then can be extended to
unexpressed possible changes as based on the proper understanding of the nature
and purpose of the New Covenant—as interpersonal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  3.   <u>The
repeal-replace model <i>vs</i>. the amendment approach eliminates having to
distinguish successfully between moral law and positive commandment</u>. The
New Testament speaks of the <u>Law</u> as being abrogated, blotted out,
annulled, taken out of the way, and so on (Colossians <b>2</b>:14-15; Hebrews <b>7</b>:18);
it does not speak just about annulling individual items. It speaks of
sacrificial ceremonies being annulled as a class (Hebrews <b>10</b>:1ff). The
problem is not with moral, civil, and ceremonial as concepts, but with
categorizing cases that combine moral and ceremonial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Composite
matters like the law of jealousy alluded to above are difficult because the
moral matter of adultery is involved, but there is also a prescribed method of
establishing guilt regarding adultery. One could conceivably claim that Jesus’
sacrifice did not eliminate sacrificial offerings; they could continue as
memorials rather than as anticipations of the Christ reality (cp. some pre-millennialists
who anticipate the re-institution of animal sacrifice during the millennium). Somewhat
similar is the Roman Catholic mass, which in theory re-enacts Christ’s
redemptive work. Under the repeal-replace approach, such questions can be
settled because the New Testament contents alone are adequate for Christian
life and worship.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Morally and
religiously speaking, nothing beyond the contents of the New Testament is
normative for Christians. The repeal-replace model establishes a positive
burden of proof for deciding about Christian obligations. What the New
Testament does not include or necessarily imply is not required. The amendment
model implies a negative burden of proof. It assumes that an item of duty is
still binding unless we can show that it is <u>not</u>. The negative burden of
proof is more difficult to bear, and therefore frequently inadequate. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  4.  <u>The
repeal-replace model<i> vs</i>. the amendment approach allows the Messianic
covenant to be a different<i> kind</i> of covenant</u>. The New Testament is a
different covenant as to <u>identity</u>, but it is also a different covenant
as to <u>kind</u> (Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34). It does not have a national
component like the Mosaic covenant, and it is not a legal system as Mosaism
was.  An amendment approach leaves the covenants as being of the same kind, but
the second covenant is essentially interpersonal only. Not only is the <i>content</i>
different, but the <i>character</i> of the common content is transformed as
well. In some ways this consideration is the most crucial of all because it
changes the quality of moral behavior from law-keeping to love-keeping. It is
now an <u>interpersonal</u> framework in which good is defined as good
relationship. The motivations of the heart are necessarily included in our overtly
doing good. We are not limited to the specifications in the Law, but operate
also in terms of wisdom, expediency, and love. Good and bad are not just
quantifiable do’s and don’t’s; they are characteristic ways of behaving that
stem from attitude and purpose. Grace-faith does not take place within a larger
legal context, but in the alternative context of interpersonal relationships. In
fact, grace-faith <i>vs</i>. law-works are Pauline code words respectively for
interpersonal <i>vs</i>. legal operations. Legal operation was intended to be
added onto interpersonal process in a way that did not vitiate the
interpersonal. That point relates to <i>“using the law’ lawfully’”</i> (1
Timothy<b> 1</b>:8).</span></p>

with God), (9) assumptions about <u>Israel-church relationship</u>, (10) the <u>clergy</u>
concept, which addresses the nature and role of ministry in contrast to
priesthood (sacerdotalism—the official administration of ordinances, the use of
the confessional, leadership style, and the like), (11) the <u>nature and
operation of the church</u>, and (12) the <u>theology of the church</u>—whether
grace flows from God through the church to the individual (legally) or from God
directly to the individual (interpersonally).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Confusion of covenants can
have a subtle, and significant, effect on hermeneutical method, which shows
itself, for example, in manifestations of the silence-is-prohibition principle:
(13) <u>worship</u> (instrumental music, church buildings, choirs, <i>etc</i>.)
and (14) <u>church organization</u> (no Sunday schools, parachurch agencies, <i>etc</i>.,
because the organization of the church is <i>complete</i>). Legal system
statements have a much greater tendency to be meant in a restrictive <i>vs.</i>
non-restrictive sense. Possibilities parallel to the ones specified have no
positive basis for being brought into the picture. That is the reason people who
interpret the New Testament with a legal hermeneutic are prone to ask how some
non-biblical practice is “justified” when other people see no reason for
needing to justify it—Sunday schools, singing in parts, singing songs of human
composure, and the like. In some important ways, the interpretation of law
differs from the interpretation of interpersonal communication. It makes a
corresponding difference whether we regard the New Testament as having the same
character as the Law of Moses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Covenants were a common
feature of ancient New Eastern culture. The covenant concept covered a wide
range of formal agreements between parties. In the Old Testament literature, we
see God using covenant repeatedly to provide terminology, structure, and forms
for his approximating efforts at moving people away from sin toward
righteousness for purposes of personal relationship to him and his eternal
agenda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The range of covenant types
and circumstances is broad enough to incorporate both a national covenant like
that between Yahveh and Israel and an interpersonal covenant like the one
between Messiah and his people. These two covenants are (a) <u>different</u>
covenants, (b) different <u>kinds</u> of covenants, and covenants that share
(c) significant <u>common content</u> because they have (d) <u>common purpose</u>.
They are covenants that represent (e) <u>successive stages</u> within (f) the <u>same
redemptive history</u> with (g) the <u>first covenant preparing for the second</u>.
Since the two covenants are analogous rather than identical, there is (h) a <u>different
character to even the common material</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Distinction of covenants
applies only to <u>commanded material</u>. Inside commanded material, <u>civil</u>
and <u>ceremonial</u> obligations drop out while <u>moral</u> expectancies
continue with adjustments because moral behavior is a major component in
relationship to God and others and therefore relevancy to the eternal purposes
of God for humankind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            By seeing, on the one hand,
that the Mosaic and Messianic Covenants form successive stages in the same
redemptive history, we can appreciate the unity and continuity that exists
between them and the progression that occurs in moving from the former to the
latter. By seeing, on the other hand, the discontinuity that exists between
them, we will be less tempted to return to the shadows and types of the former
economy. Hopefully that means we will make the appropriate interpretation
adjustments involved in moving from the legal genre to the interpersonal
communication of the New Covenant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Few matters affect Christian
practice as much as relationship of covenants does. The number of controversies
that have arisen over this one issue make it paramount that we grasp as clearly
as possible the association that exists between Old and New Covenants. The
unity of those in the Messianic Covenant is at stake.</span></p>
