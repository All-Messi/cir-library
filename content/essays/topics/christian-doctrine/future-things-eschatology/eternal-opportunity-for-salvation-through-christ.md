style='font-size:12.0pt'> I. An Unnecessary Concept </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On the assumption, for the moment, that
eternal opportunity for salvation through Christ could not be <u>dis</u>proved,
we should consider several matters. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  <u>Other preferable observations
adjust our understanding of hell so that eternal option is unnecessary</u>. A
big impetus for the doctrine of eternal option comes from the apparent
impropriety of a loving God torturing sinners endlessly in hell for no <u>remedial</u>
<u>purpose</u>; <u>punitive purpose</u> seems not to call for such severity if
punishment should be commensurate with the crime. Several factors reduce the
urgency of this “problem.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  1.   <u>Sliding-scale judgment</u>. If
God judges on a sliding scale, he can take into account that a person did not
hear the gospel, was poorly exposed to the gospel, faced more temptation or
persecution than others, and other variables. God can gather up the inequities during
the time of proclamation and apply them at the time of judgment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Sliding-scale judgment
contrasts with static judgment. Jesus says, <i>“To whom much is given, of him
much will be required”</i> (Luke <b>12</b>:48). He implied that God’s
expectancy takes into account differences in opportunity, knowledge, ability,
and anything else that lies beyond people’s control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Within the concept of
sliding-scale judgment lies the question about <u>unevangelized elect</u>. At
least we can say that scripture does not teach that all those who have not
heard of Christ are automatically lost because of that factor, which they could
not control. It teaches that all salvation is figured relative to Christ
whether people lived in the patriarchal period (1 Peter <b>3-4</b>), under the
Mosaic Law (Hebrews <b>9</b>:15), outside of Israel (Romans <b>1</b>:14-16), or
under Christian proclamation (1 Timothy <b>4</b>:10). That leaves the
unevangelized after Christ. Previous examples from the patriarchal and Mosaic
periods show that being saved by Christ and hearing about Christ do not amount
to the same thing, which leaves open the possibility of applying that principle
to the unevangelized after Christ as surely as it applied to earlier people who
had not heard of him. This view differs from eternal option in that it does not
involve a change of status from lost to saved after death; it only affirms that
in judging people relative to factors on this side of death, God could demonstrate
consistency in both his love <u>and</u> his holiness in saving an unevangelized
person on appropriate conditions. The variable is handled in the judgment
process itself rather than in a later change from saved to lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  2.   <u>Degrees of punishment</u>. All
sins are alike in kind but not in degree. While all sins are alike in being
contrary to divine intent, they are not equal in <u>how</u> contrary they are
to divine intent as they relate to their nature and purpose. The results of
some sins are more far-reaching than others, and hell can punish commensurately
with the severity of the sin as measured by consequences. Luke records Jesus’
comments that some will be beaten with many stripes depending on what they knew
or should have figured out on their own if their attitudes and motives were
right (Luke <b>12</b>:47-48).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  3.   <u>Hell as separation from God</u>.
The interpersonal framework predicts at least that hell is separation from God,
whatever the actual form of existence that separation entails. As long as we
speak only of possibilities, we may speculate on various options that would be
appropriate. Eternal separation might mean not only permanent separation from
God, but eternal <u>loneliness</u>. Sin is virtually always a form of
self-centeredness, and behaving selfishly is contrary to social relations. Losing
the possibility of fellowship could be what “destroy” means. Being created in
the image of God means having interpersonal capacity; hence, removing the
option would be “destruction.” Another form of that separation could be, not
loneliness, but relationships only with other sinners angelic, demonic, human,
or otherwise. The separation would be from God in the sense of not being in his
grace—or in his “good graces.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Such a scenario would be <u>hell
as poetic justice</u>. Along with whatever else, hell amounts to giving people
what they implicitly sought in separating themselves from God and behaving
self-centeredly toward other people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  4.   <u>Biblical descriptions of
hell as figurative</u>. Comments under the previous heading imply that orthodox
understanding of certain condemnation texts may interpret them as figurative. We
infer that it should do so. We do not know much about the nature of the
resurrection condition, specifically about the resurrection body. It is called
a glorified body (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:1-8); we assume that it is asexual
(Matthew <b>22</b>:30); we cannot tell how far Jesus meant for us to parallel
our resurrected condition with that of angels, who are ministering “spirits”
(Hebrews <b>1</b>:14) and so do not have flesh and bones (Luke <b>24</b>:39). So,
it is difficult to say whether the corporeality implied by fire is even cogent
if taken literally. Furthermore, fire imagery does not mix with outer darkness
imagery (<b>22</b>:13), which implies that one or both are imageries. Fire and
brimstone may serve as graphic pictures of how bad it really is—hot and smelly—to
be separated from the holy, loving God, the Ultimate Reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        We mean comments of this sort to
be tentative and suggestive rather than dogmatic and doctrinal. They are done
with the same mentality and motive as Abraham’s use of s “sanctified
imagination” to justify God who promised him a lineage through Isaac before
commanding him to sacrifice Isaac. Our suggestions above on hell enables us to
continue serving God as <u>believers</u> instead of ceasing to do so because we
have found the Judaeo-Christian faith to be false by self-contradiction.
Similarly, humble speculation can remove an unnecessary stumbling block to the
conversion of present <u>disbelievers</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  5.   <u>Hell as the result of
personal sin only</u>. We set aside any notion that the eternal destiny of one
person is caused by another person’s sin or goodness. Sin is not transferable
because sin is an act and acts are not transferrable. So, we reject the notion
of original guilt unto eternal condemnation, particularly when combined with unconditional
election. Likewise, we set aside the unworthy notion about the “treasury of the
saints,” where earlier Christians did more than necessary, and so their
leftovers could be transferred to others who could gain some more good works on
their tally sheet.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  6.   <u>Eschatological limit</u>. The
biblical witness on eternal states may not be sufficiently clear to reach firm
conclusions, given the possibility of poetic exaggeration for emphasis in the
Book of Revelation and elsewhere. Under that view, the witness of scripture
addresses what is pertinent to our present living; a veil lies across the rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The “hell” problem has fostered several
ideas. Among them is <b>(a) </b>the notion of <u>subjective <i>vs</i>.
objective lostness</u>. In God’s mind (objectively), everyone is regarded as
saved through Christ. Some, however, may never come to accept their acceptance,
which results in a hell of their own making. Another idea is <b>(b)</b> <u>conditional
immortality</u>, or the similar concept called annihilationism. The best form
of this approach says that the unsaved cease to exist—or are positively
destroyed—after judgment and a variable length or degree of punishment
appropriate to the degree of their sinfulness. Fairly close to conditional
immortality but less biblical would be <b>(c) </b><u>death as final end</u>. Sinners
cease to exist at death; only the saved are resurrected. <b>(d) </b>The concept
of <u>purgatory</u> relates to this issue as well. Hell is for purification,
variable punishment, and remediation. Then, of course, there is <b>(e) </b><u>eternal
option for salvation</u>, also called “the larger hope.” That view is a form of
universalism—at least <u>potential</u> objective universalism. A more extreme
form of universalism is the notion of <b>(f)</b> <u>earthly “hell</u>.” During
life here, sinners experience enough of sin’s consequences to compensate for
their disobedience. A helpful resource for introducing the subject of hell is <i>Four
Views on Hell</i>, edited by William Crockett, Zondervan Publishing House,
1992. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B.  <u>The eternal option doctrine does
not bear its burden of proof</u>. Quite typically, people hit on an idea that
seems to solve a problem; and they find that it “fits with” things scripture <u>does</u>
say. The difficulty is that <u>another</u> idea may also “fit with,” or
“account for,” those same statements. Under such conditions it is misleading to
say that these things “support” a conclusion when they would “support” other
conclusions as well. As long as there is more than one way to handle the data, proposals
remain opinions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the case of eternal option,
however, we would be doing more than holding it as an opinion; we would be
claiming that scripture teaches it. Since it does not obviously do so to the
exclusion of other possibilities, we would find ourselves <i>“adding to the
word of God,”</i> which would make us false teachers. For the sake of brevity
here, we simply affirm that none of the texts appealed to for the idea of
eternal option to salvation are adequate to establish the doctrine.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> II. A Concept That Creates Problems</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Not only is the concept of eternal option an
un necessary reading of certain texts, it also creates contradictions with
other matters revealed in scripture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  <u>Implies universalism</u>. Although
it may not at first seem to do so, eternal option implies either that
universalism is the case or that the problem of evil is insoluble. If the
salvation option is left open long enough to redeem all the evil, then
potential universalism becomes actual universalism; so universalism is the
case. If universalism does not realize its potential, evil is not finally
conquered. If a holy God creates what he knows will sin without at the same
time knowing that he will decisively deal with that sinful creation, he becomes
unholy by creating a situation that is permanently contradictory to his own
holy nature. He becomes unholy for not fulfilling his responsibility to deal
with the possibility he was responsible for bringing about.</span></p>
