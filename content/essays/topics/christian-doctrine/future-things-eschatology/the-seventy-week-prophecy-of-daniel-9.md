style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>) in <b>9</b>:25 is parallel to <i>“the

Joshua <b>1</b>:13; 1 Chronicles <b>26</b>:32; Esther <b>1</b>:19, <i>etc</i>.)
In <b>9</b>:23 there may be another reference to the same thing in the
expression “consider the commandment” (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>בִּין בַּדָּבָר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>), although usually the word </span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>דָּבָר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>is translated “matter” or some other indefinite way
here. Gabriel may be telling Daniel to understand the outworking of this word
of God that has been decreed (<b>9</b>:24) on Israel and Jerusalem. The vision
(</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>מַרְאָה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>) of <b>9</b>:23b
is then in reference to the whole of <b>9</b>:24-27. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            While it may be possible to
understand the word/commandment of <b>9</b>:25 without any reference elsewhere,
it seems necessary to connect it with <b>9</b>:23 in order to obtain a
satisfactory meaning for the latter, unless we say that the word/command of <b>9</b>:23
is God’s “word” to Gabriel telling him to go to inform Daniel of these things. Even
so, it would still include the command in<b> 9</b>:25.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B.  Beginning “the commandment” with “about
the first year of Darius” maintains a chronological connection and continuity
with the seventy years of captivity prophesied by Jeremiah (Jeremiah <b>25</b>:11-12;
<b>29</b>:10; 2 Chronicles <b>36</b>:21; Ezra<b> 1</b>:1; cp. Zechariah <b>7</b>:5).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        A close association must be
kept between <b>9</b>:24-27, 20-23, 3-19, and 1-2. The prophecy in 24-27 falls
back on the preceding section since 24-27 is the communication that Gabriel
came to give in <b>9</b>:21-23; <b>9</b>:20 unites with <b>9</b>:3-19 since <b>9</b>:20
summarizes the prayer recorded in those earlier verses. That summary is
twofold, mentioning “the sin of <u>my people</u> Israel” and “the <u>holy
mountain</u> of <u>my</u> God.” There is an association also with<b> 9</b>:24: the
decree “on <u>your people</u>” and “on <u>your holy city</u>.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        It was because of Jeremiah’s
prophecy about the seventy years of captivity that Daniel prayed the subsequent
prayer (<b>9</b>:1-2). Daniel being carried away in the 605 B.C. captivity, the
seventy-year period had almost ended when he offered that prayer (538 B.C.). If
the seventy weeks/hebdomads begin immediately at the end of the seventy years
of captivity, God is taking up the future of Daniel’s people where the end of
Jeremiah’s seventy-year prediction had left them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. The end of the first seven “weeks” is the
rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem (445 B.C.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  The total of seventy hebdomads is
comprised of 7 + 62 + 1. Daniel <b>9</b>:26 says that after the <u>sixty-two</u>
hebdomads Messiah will be cut off. Since <b>9</b>:25 says that the time to
Messiah Prince is seven plus sixty-two, the <u>end</u> of the seven hebdomads
must be the completion of the building of Jerusalem, its streets, and “moat/ditch”
mentioned in<b> 9</b>:25b. </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>חָרוּץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span> (from </span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>חָרַץ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>, to cut) originally signified
the protective ditch or trench around a fortified city. Here it may refer to
the “wall” of Jerusalem since the Septuagint translates it </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>τεῖχος</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Such
an understanding fits with the fact that the building of the walls was in
“troublesome times” (Nehemiah <b>4</b>:13, 16-21).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B.  That the first seven hebdomads refer
to the period of restoring Jerusalem comes also from the fact that the
word/commandment at the <u>beginning</u> had to do with the reconstruction of
Jerusalem. The going forth of the command to restore the city (<b>9</b>:25a) is
to be connected, then, with the building of the wall (<b>9</b>:25c) as the
beginning and end of one well-defined period of time, a period significant
enough to the subsequent history of Israel to make that period an integral part
of a prophecy about Israel’s future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> III. The middle of the final “week” is the death of
Messiah (A.D. 30).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  After the sixty-nine hebdomads (7 +
62), the Anointed One would be cut off and have nothing, perhaps in comparison
with the material emphasis of the first section of the seventy weeks. At least
the death of Messiah would be a failure in the eyes of an Israelite nationalist
who looked for a political Messiah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Although <b>9</b>:26 merely says <u>after</u>
the sixty-nine hebdomands, it is understood here to be <u>in the middle of</u>
the <u>seventieth week</u> on the basis of <b>9</b>:27a. Even as <b>9</b>:25a
parallels <b>9</b>:25c with <b>9</b>:25b intervening, so <b>9</b>:26a parallels
<b>9</b>:27a with <b>9</b>:26b intervening in parallel to <b>9</b>:27b. The <u>he</u>
who makes the firm covenant is identified especially by dispensationalists with
the prince whose people will come and destroy the city in<b> 9</b>:26b that was
rebuilt in <b>9</b>:25c. Since that <u>prince</u> is grammatically subordinate
in<b> 9</b>:26b, it is best to take <i>he</i> in reference to the Anointed One
of<b> 9</b>:26a. As a result, the ceasing of the sacrifices and oblations of <b>9</b>:26a
is with respect to the divine requirement of them as the obedience on which
God’s forgiveness of sins was conditioned. Therefore, their ceasing here is
with respect to the <u>basis</u> of their ceasing even as the everlasting
righteousness in <b>9</b>:24 refers to the <u>basis</u>, not the fact, of
everlasting righteousness. The middle of the hebdomad is the crucifixion; the
beginning is Messiah’s birth (or conceivably the beginning of his ministry);
the end is the destruction of Jerusalem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>IV. The end of the seventy weeks is the destruction of
Jerusalem (A.D. 70).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  Presumably whatever is mentioned under
the caption of the seventy hebdomads takes place during the time of the seventy
hebdomads. The culminating event mentioned in <b>9</b>:24-27 is the “desolation”
(<b>9</b>:26b) and “full end” (<b>9</b>:27b) of the city rebuilt in <b>9</b>:25a
+ c. The destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70 by the people
(Romans) of the prince (Titus) is a fully satisfactory fulfillment of this
prediction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        As an aside, it is interesting
to note that it is the <u>people of the prince</u> who destroy the sanctuary. Titus
himself gave order that the sanctuary was not to be burned, but it was burned
nevertheless by the soldiers (Josephus, <i>Wars</i> 6:4:5). Josephus’ comment
is also interesting:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“But, as for that house, God had for certain long ago
doomed it to the fire; and now that fatal day was come, according to the
revolution of the ages: it was the tenth day of the month Lous [Ab], upon which
it was formerly burned by the king of Babylon.”</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>This culminating destruction occurred at the end of
the same hebdomad in the midst of which Messiah was cut off. “Full end” (</span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>כָּלָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>) is most appropriately applied
to the “final end” of Israel as a nation, which occurred in A.D. 70. At that
time there ceased <u>historically</u> (Hebrews <b>8</b>:13) the sacrifices that
ceased <u>theoretically</u> at Messiah’s death (Colossians <b>2</b>:13-15). The
“full end” mentioned in Isaiah <b>10</b>:23 may also refer to the Roman
destruction, because the preceding text is speaking of a remnant returned from
captivity (although E. J. Young <i>in loco</i> identifies “full end” with the
final judgment, while others associate it with the fall of Judah in 586 B.C.). “Full
end” in both passages is combined with its being “determined” (</span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>כָּלָה וְנֶחֱרָצָה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>). Since
there is an <u>end</u> mentioned in <b>9</b>:24-27, it is presumably that end
of which the building of Jerusalem is the <u>beginning</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B.  An atmosphere of completeness pervades
the whole of the passage: the making of an end of sin, the sealing up of
prophecy, and perhaps even the use of <u>hebdomads</u> to emphasize a
seventyfold completeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Lamech said, <i>“If Cain will
be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold”</i> (Genesis<b> 4</b>:24).
Evidently this latter passage is the basis for Jesus’ statement to Peter in
Matthew <b>18</b>:22, <i>“I do not say to you ‘until seven times,’ but ‘until
seventy-seven times,’” </i>reversing vengeance by forgiveness. The kinship
between Genesis<b> 4</b>:24 and Matthew <b>18</b>:22 is clear since the numbers
in the Septuagint of Genesis are the same as Matthew but not like Daniel (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐβδομηκοντάκις</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἑπτά</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>contrasted
to </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἑβδομήκοντα</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἑβδομάδες</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> respectively. The former is best taken in the Greek
as seventy-seven times and the latter as seventy times seven, though the
distinction is often blurred in English versions). God’s vengeance on Israel came
when he had forgiven them “seventy times seven,” because they did not repent
(Matthew <b>18</b>:22 + Luke <b>17</b>:3-4).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Certain significant objections may
be raised to the above construction of Daniel’s seventy hebdomads. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            I. The most basic matter is the necessity
of understanding <u>seventy hebdomads</u> figuratively, or symbolically, in a
passage that is ostensibly rather literal otherwise. </span><span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>שָּׁבֻעִים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>is commonly interpreted to mean seventy <u>weeks</u>
of “days,” which stand for “years.” As a result, a period of 490 years would be
meant, an insufficient number to cover the 607 years from 538 B.C. to A.D. 70. If
we begin with 458 B.C. with Cyrus’ decree, an interesting arrangement can be
made in which the end of the sixty-ninth week is A.D. 26, the time of the
Anointed One’s anointing with the Holy Spirit (cp. Acts <b>10</b>:38) so that
his being cut off is in the midst of the seventieth week (A.D. 30).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  While this arrangement with literal <u>years</u>
can obtain significant results at two points (anointing and cutting off), it
seems deficient at the other two points. (1) the end of the seven hebdomands
(49 years after 458 B.C.) would be 409 B.C., a year that does not seem
historically, and therefore prophetically, significant. (2) The end of the
seventy hebdomads comes at A.D. 33, the time of Stephen’s martyrdom and the
conversion of the Gentile missionary Paul. (The conversion of Cornelius, the
first Gentile, may be a better choice than Stephen’s martyrdom if indeed he was
converted that same year.) While the goal of the seventy hebdomads as stated in
Daniel <b>9</b>:24 is admittedly spiritual, the events of about A.D. 33 seem to
be no more spiritually significant than, say, the beginning of Paul’s first
missionary journey to the Gentiles. The completion of the wall of Jerusalem in
445 B.C. is a better alternative for the former of these two weaknesses, and
the destruction of Jerusalem is better in the later instance, both events
marking significant political and spiritual terminations of well-defined
periods of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  With respect to the A.D. 26 date, it
may be worth noting that the end of the sixty-ninth hebdomad is said to be, not
the anointing of the Anointed, but the Anointed himself. The reference could as
easily be to his birth as to his presentation to Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Since the whole of Daniel <b>9</b>
grows out of Jeremiah’s prophecy regarding seventy years of captivity, seventy
hebdomads may be based on the Jeremiah number proportionately expanded by </span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>שָׁבוּעַ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>, that is, the completion of
Daniel’s nation and city was to be seven times as long as the duration of their
captivity. There were waves of captivity and waves of return so that a definite
period of time is difficult to attach to the captivity; hence, <u>seventy</u>
itself is a round number standing for the captivity that lasted in its extremes
from 605 to 444 B. C., or 139 years (twice 70). Seventy years is as close to
the number of years of captivity as seven times seventy is for the subsequent
history of the nation (607 years).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  As for the traditional view, on the
other hand, it seems unlikely that a decree on Jerusalem and Israel should
include all but the last thirty-seven years of the nation, especially when that
end is mentioned under the caption of the seventy hebdomads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2.   Perhaps a more important objection
lies in breaking down the seventy into parts: 7 + </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  62 + 1. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Seven as a number of completeness <i>“is
not based on the sum of any of its factors or any other arithmetical feature of
the number, but is </i>usus loquendi<i>”</i> (John J. Davis, <i>Biblical
Numerology</i>, p. 119). One response to this objection is that the total
number is in fact “broken down” in the prophecy itself. Furthermore, a
significant period of rebuilding the city and the sanctuary comes at the
beginning while another period of consummation and destruction comes at the
end. When the seven hebdomads representing the former are taken from the
beginning and the one hebdomad representing the latter is taken from the end,
there remains a central portion proportionately much larger than either of
them, which is designated by the remainder—sixty-two. Therefore, the last week
is comparatively large, because it has several <u>important</u> elements. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  It is to be observed that according
to the text Messiah comes at the end of sixty-two, not sixty-nine. Daniel does
not add sixty-two to seven as if to say that the seven is part of the
sixty-nine and therefore of the same category as the whole. He keeps them
separate and makes them grammatically definite (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-size:14.0pt'>שָׁבֻעִים שִׁבְעָה וְשָׁבִים שִׁשִּׁים וּשְּׁנַיִם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>) as if to
signal their independence from the former seven (<b>9</b>:25a; <b>9</b>:26a). Furthermore,
the seven weeks are not only mentioned separately, but put first as if to imply
that they precede the sixty-two. With reference to this non-symbolic number
sixty-two, we may also note that 62 x 7 = 434 years, which is only about five
years off from Messiah’s birth calculated from 445 B.C. Consequently, sixty-two
is proportionately appropriate to the long segment that intervenes between the
first seven weeks and the last one week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Perhaps the reason <u>seven</u>
hebdomads represent the first period of return and reconstruction (538-445 B.C.
= 72 years) while <u>one</u> represents the last period of consummation and
destruction (4/6? B.C. to A.D. 70 = 75 years) is that the former was viewed as
a less unified period than the period of the Messiah’s preparation and
presentation, and the church’s establishment and initial spread. It was also
closer at hand, which would make it appear larger to the forward-looking eye
than the remote period of time that would close out the history of Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The basic question underlying these
two objections is whether the intended meaning of the numbers is figurative or
literal. Is there any clear example of biblical apocalyptic where days or
numbers stand for the exact number of years between future events? Isaiah <b>7</b>:8
and <b>23</b>:15-17 come close, but the number is not a number of days that
represent years. Is not this very idea open to question?</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Although the preceding analysis of
the prophecy is somewhat open to question, other arrangements are probably more
so. The strength of the above presentation lies in the importance of <u>each</u>
terminal point in the series as ending some definite, well-defined period of
history quite appropriate to the information given in the text. Its possible
weakness lies in the relationship of these periods to the numbers the text
assigns to them.</span></p>
