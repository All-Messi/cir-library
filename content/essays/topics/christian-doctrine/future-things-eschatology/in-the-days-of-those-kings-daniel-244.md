kings</i> [</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>מ</span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt'>ֶלֶךְ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>] seems to refer to the preceding
four <u>kingdoms</u> [</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>מַלְכוּ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>] of <b>2</b>:38-43.
Daniel uses <i>kingdom</i> and <i>king</i> somewhat interchangeably in that <i>king</i>
can by metonymy stand for the realm he rules, even though over a period of time
there may be several kings in one kingdom. In <b>2</b>:39 the writer says, <i>“And
after <u>you</u>, Nebuchadnezzar, will arise <u>another kingdom</u> inferior to
<u>you</u>.”</i> A similar shift of terms comes in <b>2</b>:44, <i>“In the days
of those <u>kings</u> the God of heaven will set up a kingdom . . . it will
break all these <u>kingdoms</u> in pieces and consume (them).”</i> Later in <b>7</b>:17
the four beasts from the sea (<b>7</b>:3; earth, <b>7</b>:17) are said to
represent four <u>kings</u>, whereas <b>7</b>:23 says that <i>“the fourth beast
will be a fourth <u>kingdom</u> that will be different from all the <u>kingdoms</u>.”
</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  As a result, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>we</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
need not suppose that <u>those kings</u> of <b>2</b>:44 means the toes of the
image described in <b>2</b>:40-43. Some commentators have identified these toes
as kings answering to the ten horns of the non-descript beast in chapter <b>7</b>,
but the context of <b>2</b>:44 does not so identify them. We would expect the
references of <b>2</b>:44 to be used by the writer in terms of the passage he
is now writing. We must not allegorize a symbol beyond its intended
representation, especially when an interpretation is given, as in this case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We may ask how it can
be that the fifth kingdom in <b>2</b>:44 can be set up at a <u>particular time</u>
in the days of four <u>successive</u> kingdoms. The answer is that, in the
historical development referred to, a continuity of territory existed. Each
succeeding kingdom includes the preceding one (cf. <b>7</b>:12): Rome, Greece,
Medo-Persia, Babylon. Furthermore, as will be shown later, all these kingdoms
have the common characteristic of being a replacement for divine rule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  If this identification
of the four kingdoms is correct, then the fifth kingdom was to be set up “in
the days of” the Roman Empire, the fourth kingdom, which included territorially
(at least in part) the kingdoms that preceded it and with which it was
historically continuous. The text says “in the days of” (</span><span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt'>בְּיוֹמֵיהוֹן דִּי</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>), not “after” (</span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt'>בָּתַר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>, cp. <b>2</b>:39), which does
not allow for an indefinite lapse of time to intervene. Not only is the establishment
of this kingdom “in the days of” the Roman Empire, but it is “in the days of
those kingdom<u>s</u>” (= “kings”; see ¶1) considered as a unit. The idea that
the kingdom will yet be established in a <u>revived</u> Roman Empire does not
seem to fit the historical continuity that was to exist between those <u>kingdoms</u>
that preceded it and <u>in</u> the days of which the fifth kingdom would be
established. If the kingdom<u>s</u> possess a historical and geographical <u>unity</u>,
the text does not accommodate easily the <u>discontinuity</u> introduced by the
concept of revival. In the case of a Roman Empire, revival would have to mean
bringing back what has historically passed from the scene, because there is
today no Roman Empire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The basically
spiritual character of the fifth kingdom is implicit in the fact that the God
of heaven will set it up (<b>2</b>:44), that it is a stone cut out without
hands (<b>2</b>:34), that it will be given to the saints of the Most High (<b>2</b>:27),
and even in the fact that it is eternal (<b>2</b>:44<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span>; <b>7</b>:27). While the other kingdoms arise from the
sea, or the earth (<b>7</b>:3, 17), that is, from among men (sea = people; cp.
Revelation <b>17</b>:15), the fifth kingdom breaks into human history from the
outside. Since it is divine, it is basically spiritual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Although the text says
the kingdom will be <u>set up</u> in the days of these kings (<b>2</b>:44a), it
does not say that kingdom will <u>complete its breaking in pieces and consuming</u>
in the days of these kings (<b>2</b>:44b). A rough parallel may be found in the
constitution of Israel as a nation and in its conquest of Canaan. Israel was
formally <u>identified</u> as a nation at the crossing of the Red Sea (1
Corinthians<b> 10</b>:2) and formally <u>constituted</u> as a nation at Sinai,
but it did not even begin to <u>conquer</u> its land for another generation and
did not fully do so for nearly five hundred years. Likewise, the fifth kingdom
may be viewed as <u>constituted</u> in the days of the Roman Empire without
necessarily saying that its <u>conquests</u> are <u>completed</u> then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The fifth kingdom is
basically spiritual, but it does not simply pervade or fill previously existing
entities with new dynamic. It replaces them. They are to be broken and carried
away as by a wind like the chaff of the summer threshing floor, so no place was
found for them (<b>2</b>:35) forever (<b>2</b>:44; <b>7</b>:14). It is
therefore the functional equivalent of them, wholly diverse from them, and
fully in place of them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  As a result of the
fact that the fifth kingdom is basically a spiritual entity as well as a
replacement for its predecessors, there may be at least two stages to the
progressive completion of the conquest it carries out: (1) the stage in which
it was against the ideology common to the other kingdoms, and (2) the time when
these kingdoms are replaced by what is antithetical to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In light of this
two-stage aspect of the fifth kingdom’s full establishment, we should note that
it is constituted “in the days of” the Roman Empire, but its full conquest is
not said to be completed then; it only destroys them without mentioning the
mode or the time. We conclude that it was <u>constituted</u> in the days of
Rome and began its spiritual conquests at that time. Full conquest by this
spiritual kingdom, however, will not occur until the Son of David fully reveals
himself at his second advent. The pattern is similar to physical Israel, which did
not complete its conquests until several hundred years after its constitution. The
first David finally conquered the Canaanites whose land had already been given
in promise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  It may be added
parenthetically that in the days of the millennial kingdom there may be those </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>who are conquered</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> but not completely converted by the spiritual reign
of David’s Son, even as there remained Canaanites who were reduced to tribute
but not eradicated, even at the time of David. These people who only give a
“tribute” of lip service during the millennium, while they are without a leader
(Revelation <b>20</b>:3), will rise up at the loosing of Satan to commit
insurrection against the kingdom and will be summarily destroyed (Revelation<b>
20</b>:7-10) in much the same way as Sennacherib’s army was wiped out in the
days of Isaiah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The fifth kingdom may
therefore be viewed as the reign of God initially constituted in the
first-century establishment of the church. Since the kingdom of God is
basically spiritual, its warfare is spiritual, not military. But this spiritual
warfare will not fully conquer until the Lord reveals himself at his second
coming, at which time he will fully establish a spiritual kingdom. It will be a
spiritual, not a political, kingdom, because what he establishes is not only
antithetical to the ideology of previous kingdoms, but completely replaces
their <u>kind</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The fifth kingdom was
constituted in the days of the fourth kingdom and began its conquest then (A.D.
30). It will yet eventually conquer the Roman Empire of the first century in
the sense that it will finish later what it began then. It did not begin a
political conquest, but a conquest of an ideology—the system of human
jurisprudence—that was inherited from the head of gold, the heart of silver, and
the trunk of brass, and was bequeathed to those kingdoms that succeeded it. The
stone of Daniel<b> 2</b>:34-35, 44-45 does not break in pieces the Roman Empire
<u>as such</u>, because it does not break in pieces the iron-clay legs-feet <u>alone</u>.
It breaks the whole image in pieces: gold, silver, brass, iron and clay (<b>2</b>:35,
45). When the stone strikes the image, it strikes at the feet indeed (<b>2</b>:34),
but the <u>whole image falls</u>—the whole with which the Roman Empire is
considered a part: (1) <i>“in the days of those king<u>s,</u>”</i> (2) <i>“it
will break all these kingdom<u>s</u> in pieces and consume (them)” </i>(<b>2</b>:44).
Historically speaking, the first three kings-kingdoms had passed from the
scene, but they all are said to be conquered (rather begun to be conquered) at
the same time in history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The image therefore
represents <u>two</u> things: (1) the historical succession of four empires,
but more importantly (2) a unitary substitute for divine rule. It is a <u>single</u>
image “embodying” <u>four</u> members. In short, this golden-headed image in
chapter <b>2</b> represents the same sort of thing as the golden image of
chapter <b>3</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  “In the days of these
kingdoms” typical of all human kingdoms, God initiated a new kind of rule that
he will cause eventually to replace them. No longer will the misused iron rule
God gave man (cp. Romans <b>13</b>:1ff.) be mingled with the voice of popular
opinion (Daniel <b>2</b>:43). God will fully establish a just rule in which he
alone will direct the affairs of his eternal kingdom.</span></p>
