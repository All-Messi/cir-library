<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Theology establishes the
context for liberal arts. It is the discipline of the whole, the discipline of
the ultimate. It addresses what is original, eternal, central, basic, ultimate,
and all-inclusive. As such, theology affirms first that reality is <u>cohesive</u>
rather than chaotic—that the parts have a whole to be part of. Theology calls
for “centeredness” and centers reality in the Creator rather than the creation
and in the Teacher rather than the student. By implication, theology
contextualizes all other disciplines as sub-disciplines, integrates them into
one whole, relates them to each another, limits their province, and critiques
their methods and findings in at least a restrictive sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christian theology affirms
second that the whole is to be <u>personalized</u> because the ultimate Reality
is personal. Beginning with the doctrine of creation, special revelation
indicates that the impersonal derives from the personal, not <i>vice versa</i>
as in atheistic evolutionary thought. The personal God created for his purpose,
so the impersonal has worth and meaning relative to his purpose. As a result,
the impersonal universe takes on a quality beyond what it would otherwise have,
a quality somewhat like the one that distinguishes a grandmother’s handmade
quilt from a machine-made blanket at Wal-Mart: <i>“Something shines in every
hue Christless eyes have never seen.”</i> The whole is personalized, not
personified or depersonalized, because its manner of origin determines its
nature. The natural sciences are impacted accordingly. The doctrine of creation
teaches also that human persons are created in the image of the divine Person. Our
implicit dignity and purpose affects all disciplines that have people as their
subject and object—the arts and the social sciences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Theology limits and
qualifies the other disciplines. The triune God is interpersonal being, so that
interpersonalism is the integrating reality in the Christian worldview and the
foundational truth in education and educational practice. Those who teach
theology assume responsibility for understanding and articulating revealed
truth in connection with human experience and the pursuit of all knowledge
based on it.</span></p>
