style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Christian
churches began as an effort to foster <u>Christian unity</u> by returning to
scripture alone for the operation of the body of Christ and by setting aside
items that have crept into Christendom from outside the New Testament. The
conviction has been that division arose in part from such extras. But creating
unity requires more than getting rid of what causes division; it also requires
what Christ’s people must stand for. Below are characteristic beliefs and
practices associated with these churches generally, though certainly not with
them only.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Scripture</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Scripture
alone provides the basis for Christian unity. That conviction sets aside
tradition, creeds, continued special revelation, and additional normative
writings beyond the thirty-nine Old Testament writings and twenty-seven New
Testament books accepted everywhere (catholicity) as written by apostles and
extensions of their office (apostolicity) and proclaiming a common message
(orthodoxy). God has preserved scripture adequately for faith and good works
relative to his expectancy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Deity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
God of the Bible is unique and personal with <u>interpersonal</u>
characteristics: love (1 John<b> 4</b>:8), grace, holiness (Leviticus <b>11</b>:44,
<i>etc</i>.), self-consistency (immutability; Malachi <b>3</b>:6; James <b>1</b>:17),
and perfection (Isaiah <b>40</b>:28). His <u>natural</u> characteristics make
him self-existent (aseity; Exodus <b>3</b>:13-15), sovereign, eternal (Psalm <b>106</b>:48),
spiritual (John <b>4</b>:24), unperceivable (1 Timothy <b>1</b>:17; <b>6</b>:16),
able to do everything consistent with his nature and purpose (omnipotent; Psalm
<b>115</b>:3), all-knowing (omniscient; Psalm <b>147</b>:5), and omnipresent
(at least by virtue of omniscience; Psalm <b>139</b>:1-123).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
the Christian understanding, deity consists of Father-Son-Spirit only, uniquely,
equally, and always. “They” are one interpersonally, “corporately” and in
nature, unity, distinctness, and purpose with an internal order in which the
Father sends the Son and the Spirit. They are distinguishable before, during,
and after time sufficiently for the Son to be <u>with</u> the Father before
time (John <b>1</b>:1; <b>17</b>:24, <i>etc.</i>); for the Son to <u>pray</u>
to the Father, the Father to <u>send</u> the Spirit, and the Spirit to be <u>another</u>
Comforter from the Son during time (John<b> 14</b>:16); and for the Son to sit
on the right hand of the Father after incarnation. Messiah is called deity
(Hebrews <b>1</b>:3, 8; John 1:1, <i>etc</i>.) and the Spirit appears with the
Father and Son in “trinitarian passages” like Matthew <b>28</b>:19.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Creation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            God spoke the
universe into existence from nothing. Distinct from its creator, it exists for
his purposes till he replaces it with something even better (Matthew <b>24</b>:29-31;
2 Peter<b> 3</b>:10-13). He built it to be self-perpetuating with limitations
that preserve his sovereignty over it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Mankind</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            God created
mankind in his own image for fellowship with him and to bear responsibility for
the place in creation where humans reside (Genesis<b> 1</b>:26-28). He did so,
not out of need (Acts <b>17</b>:25), but out of delight and that on whom he
could bestow himself. The image clusters abilities that comprise the
interpersonal capacity unique in this creation. He created one man and one
woman for lifelong relationship in marriage, instituted the home as the context
for multiplying and populating the earth, and gave men final responsibility to
God for the home and his people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Evil and Sin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Out
of consideration for human need, God has built a world appropriate to the human
condition. He constituted mankind and his environment with features that take
into account the capacity for sin. That ability derives from the interpersonal
capacity of mind activated by will, which can choose contrary to divine intent,
especially given each person’s viewpoint of consciousness and the presence of
social temptation directed at pervertible psychological desires and physical
drives. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Before
the foundation of the world, God foreknew that eventuation and made provision
for dealing with it: (1) he established the <u>limitation</u> of death and
those things that lead to and accompany it, planned (2) periodic future
intervention to redirect errant history, and (e) pre-arranged the possibility
of <u>redemption</u> from alienation through the work of the Son (Ephesians <b>1</b>:3-14;
1 Peter<b> 1</b>:17-20). God created natural “evil” to keep mankind from
assuming autonomy, and temporarily allows limited social evil, which enables
people to develop a higher degree and kind of goodness than could exist in an
ideal world without restraints and no temptation to resist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Christ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Jesus
of Nazareth fulfilled the Messianic prediction in the Jewish scriptures. He was
born of a virgin, proclaimed with miraculous confirmation the coming of the
Messianic kingdom, the church; was crucified under Pontius Pilate; resurrected
the third day as paramount proof of his Messiahship, and bodily ascended to the
Father after appearing to many disciples following his empty-tomb resurrection (1
Corinthians <b>15</b>:1-15 and elsewhere).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The Son
pre-existed his incarnation, the time when he “emptied” himself of the free
exercise of his prerogatives as deity (Philippians<b> 2</b>:5-8). He ever lives
now to intercede for his people (Hebrews<b> 7</b>:25) so that they need nothing
more for establishing and maintaining eternal salvation. At the appropriate
time, he will personally return at the Father’s behest with angels in concert
to gather from the whole world those who have owned him as Lord and Savior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Salvation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            All
salvation is figured relative only to Jesus Christ regardless of dispensation:
patriarchal (1 Peter <b>3</b>:18-22;<b> 4</b>:6), Mosaic (Hebrews <b>9</b>:15),
or Christian (Acts <b>4</b>:12). So, Christianity is an exclusive religion as a
total worldview regardless of what individual truths other religions may also contain.
By personal identification with Christ (being “in Christ”), God regards people
as righteous like Christ and so in fellowship with him and other Christians.
That salvation is open to everyone, because God does not want anyone to perish (2
Peter <b>3</b>:9).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Salvation
is reconciliation from the alienation caused by personal sin (Romans<b> 5</b>:10-11;
2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:18-19; Ephesians <b>2</b>:14-18; Colossians <b>1</b>:19-23).
<u>Alienation</u> is personal because <u>guilt</u> is personal (Ezekiel <b>18</b>:19-20)
and <u>sin</u> is an act personally done. God does not consider people guilty
to lostness because of the sin of others, including our first parents. As a
result, both the nature of mankind and the nature of salvation operate the same
for us as for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            None
can save themselves because the perfection standard, once broken, cannot be
re-achieved. Furthermore, salvation is reconciliation between God and estranged
persons. The grace to restore relationship always rests with the one sinned
against. People are reconciled by faith, that is, by trusting that the Other will
forgive through Christ as that basis for us as righteous who have committed
ourselves to him. People must respond to God, but their response does not save
them (<u>cause</u>); it meets the <u>condition</u> for his saving them—for
considering them righteous unto renewed fellowship with him. The essence of
their response is identification with Christ, the Righteous One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Baptism
is believers’ immersion, an act by which a person makes a statement
(performative act) that expresses willingness to identify with Christ as savior
and Lord totally, permanently, and exclusively—to enter “into Christ.” Based on
that identity with Christ, God forgives sin, gives the “indwelling” presence of
his Spirit, and counts a person part of the body of Christ (Acts<b> 2</b>:38).
So baptism pertains to the salvation process, not as an effectual work, but as
an act of trust and commitment; it is more than a testimony to others or a rite
for becoming a member of the institutional church. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
maintaining commitment to him, his disciples trust that he continues to be
Savior from occasional sin (1 John <b>1</b>:6-10) and Lord of daily living.
Salvation as reconciliation by grace creates an ongoing relationship that
appropriate attitude and motives do not presume upon lest they bring renewed
alienation on themselves (Hebrews <b>6</b>:4-8; <b>10</b>:37-39, and similar
warnings).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Lord’s Supper</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The Lord’s
Supper is part of regular Christian worship on the first day of the week (1
Corinthians <b>11</b>:20 + <b>16</b>:2). It is an ordinance of remembrance in
which unleavened bread and grape juice serve as emblems of the Lord’s body and
blood. They represent a reality beyond themselves rather than become that
referent in whole or in part (impanation). They call to mind Christ’s
culminating act of ministry to mankind in expression of obedience to the
Father. In that remembrance his people commit to do likewise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Holy Spirit</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
Holy Spirit is a person of deity present with God’s people in Christ (John <b>16</b>:7),
real but not perceivable (1 Timothy<b> 6</b>:16). In his normal mode of
operation, he guides, empowers, intercedes, and unites indirectly through the
word, circumstance, and other Christians, as well as “directly” by an awareness
of his real, imperceptible presence (1 Timothy <b>6</b>:16; cp. Ephesians <b>3</b>:17;
Judges <b>16</b>:20).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            While
believing in God’s supernatural intervention into history and in answered
prayer, Christians do not typically expect current miraculous manifestation.
Claims to that effect call for applying tests (1 John<b> 4</b>:1-4) according
to the ancient formula (Deuteronomy <b>18</b>:20-23); Galatians <b>1</b>:6-10).
Consequently, churches do not believe in <u>speaking in languages</u> as a
typical or necessary manifestation of acceptance by God although they would not
make it a test of fellowship unless practitioners become disorderly and
divisive with it or make it a required sign of genuine conversion. Languages
are real languages (xenoglossia) rather than non-language expression
(glossolalia) or ecstatic utterance. Healing is understood as granted through
prayer according to God’s choosing; hence, <u>miraculous healing</u> through an
individual’s supernatural gifting is considered unlikely. Lest he “speak
presumptuously,” the claimant himself must be able to distinguish <u>special
divine revelation</u> from ideas that typically come into people’s minds as
natural experiences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Covenants</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Christians
live under the New Covenant that Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34 prophesied and
Hebrews <b>8 </b>discusses. As such, it is <u>another covenant</u> from the
Mosaic covenant and a <u>new kind of covenant</u>, one that operates from within
through the heart. Christians, then, follow only by those directives for
worship, service, and Christian living that appear in New Testament writings that
address the body of Christ. Matters whereon they do not speak are matters of
freedom in living and worship as long as they do not contradict express
command, apostolic precedent, or necessary inference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Church</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            As
part of the “free church” tradition, churches believe the church was
established on the next Pentecost after Christ’s ascension and continues to
exist in general society separate from national governments; the kingdom no
longer has a national component as it did during the Mosaic dispensation. It is
an interpersonal system that is not located here or there (Luke <b>17</b>:20-21)
but exists between people defined and held together by loving, godly behavior
rather than by geography, race, nationality, societal or marital status (1
Corinthians <b>7</b>:20), or characterized by irrelevant non-interpersonal variants
like dress or diet (1 Corinthians <b>8</b>:8; 11:16; Galatians <b>3</b>:28). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Christians
believe that the organization of the church in the New Testament was meant to
be permanent; hence, the general authoritative offices consist of the <u>Lord</u>
himself and the original <u>apostles</u> (without successors); general,
non-authoritative work of <u>evangelists</u>; and the local authoritative
office of <u>elder-bishop-pastor-teacher</u> (Titus <b>1</b>:5 + 7; Acts <b>20</b>:17
+ 28; cp. Ephesians <b>4</b>:11), assisted by non-authoritative <u>deacons</u>.
Additional elements of local organization are matters of judgment as guided by
propriety and expediency or can be considered aspects of the deacons’ role. No
territorial slots of organization exist between the local congregation and the
original universal apostles as represented today through their written
testimony in the New Testament only. Evangelists continue to serve at large by
godly influence, not legal authority, and can do so in local settings—as
“ministers”—at the pleasure of the local church. As a result, churches practice
local autonomy, operating as much as possible by the influence of love under the
ordering responsibility of multiple elders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The church
proclaims God’s grace rather than authoritatively channels it. Since the grace
of salvation and blessing are interpersonal matters, it flows directly from God
to each person, and each person by prayer has direct access to the Father in
the name of Christ, the only mediator (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:5). Likewise, the church
proclaims the message it has received rather than assumes the right to add to,
change, or demand adherence to it. The minimal organization among believers
exists only for good order in fulfilling responsibility in corporate worship,
fellowship, and outreach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Evangelism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
body of Christ consists of people in personal relationship with God through
Christ alone—the safe and saved. Since salvation is reconciliation, it comes
about by interpersonal means—<u>grace</u> by him who reconciles and <u>faith</u>
by those reconciled. So the church spreads by interpersonal means as expressed
in the Great Commission. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Christ’s Commission
calls for <u>influencing</u> through teaching about reconciliation. By its very
nature, reconciliation cannot come by force or the authority of third parties.
The Commission is not a military mandate or a legal operation, because the
process of inclusion must fit with the nature and purpose of what it advances:
it must be interpersonal (proclamation) to bring about interpersonal
consequence (reconciliation). So, to the <u>church</u> God has assigned the
responsibility for teaching how people should relate to each other under God.
To human <u>government</u> he has assigned the restrictive responsibility of
protecting people from those who would harm others (Romans <b>13</b>:1-7).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Matters of Discretion</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Inasmuch
as all Christians are compassed about by infirmity, they are subject to “blessed
inconsistency” and human frailty. Consequently, patience addressed toward right
attitudes and motives becomes a starting point for relationship, working
outward from a center of love and faithfulness to the person of Christ. All
things equally true are not equally important. Church organization and
eschatological understandings, say, are not as central as salvation and
Christian living. The desire to develop as much common ground as possible leads
toward the whole of sound doctrine and the maturity of godly living
(Philippians<b> 3</b>:12-16).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
light of that mentality, Christ’s followers extend respect and encouragement to
each other even on some of the matters enumerated above, while aspiring to
teach and learn the way of the Lord perfectly (Acts <b>18</b>:26).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            For
purposes of Christian unity, churches try to stand above age-long theological
controversies about <u>matters without behavioral correlates</u> (what does not
affect Christian living and mission), all the while affirming in principle the
truthfulness of all matters whereof scripture speaks. That approach is
especially important in regard to <u>matters of mystery</u> (beyond human
ability to understand) or <u>matters of partial revelation</u> (those addressed
only in general terms).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Among
such issues stand a precise understanding of the <u>trinity</u> beyond the fact
that Father-Son-Spirit are <u>one</u> in interpersonal nature and eternal
purpose while sufficiently <u>distinguishable</u> to allow for personal
interaction (John <b>14</b>:16).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Similarly,
the precise understanding of the <u>creation</u> accounts in Genesis calls for
flexibility, especially beyond the fact that the universe is not eternal, that
it is distinct from God who created it from nothing, and that it is destined to
destruction from fervent heat as meant in 2 Peter <b>3</b>:10-13.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Christians
encourage fellow Christians to hold in abeyance expectancies about the
predicted <u>end-time events</u> lest they be as inaccurate about them as many
Jews were about Messiah’s first coming and the nature of his work and kingdom.
While affirming the personal, visible, universal return of the Lord at an
unknowable future time (Matthew <b>24</b>:36), they consider somewhat unclear
the nature and relative timing of “the rapture,” the great tribulation, a
millennium, the resurrection of the righteous and the wicked, and the nature of
the conscious eternal state of the lost. Prophecy is understood as given to
engender hope more than to write history ahead of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
same goes for <u>theories of the atonement</u> beyond the fact that all
salvation is figured relative to Jesus Messiah alone. Identity with him gives access
to whatever way the Father views Christ’s nature and work for considering
people righteous unto renewed fellowship with him and each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Theories
of inspiration</u> are considered matters of personal persuasion as long as the
examples of revelation in scripture can be affirmed and as long as the
resulting revelation and its preservation suffice to thoroughly furnish God’s
people for God’s expectancies: dictation of <u>words</u> (Exodus <b>31</b>:18),
revelation of <u>ideas</u> (Galatians <b>1</b>:11-12; 2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:1-8);
bestowed <u>abilities</u> (1 Kings <b>3</b>:4-15; John <b>14</b>:26); planted <u>events</u>
(Acts <b>10</b>:1-34-35-48), and special granting of <u>office</u> (2 Samuel <b>7</b>:1-3,

<u>theories of sin</u> have not been made a test of fellowship even though a
noticeable feature of churches has been to affirm behavioral depravity without
resorting to natural depravity to explain universal sin and the human inability
to save ourselves. The idea of a biologically inherited “fallen nature” from
our first parents is considered unnecessary conceptually, without warrant
biblically, and leading to unacceptable conclusions systematically—regarding,
for example, divine sovereignty in accounting for the variance between God
desire to save all and his decision to save some (2 Peter <b>3</b>:9).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            People
from Christian background strive for flexibility and mutual respect in how far
to suppose implied cultural limitation in New Testament interpretation. The
concept applies to matters like veil-wearing, table fellowship (1 Corinthians <b>5</b>:11),
wearing jewelry and cosmetics (1 Peter <b>3</b>:3), hair length, dietary observances
(Romans<b> 14</b>:13-23), men-women relationship in general ministry. Such
matters in themselves seem non-interpersonal, whose meanings are more
culturally informed (custom) than inherently determined (morality). “Culturally
informed” indicates that people groups invest them with meanings not necessary
to them. The issues are interpersonal only insofar as people have invested them
with such values rather than being so by the nature of divine intent. People
are advised to look beyond overt acts to the motives and attitudes of the heart
behind them while considering the impact of such acts on other people (Romans <b>14</b>:20-21).</span></p>
