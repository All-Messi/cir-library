<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  One of the biggest
plagues in Bible study is failing to see the “big picture.” We tend to read a
verse and discuss it. As a result, that statement gets lifted from its setting
and put in the context of people’s interests or problems even when it may not
belong there. Foreign ideas come into the picture because context is not kept
in mind. Bible study needs to cover large portions to keep in sight the general
flow of thought. In addition, the total purpose and character of Christian
understanding must provide the framework for individual doctrines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Several advantages
come from emphasizing an overview. For one thing, <u>it shows the relative
importance of certain items in the Bible</u>. In light of the overall purpose
of Christ’s life-death-resurrection for our salvation, how important would it
be whether he died on a pole instead of a cross, whether the cross was shaped
like a “T” or an “X” rather than the traditional form? How much would it matter
whether there were two or three other men crucified with Jesus? Do we have to
decide whether it occurred at Gordon’s Calvary outside the Crusader Wall or
within the confines of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher? There may be ways to
solve questions like these sometimes, but how important are they to solve? Without
the whole picture, we cannot compare the “size” of one item with the size of
the whole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  For another thing,
seeing the big picture <u>helps us decide whether to make a given issue<b> </b>a
matter of fellowship</u>. Division among Christians often results from matters
that have little impact on <u>Christian living and obedience</u>. What
difference does it make whether the rapture occurs after, before, or during the
tribulation—or whether there is a special tribulation period? Does Christ come
before or after the millennium—or is there a separate millennial age at all? All
Christians must remain faithful to the point of death. We can wait to see how
God works out such matters, and we can wait in Christian unity. There can be
personal differences in factual understanding on such considerations because
they do not have a “<u>practical correlate</u>.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Understanding the
character and purpose of Christianity <u>helps us make<b> </b>decisions about
moral matters not specifically treated in Scripture</u>. Contraceptives were
not generally available to first-century men and women. Does that alter
anything about premarital and extra-marital sexual relations? Unless we
understand the principles involved, we will be limited to operating from
specific statements about do’s and don’t’s, and we will not be able to address
important issues the New Testament does not address.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A grasp of the whole <u>helps
us see through apparent contradictions</u>. The Scripture has many little “brain
teasers” like Galatians <b>6</b>:2 + 5: <i>“Bear one another’s burdens”</i>; <i>“each
person will bear his own burden.”</i> Remembering the interpersonal character
of Christianity suggests observations that make these complementary rather than
contradictory, generalities rather than absolutes. Do Christians sin or not (1
John <b>1</b>:8; <b>3</b>:6)? Does God care for animals or not (1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:9;
Matthew <b>10</b>:29)? Was Jesus deity or not (James <b>1</b>:13; Hebrews<b> 4</b>:15)?
In these and many others, the principle is the same: apparent contradictions
disappear in light of <i>“the rest of the story.”</i>   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <i>“The whole is more
than the sum of the parts.”</i> A car is more than a tire and a carburetor and
radiator and a bumper,<i> etc</i>. We could lay out all the parts in a parking
lot, but we would not have a car. The relationship between the parts would not
exist. Seeing the whole <u>helps us see the meaning of the parts and clarifies
the role played by each one</u>. Christian baptism, for example, loses its
ritualistic, legal feel when we see its interpersonal context. Baptism is a
personal commitment by a person to a person. From this starting point, we
derive other matters associated with Christian baptism. This element in
Christianity gets its character from the kind of thing Christianity is as a
whole. Knowing the whole puts a context around individual pieces that are then
qualified by that context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Since the broad scope
clarifies meaning and removes apparent contradictions, it <u>helps<b> </b>give
confidence in the truth of what we believe</u>. Consequently, we give ourselves
more wholeheartedly to the ministry of that message. There comes a more natural
feel for what we need to stress in our work. We may even be able to remember
better the parts of Christian doctrine because motivation for permanent
learning is higher when we have confidence in the truth of what we study. Remembering
itself is easier when we understand what we learn.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There is no substitute
for real understanding, but it does not come without a grasp of the “big
picture.”</span></p>
