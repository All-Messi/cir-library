<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Scripture
is the complete word of God written and sufficiently accurate in origin and
preservation to accomplish what God sent it to accomplish (Isaiah <b>55</b>:11).
He sent it through chosen representatives endowed with the messages he revealed
to them and with the ability to correctly express it to the ones he wanted to
hear it. Consequently, non-canonical writings have the status, at best, of
devotional writings (Apocrypha and tradition).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>FAITH</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Faith
has two applications in its general interpersonal usage. (1) Belief/knowledge
about information on matters that we do not personally experience. It is
usually provided by another person (or perhaps the consistency of some<u>thing</u>
that operates). (2) Trust in another person to produce <u>results</u> that our
own actions do not produce, including renewed personal relationships with God
(salvation) and other people (fellowship), as well as reward for service people
have done performed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            God
is a person rather than a force, thing, or idea; hence, he has <u>purpose</u>
as well as the delight of his actions (his “pleasure”). He has <u>power</u>
above what else exists and <u>authority</u> over what else is, because he
originated the rest. He is eternal past and future and transcendent above other
kinds of things, while imminent in relationship to the other realities,
including us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>CREATION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Creation
is what exists distinct from God as its personal creator, who decided to make
it. So creation has beginning and can have end, and is secondary to the personal
creator, who controls and gives predetermined destiny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Mankind
is made in the image and likeness of God, the image being the interpersonal
capacity. People have responsibility for the creation in which God put them
(Hebrews <b>1</b> &lt; Psalm <b>8</b>). He created them male and female to form
together one flesh in pairs (socio-physical unit). That interpersonal
combination reflects the divine trinity—alike but different with overlapping
roles in common purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Jesus
is the Messiah the Old Testament predicted (Psalm <b>2</b>; Daniel (<b>2</b>:13-14;
7:13-14<b>9</b>:24-27), who is called the Son of God in that unique sense. He existed
before the world and became one with us in human-divine form. That could happen
because God created the human form in the image and likeness of the divine
(interpersonal capacity, <i>etc</i>.). That leads to incarnation via virgin
birth. The Son did not have to give up anything in his own nature during
incarnation except the free exercise of his prerogatives as deity (Philippians<b>
2</b>:5-11) while he took on the human distinctive: he became flesh. That human
situation did not interfere with his divine characteristics except in the free
exercise of his prerogatives as deity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>SALVATION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Salvation
is interpersonal reconciliation (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:18-20; Ephesians <b>2</b>:16)
from alienation caused by behavior contrary to personal relationship. The
apostle Paul characterizes his calling as a “ministry of reconciliation” (2
Corinthians <b>5</b>:18). It involves repentance by the sinner and forgiveness
by the one sinned against. Christ provided the basis for atonement by becoming
in the human arena everything God intended humans to be. If we are willing to
identify with Christ, that is, commit to his lordship, values, and purpose totally,
permanently, and exclusively, the Father is willing to view us as righteous like
him, which leads to renewed relationship with God, that is, salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>BAPTISM</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Baptism
is a formal act by which we identify with Christ. Based on that identity with him,
the Father if willing to view us as like him, hence good and therefore able to
be in relationship with a good God. As to meaning, it is first associated with <u>salvation</u>
from alienation, which leads to being associated with the <u>church</u> as all
those who share that identity with Christ. Likewise comes the gift of the Holy
Spirit, which means personal divine presence in the person of the Spirit in
guidance, empowerment, and intercession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            As
to form, baptism pictures the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ and represents
of the death of our old person and resurrection to new one (Romans <b>6</b>:4-7).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>CHURCH       </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
church is people who share relationship with God through identity with Christ. It
is persons before it is structure, and its organization is quite simple. Its
role is to be a fellowshiping, worshiping, learning, witnessing entity in the
world. It witnesses to the grace of God (influence) rather than being the
channel of his grace in a legal sense (authority).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

SUPPER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
Lord’s Supper is an act of worship that for believers serves as a re-identification
with Christ. The “elements” <u>represent</u> rather than <u>are</u> his body
and blood. Observing the elements is an act of worship and commitment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
Father-Son-Spirit is an interpersonal threeness-in-oneness. They are distinct
enough from each other individually for the Son to <u>pray</u> to the Father to
<u>send</u> <u>another</u> Comforter (John <b>14</b>:16). They are close enough
to have <u>common</u> purpose, <u>unity</u> of operation, and <u>shared</u>
values in accomplishing the common purpose. They are of the <u>same nature</u>
and <u>unique</u> in being so. They have the <u>same identity</u>—one
spirit—comparable to husband-wife as being “one flesh.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            God
has revealed the future to us in the present to guarantee hope that good will
triumph over evil—that God will fulfill his purpose. Items involved in that
process include the intermediate state between death and the general resurrection,
the personal universal observable second coming of Christ, the resurrection of
the just and unjust, judgment to come, the eternal state, as well as less clear
matters along the way like the millennium, the tribulation, and the rapture. The
timetable, sequence, and exact nature depend on their fulfillment to bring
clarification. Consequently, the future is destiny, not just eventuation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
characteristics of positive personal relationship establish the character of
the Christian worldview. That derives from the fact that personal relationship
with its characteristics is the most original, most universal, most central,
most all-pervasive, most eternal, most ultimate, mightiest, and most complex
reality there is. All the great summaries of functional truth reflect that
conviction: God’s great love for the world (John <b>3</b>:16), the First and Second
Great Commandments (Deuteronomy <b>6</b>:5; Leviticus <b>19</b>:18), the Golden
Rule (Matthew<b> 7</b>:12), and <i>“what God requires of us”</i> (Micah <b>6</b>:8).</span></p>
