margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Christian worldview is interpersonal. The
interpersonal “category” is the ultimate frame of reference that qualifies and
limits the impersonal realities that are also part of full picture. Some major
aspects of Christianity are summarized below in ways that correlate with this
understanding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Scripture:</b> Special revelation is
interpersonal communication from God to mankind, available to us in written
form. Although God could have chosen to relate to us in some other fashion, he
spoke to most people through representatives whose messages are preserved in
the Old and New Testament writings. We speak of those writings as inerrant
relative to the (a) intended (b) content of (c) scripture as such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>God:</b> The most fundamental truth
about God is that he is a person rather than an idea, a principle, a force, a
subjective feeling. The godhead comprised of Father, Son, and Spirit is an
interpersonal unity who share the characteristics distinctive to deity; they
have an interpersonal threeness-in-oneness and have sufficient distinction to
meet the requirements of John <b>14</b>:26—at least during “time.” That means
there must be enough distinction between them for the Son to pray to the
Father, for the Father to send the Spirit, and for the Spirit to be <u>another</u>
Comforter/Advocate. Father-Son-Spirit work in complementary fashion to bring
about the shared eternal purpose(s).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ontological deity is a characteristic of
the Son even during incarnation. His virgin birth was a historical event as was
his empty-tomb resurrection and bodily ascension to the right hand of the
Father.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Spirit is likewise a person in
contrast to a subjective feeling, a corporate atmosphere among Christ’s
followers, a force field, or aura. He relates to Christians as a person; we
know about his presence by revealed promise rather than by direct perception
even in the case of those through whom God chose to manifest his power
supernaturally (Judges <b>16:</b>20).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Creation and Providence:</b> The
natural order, the universe, is distinct from God rather than being part of
him, being the same as him, or being made out of him. Though different from it,
God is present with, and available to, his creation. He directs it toward his
purposes by natural law and providential intervention. His personal creations
experience freedom within a framework, as within a broad arrow whose boundaries
are established by natural limitations, supernatural intervention, and special
revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Anthropology:</b> All humankind
individually have the creatable image (<i>vs.</i> the ethical image), that is,
the interpersonal capacity. Every person who has by degrees come to moral
awareness (Romans <b>9</b>:7; cp. Isaiah <b>7</b>:16) has sinned personally and
continues to fall short of the glorious divine standard (Romans <b>3</b>:23a +
b). Universal, all-pervasive sin arises from different forms of <u>ignorance</u>
(the subjective viewpoint, factual unawareness, misunderstood good example, God’s
invisibleness), <u>evil influence</u> (evil example, misunderstood good
example, social pressure, reinforcement), and <u>pervertible desires</u>
(physical and psychological). The results of these factors end up embedded in
us by virtue of the capacity for habit formation. Sin is also <u>easier</u>. It
is easier—though less fulfilling—to live imminently than transcendently,
eschatologically, or socially.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Salvation and Christian Growth:</b> Salvation
is interpersonal reconciliation with God (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:18-20). It is
available to everyone, conditioned on identification with Jesus Christ as the
only one through whom God has offered people reconciliation (Acts <b>4</b>:12).
Identity with Christ is deliberate, total, permanent, and exclusive of all
parallel possibilities. It means aspiration to carry our obedience to the
Father to the same level as Christ carried his obedience in our arena. It means
commitment to him as a person and willingness to accept his lordship in
everything, his purposes for our future, and his values for our living. Identification
with Christ includes our sense of being on his side as well as our sense of who
we are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            No one can save himself, because of what
salvation is: interpersonal reconciliation. (a) The decisive act in any
reconciliation is done by the person sinned against. By its very nature, (b)
imperfection is impossible to overcome, and perfection is the natural standard
for all cases of fellowship. (c) By sinning, we have identified ourselves with
Satan/First Adam and cannot rise above the destiny pronounced upon that group. (d)
We need the ongoing good influence of other persons—God and God’s people
alike—to provide adequate motivational resources for overcoming lifelong sins
as habits. Even then we will rid ourselves of actual imperfection, at least in
this life. Finally, (e) salvation as reconciliation is based on being <u>viewed</u>
as righteous in contrast to being righteous. Being considered righteous by God
he condition on identity with him who is righteous, an identity we choose to
trust as a basis for forgiveness and reconciliation. As in any interpersonal
relationship, righteousness refers to the way the sinner is regarded by the
other as conditioned on identification with the one viewing him. Within that
framework, honest aspiration for righteousness is counted in place of actual
accomplishment. In reconciliation with God, the Father has willed that people
indicate honest aspiration for righteousness by identifying with the Righteous
One and committing themselves to his lordship, values, and purposes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Ordinances: </b>Since salvation is
reconciliation and therefore the re-establishment of interpersonal
relationship, all relevant acts are interpersonal ones. Even formal acts in
initial and continued identity with Christ have an interpersonal character
rather than a legal one.<b> </b>Since the covenant is interpersonal in nature,
basis, and purpose (Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-43), the ordinances of the covenant
are interpersonal. Therefore, baptism is a performative act of personal
identification with Christ. On the basis of that identity, God forgives sin,
grants fellowship with his Spirit, and numbers us among his saved people. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Lord’s Supper is also a performative
act of worship and re-identification with him. In an interpersonal setting,
formal acts have no meaning except what the doer means into them, and they can
have no value aside from the performer’s intentions; hence, their validity does
not depend on an administrator or rest in the sheer performance itself. Neither
does their value come about in some way from legal, logical, or natural
causality. The “ordinances” are operative purely as interpersonal acts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Ethics:</b> Moral behavior is measured
relative to divine purposes as reflected in revelation and creation itself and
relative to what is appropriate to persons in relationship. Christianity is not
simply a moral system, but as part of its interpersonal concern it has moral
standards by which persons are to conduct themselves in relational and
purposeful matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Ecclesiology:</b> The church is saved
people serving divine purposes in the name of Christ. It is an interpersonal
entity. As such, the form it may have is secondary to its constituents and
mission. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Eschatology:</b> Christ’s return will
be an objective, personal, visible, universal one. How his coming relates
sequentially to other clear predictions and promises we are not able to say in
some cases. In other words, we are wise not to consider the millennium and
related events as matters of fellowship or leadership qualification,
particularly since it has no clear behavioral correlates in personal living or
Christian mission.</span></p>
