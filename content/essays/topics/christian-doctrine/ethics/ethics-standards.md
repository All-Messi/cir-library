<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is the standard and the <u>basis</u> for it? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In <i>That Hideous Strength</i> (p. 285)
C. S. Lewis has Dr. Cecil Dimble telling his wife that polygamy was not wrong
for Abraham. That comment seems misleading, but it does raise the question
about standards. There seems to be more than one way of speaking of an “ethical
standard.” There is <b>(a)</b> <u>the ideal standard</u>, the one that God has
always had in mind for everyone everywhere. The ideal standard is based on the <u>originating
purpose</u> of God before <u>creation</u>. PURPOSE</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A second standard is <b>(b) </b><u>the
circumstantial standard</u>, the one that God holds people responsible for
relative to the <u>revelation</u> they have received. In this second standard,
belongs Paul’s comment that in the times of that ignorance God overlooked (Acts
<b>17</b>:30). It is a standard relative to knowledge, an expectancy relative
to a person’s opportunities and privileges. RELATIONSHIP</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another standard might be called <b>(c)</b>
<u>the developmental standard</u>, or the progressive standard, which
correlates with where a person is or where mankind is as they are “growing up.”
Jesus appeals to that basis when he says Moses made a concession in allowing
divorce for any reason <i>“because of the hardness of your hearts”</i> (Matthew
<b>19</b>:8 = Mark<b> 10</b>:5<sup>1</sup>). Here God expects people to live up
at least to where they are<u>,</u> what they can do at that point in their maturation.
Educators call it “readiness.” It is a standard based on <u>ability</u>, the
one we use with our children as they are growing up. Paul calls it a tutor
leading us to Christ (Galatians <b>3</b>:24). There is a difference between
what can realistically be legislated (“actionable”) and what people should do.
By appealing to the original creation situation as more original, Jesus argued
that divorce in the Mosaic Law was a concession due to insensitivity<i>.</i> National
laws do not embody everything that personal morality calls for. The Mosaic Law
was a secondary standard based on rules and regulations, which was a lesser
ideal than the one based on reality, divine purpose, or the character of
positive interpersonal relationship. NATURE</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Fourth is <b>(d)</b> <u>the practical
standard</u>, the one that people expect from others given the <u>temptations</u>
of their circumstance, the opposition they face, the weaknesses they have. <i>“He
knows our frame”</i> (Psalm <b>103</b>:14). The practical standard relates to
the developmental one but differs in that it does not necessarily envision the
issue in linear terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is <b>(e)</b> <u>the remedial
standard</u> relative to which God—or the other person—is willing to forgive because
of <u>repentance</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Beyond this, lies <b>(f) </b><u>conventional
standard</u> based on <u>social consensus</u>. But when we move to that
standard, we have moved beyond what we have in mind when we speak of ethical or
moral matters. That standard is what non-Christians may suppose all “morality”
really is. It has the character of language or mores. People agree on them, not
because reality calls for them, but so they can communicate. In practice,
legislation addresses the need to eliminate one person using force against
another. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            At the individual level, there is the <b>(g)
</b><u>standard of conscience</u>. In Romans <b>2</b>, Paul may have that idea
in mind, <i>“Whatever is not of faith is sin”</i> (Romans <b>14</b>:23). It is
sin for <u>you</u> because it goes against your internal standard even though
your conscience is misguided on that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The question here is whether these are all
<u>ethical</u> or <u>moral</u> standards. It might be less confusing to speak
of one standard, the ideal one; or perhaps of two, the ideal and the revealed
one, the revealed one being possibly less. But, it does look obvious that in a
biblical sense we may speak of some ethical relativity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Where is the standard contained?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It can be misleading to say that polygamy
was not wrong for Abraham. That comment makes morality look relative, as if the
standard changes. It is better to say that something is wrong regardless of
whether people know it or not, whether they believe it or not, whether they can
live up to it or not. The difference does not lie in the standard but in
whether God reckons failures to live up to it. The fact that it does not
destroy people or separate them from God (destroy them or cause disfellowship
or lostness) does not mean it is not wrong in the “first place” (theory).
Rather, it is not destructive in the “last place” (practice). Between the “two
places” stands God who chooses not to hold against people (second place) their behavior
contrary to the standard (first place). The fact that polygamy <u>was</u> wrong
for Abraham in a sense, C. S. Lewis acknowledges when Dr. Dimble goes on to
say, <i>“ . . . but one can’t help feeling even he lost something by it.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is the <u>origin</u> of the standard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The standard does not originate (1) <u>beyond
God</u>, as the ancient Fates lay beyond the Greek and Roman gods so that even
they were subject to them. We do not place these standards beyond God to
preserve the idea that God is himself ethical. If we were to put them beyond
God, we could not speak of him as sovereign; he would not be ultimate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            To preserve divine sovereignty, we put the
origin of the standard (2) <u>in God</u>. But when we do so, we cannot allow
ourselves to suppose that he chooses behavior as an (a) <u>arbitrary standard</u>.
He must be true to himself as per his own nature; otherwise, he would become
inconsistent and unethical. But his nature is a given, an ultimate given, because
it did not derive from something more original.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The idea is a restrictive one, the broad
arrow concept, rather than a positive one, a single line arrow. Determinism
restricts down to some level that allows freedom within it based on ability or
natural possibilities. God is sovereign to choose within a limited freedom with
determinism on the outside of freedom, but a determinism within God’s very
nature. There is no (b) <u>deterministic standard</u> arising within God
because that would not be a standard at all (see below under <u>nature</u> of
the standard). Furthermore, it would not be personal or interpersonal. In
Christianity we take it as given that God is a person, personal, interpersonal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is the <u>purpose</u> of the standard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A standard is not a standard for its own
sake. It is a standard relative to a purpose or consequence; it has a
functional goal. The functional goal in the case of <u>ethical standard</u> is
positive personal relationship, which leads to structuring and handling
non-personal factors in human existence. So, there is more involved than
idealism, rules and regulations disconnected from purpose. There is no
perfectionism for its own sake or even to please an arbitrary Standard-Setter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is the <u>nature</u> of the standard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is an <u>interpersonal standard</u>
rather than an impersonal one. So, it is not an abstract, metaphysical, or
deterministic pattern. It would not be a standard at all if it were
deterministic because it would be what it would be. We speak of standards only
when something can operate in more than one way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>_______________</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <sup>1</sup>Another, better way of taking
Jesus’ statement invokes a distinction between what is actionable under human legal
process and what has always been God’s moral intention.</span></p>
