<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In non-Christian societies, people wonder
whether they can continue in their jobs if they become Christians. The minister
of a new congregation in Moscow asked about that issue. A policeman had asked
whether he would have to quit his job if he accepted Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A policeman would not have to give up his
source of income in accepting Christ. Paul states the principle in 1
Corinthians<b> 7</b>:20: <i>“Let people stay in the calling where they were
when they were called.” </i>Paul is addressing marriage issues, but he is
drawing on a broader principle because he also connects it with slavery (<b>7</b>:21-24)
and circumcision (<b>7</b>:18-19). Christianity is transcultural and
trans-vocational; it has no racial, social, marital, economic, societal, or
vocational association. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            But, some practices in many jobs and
statuses do not fit with what Christ <u>is</u> concerned about. An example in
scripture is the response John the Baptist makes to tax collectors and soldiers
in Luke <b>3</b>:12-14. Being a tax collector or a soldier <u>might</u> involve
expectations that God’s servant could not include in <u>his</u> tax collecting
or soldiering. A “publican” could not indulge in collecting more taxes than
required so he could make extra profit. Soldiers could not be John’s followers
and misuse their position to extort money, to falsely accuse them for some personal
advantage, or to do anything for selfish gain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As to being a policeman, taking bribes
would not be something Christian policemen could do. They could not stop
motorists on the pretense of checking their papers and then imply that they
were going to charge drivers with speeding unless some “satisfaction” was given
in the form of money or a “gift” of some kind. Such things involve lying and abuse
of authority. Since that possibility would not have to be part of their work,
policemen could continue their work without yielding to that temptation no
matter how customary it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some vocations do require people to engage
in what their Christian commitment disallows. In conflicts of authority,
Christians must choose which authority to follow. The ethical principle is to put
Christ’s authority in highest position and arrange other authorities under it. Under
that hierarchical arrangement, we can fulfill everyone’s requirements as long
as those requirements do not conflict with Christ’s authority. No one can have
two masters (Matthew <b>6</b>:24), so to speak. Each of us must put one
authority in first position and make others secondary. For us, God and Christ
have ultimate position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            When two authorities place conflicting
demands, we obey the higher authority rather than the immediate one. Peter and
John invoked that principle when the authorities arrested them for healing the
lame man at Gate Beautiful: <i>“We cannot say other than what we have seen and
heard”</i> (Acts <b>4</b>:20). They prioritized Christ over the Jewish state even
though doing so could have had serious consequences. In a conflict of
authorities, obeying the highest one contrasts with obeying the immediately
superior authority, who takes the penalty if it is wrong. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In Christ, the one who does the wrong is
guilty of the wrong and bears the penalty for it. If we prioritize Christ’s authority
in moral matters, we can remain in whatever calling we had before we accepted him.</span></p>
