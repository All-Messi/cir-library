style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Virgil Warren, PhD</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> I.  Not My Body, Not My Choice</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            It is the other within
the mother. It has its own DNA, its own blood type, its own sex, its own body
type, skin tone, eye color, and eventually all the features that make it a
distinct individual. Choice does come into the picture; it comes in the mother’s
behaviors prior to the pregnancy. We have no right to take out on the baby our
own sexual irresponsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>            As we say with other physical matters, “go with
the science.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>II. The Safety of Pregnancies </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            Exceptional cases include
rape, incest, the life of the mother, and perhaps some other highly detrimental
physical circumstance. Psychological negatives may have to be dealt with by
counseling, medical assistance, or adoption. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            “Hard cases make bad
law.” We do not use unusual situations to set the procedures for normal ones. What
makes situations unusual does not exist in typical cases. We do need to deal
sensitively with such cases, and decisions about them must lie first with the mother
in consultation with medical professionals. Physicians are in a better position
to know what will be dysfunctional without the “heroic efforts” terminally ill
patients can sign away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            If the mother’s life is
at stake, allowing an abortion avoids losing the mother too. If the fetus has
died, the situation does not involve taking a life. Other exceptional cases may
come to light as well, but modern medical expertise reduces the number of
circumstances where the life of the baby or the mother is at stake. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>            In the case of rape or incest, abortion is a form
of self-defense. People have a right to defend themselves against abuse; a
woman has a right to defend herself against what her attacker has done to her.
In principle, rape should be as subject to capital punishment for the rapist as
murdering a victim is. That is the psychological effect on the woman as well as
the physical effect on what is conceived. Guilt is personal, so the assailant bears
the guilt of what it takes to rectify what he has caused.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>III. Abortion as the Baby’s Experience</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            It’s the baby, not the
mother, that feels the pain in the cases of “the silent scream,” especially
with abortions that dismember the baby. The procedure is not like removing a
defective kidney or amputating a leg infected with gangrene. The vast majority
of abortions do not deal with dysfunctional fetuses, <u>and</u> the fetus is
not part of the mother. Particularly heinous is the depersonalizing practice of
harvesting body parts for profit; it is a form of self-centeredness, which is
the essence of immorality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            Euthanizing the preborn
does not differ from euthanasia generally, and it happens without the consent
of the victim and aside from the “hard cases” associated with the euthanasia
issue itself. Ahead of time, terminally ill patients or those with the power of
attorney to act for them can sign away the use of “heroic efforts” to prolong
their life that cannot recover; so to speak, the mother has the “power of
attorney” to act on behalf of the unviable fetus that is within her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            Except in the “hard
cases,” abortion sets aside “reverence for human life,” especially in cases of
near-term and full-term abortions. Aborting what could live outside the womb is
the same as the infanticide practiced by ancient (and modern) pagans. Not
location but viability establishes the moral circumstance; it is infanticide in
either case. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            Admittedly, the early
stages of fetal development do not involve viability aside from total
dependence on the mother. But the fact that the “person in progress” is not
self-sufficient does not justify ending the pregnancy any more than killing a
two-year-old does. Reliance on other people continues in decreasing degrees even
up into adulthood; murdering an adult in principle is no different in <u>kind</u>
than killing a preborn baby; it is a matter of <u>degree</u> all the way along.
Prohibiting the former while advocating the latter illustrates lack of
perception; it reveals self-centeredness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            Three final notes: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            (a) the
“adoption option” exists as an amoral alternative to abortion; there is no real
need to invoke abortion to solve even a perceived burden that is unbearable
under the circumstances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            (b) Abortion
is not for population control; there are other ways of maintaining reasonable
population levels. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>            (c) Abortion
as a general practice is one more departure from interpersonalism as the
highest frame of reference for human life and living. </span></p>
