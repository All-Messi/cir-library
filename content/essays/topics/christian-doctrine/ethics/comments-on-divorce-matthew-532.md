<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'><i>“Everyone that puts away his wife—except for sexual immorality—treats*
her like an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>            For purposes here, we pass over some technicalities
associated with the aorist passive infinitive (<span lang=EL>μοιχευθῆναι</span>,
<i>moicheuthēnai</i>, <i>“makes her to be adulterated[?]”</i>) and deal with more
straightforward considerations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>            Jesus teaches that divorce is contrary to God’s original
intention for marriage. Marriage is no longer the way it was under the Mosaic Law,
where a husband could legally divorce his wife even if she had not been unfaithful.
No longer could he, for example, use divorce to avoid adultery—divorce his wife
to marry “the other woman.” Such a thing amounts to adultery in motive and
attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>            Adultery is the basis Jesus gives here for divorcing a wife. So,
under that principle, by divorcing her, a husband is indicating that she has
been sexually immoral. He makes her an adulteress <i>“in the eyes of other
people”</i>; he represents her as unfaithful. If she did commit adultery, she
made herself an adulteress, which is the point of the exception clause. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>If she was <u>not</u> unfaithful to him, he “treated”* her like she was; he
“made her out” to be so. He “made” her an adulteress in the same sense as people
who say they have not sinned make* God a liar (1 John <b>1</b>:10; cp. <b>5</b>:10).
God is not a liar; so “makes” him a liar means “treats” him like one. When people
deny their own sinfulness, they act as if God is lying when he claims that all
have sinned and fall short of the God’s glory (Romans <b>3</b>:23). The same
word appears in Matthew’s and John’s statements (<span lang=EL>ποιέω</span>, <i>poieō</i>):
<i>“makes her an adulteress”</i> and <i>“makes God a liar.”</i> A similar
meaning for the word appears in John <b>10</b>:33 and <b>19</b>:7, when
religious leaders accuse Jesus of making himself equal with God. These leaders
likewise tell Pilate that whoever makes himself king speaks against Caesar,
though of course, they did not believe he was (John <b>19</b>:12). <u>Guilt is
personal</u> so people cannot make other people sinners any more than they can
make themselves God or king or make God a liar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>In saying that whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery, Jesus means
marrying a woman who <u>was</u> divorced for adultery. A man who marries that
kind of woman shows that he is like her; her character does not matter to him. Taken
this way, the reference to <i>“her who was been put away”</i> is to the basic
principle—no divorce except for adultery. Understood that way, the idea
becomes: <i>“Whoever divorces his wife—except for sexual immorality—treats her
like an adulteress because that is what divorce is for, and whoever marries her
that has been divorced for adultery commits adultery himself.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>Marrying someone <u>not</u> legitimately divorced raises a situation that
lies beyond the scope of Matthew <b>5</b>:32, but some points seem appropriate
regarding the “innocent party.” <b>(a)</b> If a woman was divorced without
being unfaithful, marrying her involves a different motive. Marrying her would
not be committing adultery because it does not involve a lack of concern for her
immorality—there was no immorality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>Secondly, <b>(b)</b> in Matthew <b>19</b>:10-13, Jesus’ disciples
conclude, if that is the way marriage is, it would be better not to get
married. Jesus answers that not everybody can live that way (from a practical
standpoint). His comment reflects the creation account, where God said it was
not good for the man to be alone. It relates also to Paul’s observation that
not everyone has the gift of continence; so Paul concedes that it is better to
marry than to “burn” (presumably with sexual desire; 1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:8-9).
For most people, the single state is not desirable in itself, <i>“It’s not good
for the man to be alone”</i> (Genesis<b> 2</b>:18). That would seem to be truer
after being married. Matthew <b>5</b>:32 is speaking about the theory of marriage,
but Jesus’ additional comments in Matthew <b>19</b> and Paul’s advice in 1 Corinthians
<b>7</b> indicate that <u>practical need</u> may override <u>basic theory</u>
in this matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>The unnaturalness of the single state for most people brings to mind Abraham’s
point that <b>(c) </b>God surely does not punish the righteous with the wicked.
<i>“The Judge of all the earth does right, doesn’t he?”</i> (Genesis <b>18</b>:23,
25). Good people do suffer at the hand of bad people; but in God’s forbidding
innocent parties to remarry, he would in principle be <u>setting things up</u> to
require unnaturalness and even hardship on the part of the innocent because of
the sins of the guilty. That would seem to go beyond <i>suffering</i> <u>allowed</u>
to <i>unhappiness</i> <u>required</u>, hence, punishment, even though a
wholesome alternative could be allowed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'><b>(d)</b> Paul says finally that we have been called to peace (1
Corinthians <b>7</b>:15). An unnatural state would not seem to be what a person
would consider “peace.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
117%'>Beyond matters noted here, a more complete treatment of divorce should consider
the impact of repentance on the question as well as circumstances like
desertion or physical, emotional, and verbal abuse.</p>
