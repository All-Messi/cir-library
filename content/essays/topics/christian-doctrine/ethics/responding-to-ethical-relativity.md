<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Relativity in ethics seems
sensible because (a) incompatible moral beliefs and practices exist, and (b) no
one seems able to establish a universal basis for ethical theory.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In response to the second
point, (1) the presence of a <u>universal God</u> (creator, sustainer,
intervener) provides that universal basis. It does so because he had purpose in
creating and if he has created us in his image. Furthermore, (2) <u>human
nature</u> is universal for humans. We should not do what is contrary to human
nature physically, psychologically, and socially; we should practice what
enhances well-being, peace, and unity under God’s values. Presumably there is a
hierarchy of what yields greater or lesser satisfaction, gratification, peace, and
happiness, according to how well actions correlate with the givens of human
nature—matters like the desire to be <u>loved</u>, the drive for <u>worth</u>,
the urge for <u>security</u>, the impulse for <u>innocence</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We can ask why we do not
choose to do what contributes toward greater self-fulfillment and social
satisfaction. The answer corresponds with the reasons we yield to temptation. <b>(a)</b>
<u>Immediate gratification</u> rather than delayed gratification takes its toll
because our perceivable situation seems more “real” than the distant time,
place, or realm (the eschatological, the supernatural). <b>(b)</b> <u>Rationalization</u>
comes in when we play the odds and suppose that what comes to others will not
happen to me. <b>(c)</b> <u>Social pressure</u> has its effect because we are
often more sensitive to the influence of the many than of the few in trying to foster
acceptance. <b>(d)</b> <u>Ignorance</u> affects our choices when we do not
realize that a better way of exists for bringing human joy. Finally, <b>(e) </b>we
maintain<b> </b><u>low expectations</u> because we have no hope of breaking out
of our less than satisfying condition. No one seems to be around that will
provide that better circumstance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Life is structured in a way
that makes it <u>easier</u> to do what brings less satisfaction than to do what
brings more long-term fulfillment. Playing basketball is more satisfying than being
a couch potato. It is <u>easier</u> to respond to the immediate situation, but
delayed gratification is usually more gratifying. It is <u>easier</u> to deal
with physical matters, but transcendent psychological fulfillment makes for a
better life. It is <u>easier</u> to act in our own interests, but responding to
someone’s thoughtfulness is more rewarding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The fact that mutually
exclusive moral practices exist or the fact that people have not come to
agreement on a universal ethical basis does not work against ethical theory. Those
practical observations merely reflect human imperfection, which is the very
problem ethics addresses. Human failures in moral behavior are not reasons for having
no way to measure moral behavior. “What is” does not determine “What ought.” </span><span
