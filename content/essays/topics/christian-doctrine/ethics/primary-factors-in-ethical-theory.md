<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Conclusions about specific moral matters
depend on what framework we use when we think about them. Several fundamental
constructs set limits on how Christians should act. The factors involved help
us interpret scripture correctly when it does address moral issues we face. Those
factors are particularly vital when we have to generalize biblical standards to
questions that special revelation does not address. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <b>first primary framework</b> focuses
on start-up factors that impact human behavior:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Out of the (1) <u>nature of God</u>
comes the (2) <u>purpose of God</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Out of the <u>purpose of God</u>
comes the (3) <u>creation by God</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Out of the <u>nature of creation by
God</u> comes the (4) <u>human behavior</u> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        (including <u>human nature</u>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Several features of this layout call for
comment. First, <u>out of the (1) nature of God comes the (2) purpose of God</u>.
The nature of God establishes and limits the possibilities for everything else
because in the Christian worldview everything else comes logically after God. Christianity
understands that God is (1) personal; so the subsequent possibilities include
(2) purpose, which arises out of personal capacity. God purposes, and purpose
establishes boundaries for proper behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This step in the analysis includes a
significant fact: as goes the character of the god, so goes the character of
the whole religion. The God of the Bible is ethical deity, not just powerful
deity; he is ultimate being (Exodus <b>3</b>:14), and people are created in his
image with interpersonal capacity (Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27). Consequently, people
should be holy because God is holy (Leviticus <b>19</b>:2; 1 Peter <b>1</b>:16).
If God were not in the picture, the first two elements would be gone as determining
factors for ethics. Human nature itself would become the ultimate basis for
behavior, but that restrains human behavior to little more than animal “ethics.”
It leaves “might makes right,” “end justifies means,” “majority preference” as
bases for ethical theory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Second, <u>out of the (2) purpose of God
comes the (3) creation by God</u>. Placing God’s purposing ahead of his
creating establishes the possibility of non-determinism. Divine purpose for
human behavior can be more narrow than human ability, which avoids determinism.
Personhood involves choice between alternatives, not simply the capacity to
respond to environmental stimuli. Moved by love (interpersonal nature) and
guided by values (purpose), people may decide to restrict behavior from what
they can do to what they should do. There can be freedom within determinism, an
arrangement that allows for responsibility and ethical behavior relative to
purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In theory, behavior rests more basically
on the creator’s purpose than on created nature, even though from a practical
standpoint, doing what God commands does increase happiness in most cases. “Greater
happiness for more people for longer time” implies closer conformity to
individual and social nature. But ethical and moral behavior can rest on more
than created nature, that is, on more than the interpersonal nature of the
individual person, the nature of the interpersonal situation, and the nature of
interpersonal interaction. It can rest directly on divine purpose for people
generally or for a particular person because God can require what has no
necessitating correlate in the human constitution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <b>second primary framework</b> is
that ethics and morality have to do with person-to-person associations. Person-to-thing
and thing-to-thing relationships do not involve right and wrong in a moral
sense. The diagram below pictures a second primary framework, which deals with
the operation of what God purposefully created. It organizes the basic
dimensions of life in terms of personal factors. Life has two primary aspects
often called the “existential” and the “eschatological.” “Existential” refers
to the present experience of “existence,” including relationships <u>vertically</u>
with God (A-1), <u>horizontally</u> with other people (A-2), and <u>internally</u>
between the inner and outer aspects of a person—spirit and flesh (A-3). “Eschatological”
refers to the forward movement of life from purposes toward goals; it
represents not just movement, but directional movement.<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> Primary ethical principles correlate with aspects
of these two main facets of living.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>      I.    The First Great Commandment (A-1)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Loving God with all our being”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> is the most primary ethical principle (Matthew <b>22</b>:34-38;
Mark <b>12</b>:28-30; Luke <b>10</b>:25-28a). If love is defined as principled
behavior for the joy of others, it is more than a feeling; it is a pattern of
behavior characterized by self-giving for the glory of God (John <b>3</b>:16). If
we love him, we do what he says (John<b> 14</b>:23, 15) without feeling “put
upon” (1 John <b>5</b>:3). Love is reciprocal between God and man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>II.  The Golden Rule/The Second Great Commandment
(A-2)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Golden Rule governs relationships
between people (Matthew <b>7</b>:12). <i>“Treating other people the way we want
to be treated”</i> restates the Second Great Commandment—that we should love
our neighbor as we love ourselves (Matthew <b>22</b>:39-40; Mark <b>10</b>:31;
Luke <b>10</b>:29b-37; Romans <b>13</b>:8-10; Galatians<b> 5</b>:13-14). It
gives a “rule-of-thumb” basis for deciding how one person ought to act toward
another, and it does so in a positive as well as negative sense. Love is
reciprocal between people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ideal behavior is more than (a) <u>not
doing</u> what we would not want done to us; it is also a matter of (b) <u>doing</u>
what is to someone else’s benefit. Furthermore, it means (c) doing what we
would <u>prefer</u> to have done to us even though not doing it would not be
sinful, even though doing it would not be necessary, or even though doing it
would not make life intolerable. (Note <i>seemly</i> in 1 Corinthians <b>13</b>:5.)
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, the Golden Rule (d) takes
into account the way <u>they</u> want to be treated, which means taking into
account the differences between people. So it calls for more than treating
other people the way <u>we</u> want to be treated; it means treating them the
way we would want to be treated if we were in their shoes. That broad principle
in the Golden Rule/Second Great Commandment is limited by prior divine purpose,
by the First Great Commandment, by our own integrity as persons, and by their
own need to love God and respect us. Love is mutual respect. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Love is an important behavioral principle,
because it covers the full range of human interaction. It moves us to obey God’s
<u>moral laws</u> and <u>positive commandments</u><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span> (law; John <b>14</b>:21, 23), to take his <u>advice</u><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> (expediency, wisdom), and to
respect others’ <u>preferences</u> (Romans <b>14</b>:15; 1 Corinthians <b>13</b>:5).
We are not acting in love when we grieve someone else by our actions (cp.
Romans <b>14</b>:15). Love takes care of matters of <u>omission</u> (positive)
and <u>commission</u> (negative), <u>faith</u> and <u>opinion</u>. Love is an
all-purpose tool for behavioral decision making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. The Priority of Spirit over Flesh (A-3)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “The priority of spirit over flesh”<b> </b>governs
activity within the individual person. In 1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:12 Paul says
he will<b> </b>not be brought under the power of anything. The principle he
enunciates takes care of why it is wrong to do private practices that cause
addictions and psychological compulsions (“hang-ups”). He goes beyond the
notion of “victimless crimes,” acts that supposedly impact no one but the doer.
Something is wrong if it puts physical drives in ultimate position. Morality
applies not only to behaviors that can be measured quantitatively as to
physical consequences, but also to what has psychological effects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As a principle for our individual use of
the body, asserting the supremacy of spirit over flesh differs from arguing
that we should do what is physically most healthful because our body is the
Spirit’s temple (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:19). Sometimes what is harmful to the
body may take second place to interpersonal considerations implicit in A-1,
A-2, and B-1. For example, certain foods are less healthful for the body than
others; yet Jesus did cleanse all meats (Mark<b> 7</b>:19), which means at
least that dietary laws no longer belong to <u>religious</u> concern; that is,
they are not Christian ethical considerations. <i>“Cleansing all meats”</i>
does not change the <u>scientific</u> fact that some foods are less healthful
particularly for some people. We infer that the body as the temple of the
Spirit does not form an ultimate basis for arguing the <u>moral</u> need to eat
what research shows is the most healthful and to avoid eating what may cause
heart conditions, cancer, high cholesterol, etc. Paul’s positive approach to
ethics within the individual centers around addictiveness, which breaches the
principle of prioritizing spirit over flesh. Since he pictures the body as the
residence of the Holy Spirit, we must not use the body in a way that
subordinates the spirit to the body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul also invokes what could be called “the
nature principle” in ethics. He does so with adultery and homosexuality (Romans
<b>1</b>:26-27) and possibly with the female deference principle expressed in
the first century by veil-wearing (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7, 13-14).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> Nature in this case does not mean
simply what a person has the ability to do. Obviously, people are quite capable
of doing sinful acts. Natural behavior is behavior that is most appropriate to
intended use. It is not physically and psychologically detrimental, it
prioritizes the higher self, and it enhances harmonious intrapersonal and
interpersonal operations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>The one-to-many splice</u>. Ethics not
only needs to address individual behavior and social behavior in themselves; it
needs to describe the boundary between individual freedom and social
responsibility. <u>Individual freedom ends where other individuals’ freedom
begins</u>. Most “victimless crimes” do not affect just the persons who do
them, because people’s lives are so intertwined that the behavior of one ends up
eventually impacting others. Similarly, private acts between “consenting adults”
are matters of morality because the repercussions of private acts can end up
costing society money, effort, and time. They may also depersonalize the other
consenting adult and may prioritize flesh over spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Our individual actions must leave us
able to be responsible for ourselves</u>. What we do is immoral if it makes us
unable to function appropriately in relationships and responsibilities (relate
to B-1).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>IV. Right and Wrong Relative to Purpose (B-1)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Right and wrong, good and bad are
measured relative to purpose</u>. In behavior the ultimate issue is not whether
something is legal under a temporal or divine standard, but whether it is
effective. Abiding principles applicable in all cases are relative to the standing
purposes of God and man. Obviously since people are dependent beings, they
cannot define their own ultimate purpose(s). The purpose measurement for ethics
is first God’s purpose, within which man’s self-chosen purposes may be worked
out. In that framework God allows considerable freedom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Right and wrong focus on motives and
attitude more than on sheer acts taken by themselves. Attitude applies
particularly to interpersonal relationships; motive applies particularly to
purpose. The same act can be good or bad depending on why we do it and on our
attitude toward other people in doing it. A normally good act becomes evil if
done out of selfish motives or with a depersonalizing attitude. In
interpersonal activity intentionality counts for something important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'>      Morality
includes not only what is or is not <u>wrong</u>, but what is <u>wise</u>. Wisdom
brings in practical considerations. Some things may not break any of God’s
abiding principles of behavior, but it is normally not wise to put ourselves in
certain situations. What is possible is not necessarily smart, because we may
not be as strong as we think we are; standing outside the force field of
certain situations, we may suppose that we can handle more than we can. Not
only does wisdom deal with us (which applies also in the “one-many splice”
under A-3); it deals with practical effects on other people. It addresses what
other people prefer, what other people may misread about our motives, and what
other people may slip into doing on the basis of their misreading. Not only is
there <u>commandment</u>; there is <u>advice</u>. And where there is neither
commandment nor advice, <u>love</u> and <u>expediency</u> reign. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>The existential-eschatological splice</u>.
As there is a point of contact in the existential aspect between the individual
and the group, so also there is a point of contact between the existential and
the eschatological. <u>Right and wrong are measured relative to purpose as
qualified by love</u><b>.</b> Latitude and longitude (the existential and the
eschatological) combine in ethical choices. <u>Ethics prioritizes purpose over
pleasure</u>—spiritual over material—because purposes are chosen relative to
values, not necessarily rooted in material considerations, but in interpersonal
ones (love). Spiritual and interpersonal are closely related if not identical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Definition Factors</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is time to make explicit what has been
left implicit so far. Appropriate behavior includes not only what is or is not <u>wrong</u>,
but what is <u>wise</u>. Wisdom brings in practical considerations. Some things
may not break any of God’s abiding principles of behavior strictly speaking,
but it is normally not wise for people to put themselves in certain situations.
What is possible is not necessarily smart for people themselves because they
may not be as strong as they think they are; standing outside the force field
of certain situations, they may suppose that they can handle more than they
can. Not only does wisdom deal with the doers themselves (which applies also in
the “one-many splice” under A-3); it deals with practical effects on other
people. It addresses what other people prefer, what other people may easily
misread about the doer’s motives, and what other people may be led into doing
on the basis of their misreading. Consequently, not only is there <u>commandment</u>;
there is <u>advice</u>. And where there is neither commandment nor advice, <u>love</u>
and <u>expediency</u> rule. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This <b>third primary framework</b>
distinguishes three kinds of interpersonal behavior. There is more to choosing
how to act with other people than what is moral or ethical in the strict sense.
(a) <u>Morality</u> is based on originating nature and purpose; uniformity of
action is the understood intent. It is communicated by divine command. Telling
the truth is an example.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><img
width=322 height=131 src="/cir-library/images/essays/primary-factors-in-ethical-theory/image002.png" align=left hspace=12><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The accompanying diagram shows two other
kinds of interpersonal action and their relationship to ethics. People live
best when they live above mere duty, legal minimums, simple                                                   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>right <i>vs.</i> wrong. There is the looser category
(b) “wisdom,” which chooses actions that work better—that are expedient, that
reduce temptation, and so forth. Wisdom is based on practical considerations
about what is most likely to work even though other choices may not necessarily
be wrong. Varying degrees of uniformity are possible. Wisdom is communicated by
“advice.” Advice refers to what is wise, over and above what is moral. If people
do not obey a command, they sin; if they do not take advice, they risk. That is
so because advice deals with good <i>vs.</i> better whereas morality deals with
good <i>vs.</i> bad. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Beyond both of these is (c) “ministry,”
which involves encouragement, evangelism, forgoing rights, helping others
mature, helping them solve their problems, and providing for their needs. Ministry
acts for the welfare of other people, whose needs the minister did not create. Whereas
bearing our own burdens is morality (Galatians <b>6</b>:5), bearing someone
else’s burden is ministry (Galatians <b>6</b>:2). Specific ministry directives
may not apply uniformly to everyone all the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is important to note in this
arrangement that each larger circle includes the smaller ones. Living morally
is also the wise thing to do, and living wisely ministers to other people and
earns the right to help them with their needs. There can be gradations of
uniformity in wisdom and ministry, and there may be gradations out of the one
into the next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Biblical revelation contains all three
categories, not just the moral one. From a Christian standpoint it is a crucial
issue in interpretation to decide whether an issue like women in ministry is
meant in a moral or wisdom sense from the scripture’s standpoint. The reader
has to decide what the intended use of the imperative mood is in biblical
texts. Commandment forms do not necessarily enjoin behaviors in a moral sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The same issue may even connect with all
three levels. Drinking is a case in point. Whereas drunkenness is a <u>moral</u>
matter (1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:9-11, <i>e.g</i>.), leaving wine alone
altogether is good <u>advice</u> (Proverbs <b>23</b>:31, <i>“Do not look on the
wine when it is red.”</i>). Paul would not touch it if it hindered <u>ministry</u>
(Romans <b>14</b>:21, <i>“It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do
anything in which your brother stumbles.”</i>). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Earlier, in calling love an ethical
principle, we were anticipating this third set of distinctions. Love governs
interpersonal behavior beyond what people normally regard as ethics in the
strict sense. Many of our earlier comments about love went beyond ethics. Love
is, of course, an ethical principle because it works no ill to a neighbor, and
therefore fulfills the law (Romans <b>13</b>:10). But, love is more than an
ethical principle, because it serves also as a wisdom and ministry principle. Ministry
surpasses moral <u>duty</u> and wise <u>circumspection</u> and goes on to <u>grace</u>.
Besides the observations made under “II” above, love helps people with needs
that lie beyond our responsibility, gives people another chance, saves them
from immorality, forgives them as enemies, avoids shedding negative influences
on them as weaker brothers, and strengthens them for service. Love can factor
readiness into the social equation and honors progress without relinquishing perfection
(John <b>16</b>:12-13; 1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:1-3). It gets us through the gray
areas as well and can cope with various kinds of relativity in social behavior
(cp. Romans <b>14</b>:23?<b> 12</b>:6?). Because love can handle so many
questions about behavior, it becomes the universal guideline for human
interaction. Love is therefore indispensable as an ethical principle because it
manages more than ethical questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            From a practical standpoint, an important
feature of love as a moral principle is that it does not require us to be sure
whether something is in fact a moral matter, because that is not the only
question in interpersonal relationships. Love can also handle wisdom and
ministry matters, along with positive commandments and matters of opinion. Some
issues are not clearly moral ones, moral ones in every case, moral ones for
everybody, or practically applicable to a person at this present level of
Christian growth. Sometimes situations present moral dilemmas, where any choice
seems to involve evil; such instances may drive us to hard decisions in a lesser-of-evils
approach. Some modern issues do not seem to have close parallels to express
commandments, apostolic precedents, or necessary inferences in Holy Writ. Love
from an honest heart is about all we can fall back on in hard cases. Love
motivates us to keep God’s commands and guides us on matters where he has not
given commands. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Consistency</u> provides a summarizing
principle for morality whether it is consistency between behavior and the
nature of the situation, between behavior and purpose, or between behavior and
promise that comes from purpose. With God consistency is between his nature and
purposes and between his purposes/promises and behavior. With mankind,
consistency is between our behavior and God’s values and purposes for us. Appropriateness
and consistency involve restricted freedom rather than positive determinism.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> We are free within a framework;
we have personal liberty to generate specific acts that fit the circumstances. Consistency
does not generate the specific acts, but limits what specific acts our free
will should choose. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the context of consistency, <u>love</u>
and <u>expediency</u> provide the positive principles for specific acts in
vertical and horizontal relationships. Love is holistic because it combines
feelings and principles and unites self and others. There needs to be a
consistency in love—principled caring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ethics normally refers to what is right
rather than wrong. In terms of the present set of categories, ethics does not
pertain especially to wisdom, grace, and ministry. Given the biblical emphasis
on love, however, one of the most important things we can say about ethics is
that ethics is not the most important thing. Holy love is what it takes to live
out fully God’s ideals for us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ethics is an interpersonal consideration. It
deals with what is directly interpersonal, what is intrapersonal, and what
grows out of interpersonal (purpose). Ethics involves internal attitude
(motives) as well as external behavior (actions) both horizontally (love for
people) and vertically (love for God). It relates to purpose because people
purpose by making choices relative to values and goals more than drives. Ethics
is interpersonal, not just legal; it involves more than a <u>conceptual
standard</u>. It is relational, not just <u>natural</u>; it operates by a
higher principle than simply what is physically and economically best. Ethics
is consistent with the existence of other persons and the future; it is not
just an emotional <u>feeling</u>, a physical <u>drive</u>, or an intuitive <u>impulse</u>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Beyond ethics, Christian ideals call for
doing what we can to improve the quality of relationship (positive), not just
to keep it from getting worse or leaving it at the level where other people’s
sins have taken it (neutral and negative). In the broadest sense, Christian
living is principled love.</span></p>

linear view there is the possibility of the truly new—something that has never
happened before. The created order then is not limited to the same old options
that have been here since time immemorial (cp. Ecclesiastes 1). Furthermore,
history is going somewhere predetermined; it is directional and purposeful, not
just operational.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span>A
moral law derives necessarily from “the nature of the case,” or nature plus
purpose. A positive command does not; it represents authoritative directive to
do something in a particular way that could be done other ways. Baptism and
observing the Lord’s Supper are examples.</span></p>

our construct, there are both determinism and freedom, which combine to form a
broad arrow with determinism on the outside and freedom inside it. In this
respect, determinism is <u>restrictive</u> in that it limits freedom. Within
boundaries set by nature, intervention/environment, and
revelation/values/purposes, people are free to choose between alternatives. People
cannot set aside nature and intervention, but they can cross over the values
boundary. Of course, with some things there is <u>positive</u> determinism,
determinism from zero up versus infinity down, a line arrow <i>vs</i>. a broad
arrow. Reflex actions and involuntary actions exemplify positive determinism,
but they fall outside ethics/morality for the very reason that no choice can be
made about them.</span></p>
