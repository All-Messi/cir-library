<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Acts <b>2</b>:38 connects
with the thesis above by making the full threefold affirmation: baptism, in the
name of Christ, and forgiveness of sins. It does not say, <i>“(Let each one of
you) repent and be baptized for the remission of sins,”</i> as sometimes
misquoted. Strictly speaking, scripture nowhere uses the phraseology <i>“baptism
for remission of sins.” </i>The point, of course, is not to disconnect baptism
from forgiveness in every way, but to conceptualize the connection exactly. Ananias
does tell Saul to be baptized and wash away his sins (Acts <b>22</b>:16). Peter
feels free even to say that baptism saves us (1 Peter <b>3</b>:21), salvation
being reconciliation from alienation caused by sin. Evidently in referring to
baptism, Titus <b>3</b>:5 declares that God <i>“saved us through the <u>washing
of regeneration</u>.”</i><sup><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>1</span></sup> Even
John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance unto/for remission of sins (Matthew <b>3</b>:2;
Mark <b>1</b>:4; Luke <b>3</b>:3; Acts <b>13</b>:24; <b>19</b>:4). Baptism texts
include the forgiveness consequence, especially when sin figures prominently in
the circumstance; hence, the deliberative question on Pentecost, <i>“What are
we going to do?” </i>(Acts <b>2</b>:37) and Ananias’ directive to <i>“the chief
of sinners,”</i> distraught over having so severely persecuted Jesus’ disciples
(Acts<b> 22</b>:16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>THE SHORT FORMULAS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Baptism statements without
consequences call attention to its fundamental meaning when they include <i>“into
Christ”</i> or a similar modifier. The mission statement for the Messianic age,
according to Matthew, enjoins baptism without indication of consequences, and
carries the expanded wording<i> “into (the name of the Father and) the Son (and
the Holy Spirit)”</i> (Matthew <b>28</b>:18-20). Everywhere else the formula shortens
to <i>“into the name of Christ” </i>or simply <i>“into Christ,”</i> as in Galatians
<b>3</b>:27. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>THE IN-BETWEEN
FACTOR</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            In the target text, Jesus
Christ stands between human act and divine consequence. There is some variety
in stating this in-between factor. The Great Commission uses the so-called
“trinitarian formula.” Acts <b>2</b>:38 has “in the name of Jesus Christ,”
identifying Jesus as Messiah. The baptism of the twelve disciples of John in
Ephesus was “in the name of the Lord Jesus” (Acts <b>19</b>:5). The Greek texts
use three different sequential prepositions after <i>baptize</i> to introduce
“the name of.”<sup><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>2 </span></sup>Although
conceivable differences might correlate with the various prepositions, for the
purposes of this study we consider all three to be approximate Greek
equivalents of the Hebrew <span lang=HE dir=RTL>לשﬦ</span><span dir=LTR></span><i><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span></i>(<i>le-</i><i>šem</i>) or perhaps <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>בשם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (<i>be-</i><i>šem</i>),
baptism “to the name of” or “baptism in/into the name of.” Instead of differences
like authority, entrance, or means, the more general common element stresses
identity, especially when <i>name of</i> appears in the pleonastic wording.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>COMPARISON WITH
OTHER BAPTISMS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>            </b>The
fundamental meaning of Christian baptism becomes clear in light of parallels with
other baptisms. (a) Paul uses the expression “baptism unto Moses” to
characterize the exodus (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:2). At the crossing of the Red
Sea, the Jewish slave people cast their lot with Moses and left Egypt behind;
they identified with Moses and the prospect of freedom he proffered. Preparatory
to Jesus’ ministry, (b) Israelites were coming to John’s ministry for a “baptism
of repentance.” In turn, the twelve disciples of John in Ephesus answered that
they were “baptized to John’s baptism.” These different descriptors signify
that people responding to John’s message were identifying with repentance as grounds
for being God’s children in contrast to relying on physical descent from
Abraham as grounds for it. Lastly, (c) Paul was grateful that he had done few
baptizings at Corinth lest people should say he was “baptizing to Paul” (1 Corinthians
<b>1</b>:14-16). The element common to baptizing to Moses, to John’s baptism, and
baptizing to Paul corresponds with the fundamental element in (d) baptizing to
Christ. The consequences differ, but the preceding constant is identification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>BAPTISM OF THE
SAVED</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>            </b>Baptism of
those already saved likewise shows that remission is not the most basic meaning
of the act. Surely God previously viewed as saved at least some Israelites
baptized by John. Surely God previously viewed as saved at least some of those
baptized by John who were later baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <i>Even
“he who knew no sin” came to John’s baptism “to fulfill all righteousness”</i>
(2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:21; Matthew <b>3</b>:13-15). Strictly speaking, baptism
conveys some meaning more fundamental than salvation from sin and the
alienation sin produces. Christian baptism identifies people with Christ, and
on the basis of that identity God gives whatever he has not already given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>THE HISTORICALLY
CONDITIONED DISCUSSION</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Despite the
above observations from scripture, historical circumstance has fostered deliberately
advocating baptism for remission. Many Christian movements connect baptism only
with (visible universal or local) institutional church membership in reaction
to the Roman Catholic view and in aversion to ritualism. Hence, it has seemed important
to show instead that water baptism belongs in the salvation process. As a
result, the meaning of baptism gets formulated in terms of existential
variables more than biblical fundamentals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Dissociating
baptism from salvation altogether stems principally from the fear of (a) advocating
salvation of works—particularly when combined with misdefining “works” in Paul.
If “water” baptism constitutes a work, it obviously cannot operate as a
precursor to forgiveness. Associating baptism with church membership gives the
ordinance an apparently significant role without conflicting with salvation <i>sola
fide</i>. As such it takes on another character as if “baptism has come in the
room of circumcision.” Another alternative makes baptism a testimony to others.
Both tacks avoid connecting it with forgiveness of sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Little direct New
Testament testimony suggests these alternatives. Only 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:13—and
that in but one way of reading the verse—puts baptism in the role of entrance
into the one body. Church membership accords also with the third consequence, which
logically follows forgiveness and the gift of the Spirit in Acts <b>2</b>. No
text seems specifically to describe baptism as a witness to others, although it
obviously can have that effect. (A person does wonder whether that significance
would invalidate private baptisms if that was its only significance.) If
anything, baptism testifies, not to other people, but to God—a meaning fairly
close to identifying with Messiah and to “calling on the name of the Lord”
(Joel <b>2</b>:32 &lt; Acts <b>2</b>:21; <b>22</b>:16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            In response to these
alternatives, insisting that baptism does indeed connect with forgiveness rests
on texts like Acts <b>2</b>:38. Consequently, one view—church membership—focuses
attention on an alternative—forgiveness of sins, and the discussion proceeds at
that level in terms of those contrasts. The trouble is that adopting a contrast
between parallel options also adopts their shared larger category, which may
then skew the issue—as in the idea that “baptism is not for church membership;
it is for remission of sins.” To explain, institutional church membership
belongs to the legal category; if baptism is put parallel to it, baptism tends
to take on a legal character as well, and the discussion gets sidetracked before
it gets started. Baptism is not a legal act; it is simply an interpersonal one
by which one person “says” something to another. The relevant contrast is
between identity with Christ and identity with some other deity, some other
leader, some philosophy. It says, <i>“I am with <u>you</u>, O Christ; I am not
a Buddhist, a Muslim, a Jew, a Taoist, a Druid, an atheist, or any other
parallel possibility.”</i> Thus, a more productive approach moves the
discussion back to first principles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Instead of
discussing baptism relative to first principles, another tack could concentrate
on clarifying what Paul means by <i>works</i> and seeking to distinguish cause
from condition. Tackling those deeper issues may prove less effective, however,
among typical Christians; hence, the interest in this study’s proposal for
understanding the ordinance—identification with Christ. It offers a positive
position rather than a reactive one, and so forestalls sliding off into an
improper meaning for “baptism for remission of sins” that might be fostered by
formulating its role over against other inadequate ones. Furthermore, it takes
the initiative in setting the terms of discussion and starts on common ground. It
moves baptism toward the front of the salvation process without giving it a
questionable role there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>DOCTRINAL VALUES
OF THIS HOLISTIC EMPHASIS</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            A surprising number
of issues surface in connection with Christian baptism. A fair number of these
“problems” disappear with baptism as personal identification with Christ. If baptism
conveys something more basic than moving people from lost to saved, (1) we can
see <u>why saved disciples of John were baptized into Christ</u>. A new
dimension had become available through the Messiah, who brought the Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (2) It gives
rationale to <u>why presumably saved Jews were baptized by John</u>. In the
coming Kingdom of God, there was a clearer emphasis on the interpersonal
character of things divine in contrast to physical lineage from Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob and identity with the political entity national Israel. In keeping
with that sentiment, John had cried out that from rocks on the ground God could
raise up children to Abraham. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(3) Baptism as
identification explains <u>why Jesus came to John’s baptism</u>. He was
identifying with the principle of relationship to God by personal repentance (motive,
attitude, and behavior) rather than physical descent or national identity. If
baptism is an act of identification, there is something left for Jesus’ baptism
to mean besides forgiveness of sins in the Sinless One (Hebrews <b>4</b>:15; <i>e.g</i>.).
It has something meaningful to do with “fulfilling all righteousness.” Consequently,
the baptism of Jesus clarifies the meaning of baptism, and at the same time the
clarified meaning explains why he was baptized by John.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>These three examples
serve a valuable role. In the legal circumstance, “hard cases make bad law,”
but unusual situations in an interpersonal setting force the issue back to
first principles. In research generally, “stray data” should not be excluded
necessarily as aberrations, bad data, false positives, and the like. They can
point to something atypical that must figure into the complete, real conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Perhaps the most
important doctrinal implication of the present thesis is that (4) <u>baptism as
personal identification with Christ more clearly avoids the taint of works</u>;
forgiveness, gift of the spirit, and “church membership” rest on the identity
that baptism marks rather than on the human act itself. The approach sidesteps
several misconceptions about “works.” “Works” in the typical Pauline<sup><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>3</span></sup> sense does not mean doing something,
doing something outward—as in James 2, doing something after salvation—as in
Ephesians <b>2</b>:9-10, or doing something formal. “Works” is not doing
something, but producing something—works in the “scientific sense.” Romans <b>3</b>:28
does not talk about “works” in just any sense, but about “works of law,” “works
under law,” “works in the context of law,” “doing” relative to a standard for
doing. The apostle makes that especially clear in Galatians <b>3</b>:10-12 when
he declares that in a legal setting “works” means personal (<b>3</b>:12)
perfection (<b>3</b>:10 &lt; Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:26 [LXX] + Leviticus <b>18</b>:5),
theoretically then unto being viewed by God as righteous (and therefore in fellowship
with him). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>So “works” means
the principle of personal perfection. That theoretical possibility is a
practical impossibility—as everyone admits, “Nobody’s perfect.” The result
would have to be “earned” rather than appealed for (1 Peter <b>3</b>:20-21)—earned
by works done by the self to produce rather than trust in another to give. This
positive alternative Paul calls “faith” (&lt; Habakkuk<b> 2</b>:4), trust in another
to view people as righteous (in this case God’s willingness to view people as
righteous on the basis of their willingness to identify with him who ­<u>is</u>
righteous). <u>Viewing people as righteous</u> is what it means to speak of
God’s <u>giving people righteousness</u> (unto salvation as reconciled
relationship to himself). In the “faith” system, one person’s act is always done
to another person rather than to maintain a standard, or law; it is done in
love to a person rather than in pride to an achievement (Romans <b>4</b>:1-5). Two
things stand between the baptism act and the forthcoming consequences: (a)
identity with Christ and (b) God’s choice to give.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Titus <b>3</b>:4-7
offers a straightforward statement that baptism is not a work. Without
explanation the text says both that we are not saved by works but by God’s
love, mercy, and grace and, on the other, hand that our salvation is “through
the water of regeneration.” It is difficult to imagine some meaning for “water
of regeneration” other than as an allusion to baptism. If indeed it does serve
as a label for baptism, there must be some significance to baptism that allows
it not to be a work even while salvation is said to be “through” it. That
significance can remain unspecified as far as this text is concerned, because
the essential point is granted: baptism is connected with salvation. Acts <b>2</b>:38
shows more exactly <u>how</u> it is connected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Though studies
of these sorts are appropriate, of course, achieving the desired results in
ministry may not readily happen this way. Nevertheless, a person would expect unnecessary
tension to disappear by stressing personal identity with Christ as the basis of
divinely gifted consequences. Sometimes ministers do well to deal with issues
pastorally, if they can, more than theologically—at least for the time being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (5) <u>Baptism as
identification with Christ removes the impulse to find another place for the
ordinance</u> in the Christian economy—like the church membership or the testimony
to others noted above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>So also (6) <u>it
should remove the inclination to read baptism statements as references to something
besides this ordinance</u>. One such interpretation takes <i>baptism</i> to
mean <u>Holy Spirit baptism</u>; hence, the expression “water” baptism to
distinguish the two baptisms. Baptism in the Holy Spirit is something that God does;
so any context that commands human action cannot have that meaning. Passages with
no implication regarding agency may contain other features that look away from
reading it as baptism in the Holy Spirit. 1 Peter <b>3</b>:21 (“baptism saves
us”) loosely compares “baptism” to Noah’s flood. John <b>3</b>:5 (“born of
water and S/spirit”) is perhaps not completely clear, but it seems like a
stretch to make “water” mean semen or amniotic fluid. Alternative proposals on
any remaining texts need not be disproved (negative burden of proof); it need
only be observed that there is no immediate, positive reason for them (positive
burden of proof); the solution lies in finding a way to get behind alternate
proposals by going elsewhere in scripture or invoking the nature of the subject
as a whole. Biblical terminology does not speak of “water” baptism as in distinction
to S/spirit baptism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>A similar point
applies to the idea that salvation occurs at the time of baptism, but that <u>God
does not contemplate the human baptism act itself</u> as part of his condition
for remission. This distinction reflects the dictum that it is not the
ordinance but the faith of the ordinance that serves as the condition for its
validity. That raises the question about what saving faith is. As to <u>kind</u>,
saving faith is not intellectual assent, but interpersonal trust; as to <u>degree</u>,
saving faith is to the extent of active expression. Such a definition comes
close to welding baptism to faith. After all, baptism in the New Testament
sense is not an outward act anyway if it involves <i>“the appeal of/for a good
conscience toward God”</i> (1 Peter <b>3</b>:21; <span lang=EL>συνειδήσεως</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>ἀγαθῆς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>ἐπερώτημα</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>εἰς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>θεόν</span>,
<i>suneidēseōs agathēs eperōtēma eis theon</i>). Faith has baptism as a subset
under it; faith is not something simply before, and parallel to, baptism—as in
intellectual assent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Unlikely views on
baptism arise because of presuppositions about works and ritualism imported
from elsewhere. While counter-responses may satisfy us, they do not usually satisfy
those who adopt other positions for theological reasons. If remission, and so
on, are divinely bestowed on the basis of the identity indicated by obedience
in baptism, such attempts should disappear, because they are no longer needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (7) <u>Baptism as
identification with Christ should relieve the inclination to create a new special
act in place of baptism</u>. The custom of “asking Jesus into your heart” fills
the void that baptism leaves when extracted from the series. Actually, that
idea comes close in meaning to an <i>“appeal of/for a good conscience,” </i>but
in 1 Peter <b>3</b>:21 that value is associated with baptism, not invoked aside
from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>As with
processes generally, people want to specify a point they can regard as the
“time when” of their salvation. Obviously in some ways salvation is a process,
but the propensity for collapsing process to a point involves contrasting before
and after—much as a handshake establishes a point in time that finalizes an
agreement. In this respect, identifying a “point when” in a process is more for
the person’s benefit than God’s; but that does not give the right to institute
a new ritual for that purpose, particularly since one already exists in part,
we take it, for that very reason.<sup><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>4</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (8) Speaking of <u>baptism
as identification with Messiah eliminates the need to find places where </u><u><span
lang=EL>εἰς</span> means “in</u>” so as to circumvent Acts <b>2</b>:38 as
evidence for associating baptism with forgiveness. The expression <i>baptism</i>
<i><u>for</u></i> [<span lang=EL>εἰς</span>, <i>eis</i>,<i> </i>“into/unto”] <i>remission
</i>grates on evangelical sensitivities because, as discussed above, it puts a formal
human act logically before remission whereas salvation has to be by “faith.” Something
must be done. For systematic reasons, the Matthew<b> 26</b>:28 parallel cannot
be allowed to justify a purpose value for the same phrase here. (Jesus’ pouring
out his blood “for remission of sins [<span lang=EL>εἰς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>ἄφεσιν</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>ἁμαρτιῶν</span>, <i>eis
aphesin hamart</i><i><span lang=EL>ι</span>ōn</i>]” must be a purpose/result
construction.) Any other observations from elsewhere likewise cannot suffice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>One counter
claim is that <span lang=EL>εἰς</span><span lang=EL> </span>in our passage is a
synonym for <span lang=EL>ἐν</span><span lang=EL> </span>(<i>en, </i>“in”). Baptism
done “in” the remission of sins would then come logically after the remitting
and so would fit with being an “outward sign of a (previous) inward grace,”
with being a “testimony to others,” or with baptism for visible “church
membership.” In some places, admittedly, <span lang=EL>εἰς</span> could mean
“in.”<sup><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>5</span></sup> We can also agree that <span
lang=EL>εἰς</span><span lang=EL> </span>is derived from <span lang=EL>ἐν</span>
and so may reflect its origins occasionally. An interpreter should be cautious,
however, taking a minority meaning for a word in order to bring a particular
text into conformity with a general belief. Additionally, usage more than
derivation determines meaning—usage in the immediate context, the context of
subject matter (nature of the case), and the context of contemporary usage on
other subjects. In short, it is less satisfying to base interpretation on fine
distinctions between terms and phrases. A safer, more cogent method appeals to
flow of thought as primary proof and invokes fine distinctions as confirmatory
evidence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>As it turns out,
baptism in the name of Christ “on account of” the forgiveness of sins could be
taken to mean that forgiveness happens before being in Christ: <i>“be baptized
. . . in the name of Jesus Messiah in/because-of remission of sins.”</i> The
crucial element (“in the name of Jesus Christ”) gets blurred in the picture,
because concern is focused forward to the next phrase. In the layout of the
text, “in the name of Christ” precedes “unto/in remission of sins”; so the “into-in”
distinction not only becomes irrelevant, it gets settled in favor of “unto”;
otherwise, the remission would be irrespective of Christ. Highlighting the more
basic value of Christian baptism affords a practical solution to evaluating some
arguments most people on both sides of this issue are not especially well-equipped
to handle, because discussing them calls for a fairly mature awareness of Greek
usage and literature in addition to other hermeneutical niceties and
theological distinctions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (9) <u>Baptism into
Christ stands more clearly at odds with salvation flowing through the institutional
church</u>. The present construct recognizes that baptism is an interpersonal
act between candidate and Christ, with consequences given directly by God
himself rather than through grace somehow dispensed indirectly by delegated
authority operating as agents of an institution. By their very nature, grace,
love, and faith-trust are interpersonal acts on two sides of a personal
relationship, which means they cannot be dispensed by legal authority or by
proxies. That is the point of Paul’s appeal to Habakkuk <b>2</b>:4: <i>“The
just shall have life by trust/faith”</i> (Romans <b>1</b>:17-<b>5</b>:5; Galatians
<b>3</b>).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (10) <u>Baptism as
personal identification with Christ means that unimmersed believers and those
baptized as infants need not be regarded as lost in order to legitimize baptizing
them “for remission of sins</u>.” If baptism were directly for remission of
sins and such believers should choose not to accept “believer’s baptism,” their
easy inference would be that we must be considering them lost and that they should
agree. So the inference would seemingly apply both to the administrator’s and
the candidate’s take on the matter. Stressing the more basic approach to the
meaning of baptism removes us from feeling obligated for consistency’s sake to form
even unvoiced conclusions about someone else’s status before God—particularly
about someone whose life quality and devotion to God may be better than ours. We
are unqualified to render verdict and have no adequate scriptural basis for
doing it. But the situation is such that we can still present them with the
need to personally identify themselves with Jesus in Christian baptism. (Note
the similar issue regarding age of accountability below.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Another, less
satisfactory tack on this matter says that unimmersed believers may not be
lost, but they do become responsible for new light. (a) There is no reason,
however, for them to believe that the “new light” we are shedding is any better
than what they received from devout parents and ministers who loved them as
much or more than they have any reason to believe we do—parents and ministers
committed to Christ as much or more than they have any reason to believe we are.
Instead of recognizing us as teaching the way of the Lord more perfectly, we
may look more like divisive, narrow-minded competitors than like people giving greater
light. Besides, (b) if they do not respond to our teaching, they are now in
that condition of greater light without response to it. Does that leave them lost
in our minds and leave them supposing that we must think so too? The
ramifications for Christian unity start coming to the fore; they signal concern
for the adverse effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (11) <u>Baptism as
identification with Christ does not even require thinking of the previously
unevangelized</u> as necessarily always lost in order to legitimize baptizing
them into Christ. We simply have them identify with Christ in this fashion
without comment on their concerns about unevangelized ancestors. We do not know
how God plans to deal with the vast majority of mankind in history and in our
own day; we can say that however he decides to deal with them will be
appropriate. Even we can imagine scenarios on how that might occur. For
purposes of self-consistency, we may gain help from Romans <b>2</b> and the
cases of saved people in the patriarchal (1 Peter <b>4</b>:6) and Mosaic ages
(Hebrews <b>9</b>:15), but we do not, and do not need to, understand specifically
how, as regards salvation, God regards those who can only <i>“feel after him
and find him”</i> (Acts <b>17</b>:27; cp. <b>14</b>:16-17). Sanctified
imagination comes in tentatively to get through the issue well enough that
uncertainty does not stifle obedience (cp. faithful Abraham regarding the
sacrifice of Isaac as per Genesis <b>22</b>:5 [“<i>we will return to you”</i>]
and Hebrews <b>11</b>:17-19). All we need declare is that God figures all
salvation relative to Christ—whether before or after him, whether known or not
by people God might decide to save—and that it makes sense so to affirm while
identifying people with God through Christ in Christian baptism here and now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>PRACTICAL VALUES
OF THIS HOLISTIC EMPHASIS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            No sharp distinction lies
between doctrinal and practical values of this baseline approach to baptism,
but the values noted below certainly illustrate practical considerations. Perhaps
most importantly (12) <u>baptism as identification with Christ stresses what we
are giving more than what we are getting</u>. Because of who Jesus is,
identification with him entails much more than a sense of association,
appreciation, and kinship. Since this personal relationship pertains to One who
loves us, identification involves commitment to him as a person—in addition to
what he stands for or any agenda he carries forward. Besides, this is not a
relationship between equals. His being superior calls for deference to him. Since
he is leader, it requires allegiance to him. Since this leader calls for
ultimate allegiance, identification involves self-sacrifice—giving that last
measure of devotion for him if need be—as in taking up our own cross and
following him (Matthew<b> 16</b>:24). So baptism is a performative act, an act
by which we say something, an act that in this case signifies identification,
commitment, and ultimate allegiance to Christ—something total, permanent, and
exclusive. By prioritizing identification over consequences, we reflect the
attitude of Job, <i>“Though he slay me, I will trust him”</i> (<b>13</b>:15). By
emphasizing self-giving over receiving, we embrace the new birth with its higher
frame of reference (John <b>3</b>:3-7), the resurrected lifestyle in pursuit of
Christ (Romans <b>6</b>:1-11), and transcendent living above this-worldly interests
(Colossians <b>3</b>:1-4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (13) <u>Baptism as
identification with Christ guarantees the validity of baptism even on the basis
of initial levels of faith</u>. Having room for growth does not vitiate the
preliminary degrees of perception in interpersonal matters. When a person
identifies with another person, the identity is real and valid at all levels
and degrees. It allows as real and acceptable a child’s sense of belonging to parents
despite not knowing what will come into the picture later. On the analogy of New
Testament baptisms performed soon after initial proclamation, we need not worry
about achieving advanced understanding before entering into Christ. The
Philippian jailor and his family could not have known more than the basics
(Acts <b>16</b>:23-34). It does not take a lot to grasp the essential message
of the Christian faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (14) <u>Baptism into
Christ reduces the concern about determining the age of accountability</u> and
consequently the age of candidacy for baptism. Strictly speaking, God does not
have to view a child as lost before it makes sense to us to baptize him into
Christ. The young person identifies with Christ regardless of whether
(theoretically) he has done any sin against or has any sin imputed by God. The
situation compares to Jesus’ identifying via John’s baptism with remission
based on repentance even though he had no sin to repent of. With the young
person, this line of thought is a major gain since we cannot know God’s mind on
this matter in this person’s case. As with Christ so also with young people,
the young person theoretically does not have to be lost before he can identify with
Christ. Under the typical reconstruction of the situation, baptizing too soon
is pointless; baptizing too late is risky. Removing a hard-wired connection
between baptism and salvation (by understanding that baptism more basically
means identification with Christ) should ease the urgency that pushes baptism <u>too
early</u>. Practical considerations can let age of candidacy vary, especially
since what a person lacks in “birth” may be made up for in growth, and what is
later than necessary is retroactive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (15) <u>Identification
with Christ eliminates the concern over postbaptismal sins</u>. In this case
there is an impulse to push baptism <u>too late</u>. That concern operates as
if remission of sins were a legal process that the worshipper has to redo from
time to time to produce the result needed again from time to time. There is no
reason to delay baptism as long as possible (as the ancients were wont to do) in
order to reduce the concern for sins committed afterwards. As the Hebrew writer
observes, the lack of efficacy in certain procedures is evident from the fact
that they have to be repeated (<b>10</b>:2). By their very nature, however,
personal relationships are intended to be permanent so that their origination need
not be re-enacted periodically. What happens is essentially timeless. As John
puts it, <i>“The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin”</i> (1 John<b> 1</b>:7).
Remission rests on Christ’s continuously being who he is and God’s continuously
being who he is. We are called on to be continually what we are—identified with
Christ—with its implications. Baptism expresses unity with Christ; it does not <i>per
</i>se erase sins. Baptism ties into a continuous relationship; it does not
remove individual sins as they arise. So to speak, identity with Christ saves
from sin, not from sins. And baptized believers do not have to remain sinless
to remain in relationship with God. That would be the Galatianism that Paul
fought so hard against early on. We would be operating as if we were back under
law—which would re-activate the principle of personal perfection, and Christ
would profit us nothing (Galatians <b>2</b>:21; <b>5</b>:2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (16) <u>Baptism as
identification with Christ should foster Christian unity</u> with evangelicals generally.
A sizable portion of the believing community has held at arm’s length those who
associate “water baptism” with remission of sins. Those who characteristically speak
of baptism for remission of sins bear partial responsibility for false
impressions and subsequent attitudes. And it is not just hearers who get misled;
the speakers may mislead themselves into something beyond their right to
declare. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'> (17) <u>This
emphasis may actually bring clarification and correction to advocates of
baptism as having soteriological significance</u>, and help avoid
misconception, misstatement, and overstatement. Theological drift and
crystallization over time can accompany a slogan. Making “baptism for remission
of sins” the standard expression may make the talk the father to the thought. Spin-off
expressions like “necessary for salvation” and “essential to salvation” increase
the chance of misunderstanding in speaker and hearer alike. “Essential to
salvation” means that baptism belongs <u>in</u> the saving process rather than
after it or aside from it, but the ambiguous term <i>essential</i> sounds like
salvation cannot exist without it. Similarly, “necessary for salvation” easily
says too much—like disallowing the validity of death-bed repentance or the lack
of salvation because of death on the way to the river or some other exceptional
circumstance. When people want to talk about such seemingly impertinent contingencies,
they are simply trying to determine what these unbiblical expressions are meant
to say. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (18) <u>Baptism as
identification with Christ forestalls legalistic inferences that go with
baptism into the church—the idea that there is no salvation outside the church,
the clerical efficacy of ordinances/sacraments, or certain reasons given for
paedobaptism</u>. The richer formulation partakes of the interpersonal
character and concerns of Christianity as a worldview. Consequently, baptism says
something to Christ: in it people truly “call on the name of the Lord” like
Paul of old (Joel <b>2</b>:32 = Acts<b> 2</b>:21; <b>22</b>:16). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>SOME GENERAL
VALUES OF THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            With Acts <b>2</b>:38
read in its completeness, (19) <u>we need not get so bogged down in complex
issues</u>. It combines “baptized into Christ” with God’s giving whatever he
deems appropriate. Moreover, “the wayfaring masses” are not so likely to “err”
in this simple “way of the Lord” as they are when drawn into involved
theological and linguistic distinctions (Isaiah <b>35</b>:8). People make
better sense of matters that follow closely from general principles, and they
are more likely to respond to the God’s call when the message makes sense to
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            With Acts <b>2</b>:38
read in its completeness, (20) <u>we are afforded a framework of theory for
dealing with issues on which scripture does not speak</u>: age of baptizing
young people, baptism of the physically or mentally impaired, of young people
with disbelieving parents, of the terminally ill, of the criminally
incarcerated, of Eskimos and desert dwellers, of a former Christian after a long-time
apostasy, requests for re-baptisms, and so on. Interpersonal relationship
naturally involves a flexibility that legal, hypostatic, and metaphysical
constructs do not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            As it turns out, Acts<b>
2</b>:38 serves as a prime text about baptism for a different reason than the
conventional one. On the one hand, the Great Commission and Galatians <b>3</b>:27
connect baptism with Christ while Acts <b>22</b>:16, 1 Peter <b>3</b>:21, and
Titus <b>3</b>:5 (Ephesians <b>5</b>:26? Hebrews <b>10</b>:22) connect it with
salvation from sin. (“Baptism saves us” serves as a short for the full idea.) Acts
<b>2</b>:38 offers the clearest statement of the combination, not only because
it gives all three aspects of the process, but because it gives such a crisp
statement about their relative places in the process. As the first proclamation
of the gospel in accomplished reality, that clarity offers a particularly
useful starting point for an understanding of baptism and of salvation itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>            </b><sup><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>3</span></sup>Crucial to the proper understanding of
“works” is seeing that the word does not carry the same significance in all
cases, because different formal relationships with “faith” adjust its specific
meaning. In Paul we are justified by faith <u>without</u> works (Romans<b> 3</b>:27-28;
<b>4</b>:5-8; <b>9</b>:30-32a; <b>11</b>:6; Galatians <b>2</b>:16; <b>3</b>:2-5;
Ephesians <b>2</b>:8-9); in James <b>2</b>:14-26 we are justified by faith <u>and</u>
works; in John<b> 6</b>:29 faith is regarded <u>as</u> a work. Three formal
relationships require different contents. The reader has to adjust meaning to
fit context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><sup><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>4</span></sup>At this point, we may also note that
“confirmation” represents another non-scriptural institution brought in to fill
the felt need, not necessarily as a time-when of salvation, but as a time-when
for personalizing commitment to Christ. The issue here more specifically stems
from the practice of infant baptism in which concepts like surrogate faith (of
parents or God parents), anticipatory faith, or even infant faith are replaced
or realized by personal, contentful faith in the rite of confirmation. Suffice
it to say, the personalness of identity with Christ is already present as the
most basic meaning of baptism. Moving baptism back to infancy disconnects it
from personal identity with Christ; doing so creates a need to bring it in
later when personal, contentful faith becomes possible.<sup><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'> </span></sup>(We have coined the expression
“contentful faith” here to label the kind of faith a young person can have in
contrast to Luther’s concept of infant faith.)</p>
