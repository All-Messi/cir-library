<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The very fact that baptism exists shows
that salvation is not by works of law, works in a <u>legal</u> sense, works in
a legal context, acts that have some legal value. Furthermore, the very
existence of baptism shows that salvation is not by human effort relative even
to an <u>interpersonal</u> standard of behavior, which, as in law, is also a
perfection standard. To make this claim convincing, we must show that baptism
is not primarily for bringing about entrance into the institutional <u>church</u>
or for communicating to other <u>people</u> that we have decided to follow
Jesus. For present purposes, that point is sufficiently shown by the biblical expression
“baptism into Christ,” not “baptism into the church” or some wording that
indicates testimony to other people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            However important it is that people begin
to change their ways from what does not meet divine expectancy, the New
Testament proclamation is not that people begin to act differently. This “conversion”
motif is one George MacDonald emphasizes and one very much needed in the
context of the totally passive salvation proclaimed in the Scottish
hyper-Calvinism of his day. But the apostolic proclamation was that people turn
to God properly understood as personal rather than material, and so forth (Acts
<b>17</b>:22-29). It was a matter of turning to <u>God</u> (Acts <b>15</b>:19, <i>e.g</i>.).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Baptism must be interpersonal in meaning
since it is not for church membership or legally causal for any result (and
certainly not somehow part of a <u>metaphysical</u> or <u>nature</u> process). The
interpersonal category is the only basic category left. Christianity's central
call is more than a call to a devout and holy life. It is more a call to
fellowship with the true God, whose real nature revealed in, and by, the <u>person</u>
of Jesus Christ calls for that devout and holy llfe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Baptism is an <u>act of identification</u>
with Christ as a way of identifying with God “the Father,” who appointed Christ
as the object of identification. He is so because he is the only manifest
extension of the Father. Christ and the Father are at one in that they stand together
on the other side of the personal relationship with us, and we are called on to
identity with that other side of the relationship—as happens in any
reconciliation process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Baptism is (1) an <u>act of communication</u>
by which people say something; it is a <u>performative act</u>. It is (2) an <u>act
of commitment</u> first to the God (through Christ) as a <u>person</u> to the
exclusion of all parallel alternatives, and expresses a <u>sense of identity</u>
with God. In this case it becomes a commitment to (3) God's/Christ's <u>lordship</u>
since this is not a relationship between equals. Only then is baptism a
commitment to (4) the Lord's <u>values</u>, <u>purposes</u>, and consequent <u>behavior</u>.
Lastly, it is a commitment to (5) the <u>extent</u> of obedience that Christ exemplified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We are not called on simply to change. We
are called into fellowship with God. Fellowship with him through reconciliation
is the bigger issue, the more basic, more ultimate, more central, more
important issue; the first consideration—or whatever figure we choose for the
main consideration between people and God. Other matters like morality,
worship, fellowship, ministry, evangelism, wisdom, and doctrinal understanding
of many sorts take their place as needed and possible logically after this
initial matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The fact that baptism even exists, then,
shows that there is something more in Christian concern beyond other necessary
matters like behavioral change. There is something more than the other things
we see Christianity address. That bigger something is fellowship with God
through Jesus Christ. <u>That</u> is what baptism expresses.</span></p>
