style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Not all systems are alike. They often
operate in respect to different kinds of matters, but the main contrast lies in
the kinds of connectors in them that bind actions to results. Below are three
types of systems that illustrate this diversity. We outline them here in order
to clarify what causes people to differ so intensely about the role of
Christian baptism in the salvation process. Basically what happens is that at
various points in their total understanding of baptism they are shifting
baptism back and forth between different systems without realizing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In America, when someone wants to pass on
property to other people after his death, he must sign his name to a document
that specifies who receives what. He must put his signature on it in the
presence of official witnesses and the matter is arranged. The reason there is
a connection between that piece of paper and the ownership of that property by
some specified friend or relative is that the <u>authority</u> of the law makes
it so and makes it occur.</span></p>

window and turns a bucket of water upside down, the barking dog below gets wet.
A natural <u>force</u> made the connection between the upside-down bucket and
the wet dog.       </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A neighbor may offer to mow your lawn
while you are on vacation if you will stop and visit his aging parents in a
town along your route. The reason there is a connection between your visiting
his parents and his mowing your lawn is that he made a <u>choice</u> to connect
these acts this way. In this case he has in effect said, “If you do me a favor,
I’ll do you a favor.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The biggest difficulty in understanding
baptism comes from confusing the type of system Christianity is with other
types of systems Christianity is not. People experience this confusion first
because they do not consciously remember that these different kinds of systems
do exist. Secondly, they do not consciously remember that different kinds of
things make these different systems run. The points of similarity overshadow
their crucial differences. Actions and results occur in all three systems, and
actions plus results normally occur in a sequence in all of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            But since the kinds of connectors differ,
the kinds of connections differ, so that the meaning of the actions that
precede these connections differ, and the manner in which the result comes also
differs. Consequently, the type of necessity for the actions themselves differ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Applying these observations to the meaning
and necessity of Christian baptism is crucial. Baptism is an act and remission
is a result. Confusing the kind and manner of connection between baptism and
remission leads to misunderstanding the type of meaning and necessity the
baptism act has. The confusion stems from reading this interpersonal sequence
as if it were a natural or legal one. The confusion unconsciously transfers to
Christian baptism the kind and manner of connection and the type of meaning and
necessity that belongs to the other two systems.</span></p>
