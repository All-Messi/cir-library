<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The wise policy is to let candidates make their
own decision about rebaptism; after all, baptism is <u>their</u> obedience to
God, not ours. Nevertheless, people usually take their cue from those they have
come to trust on religious matters. For these reasons we will not always be
able to leave the issue in the hands of candidates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The predominate opinion has been that
rebaptism is not necessary even for those who understood their previous baptism
as a testimony to other believers or as the way of entering the visible body of
Christ on earth. That opinion seems wise for reasons like the following.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (1) Even the “baptistic” view understands
that baptism has to do with Jesus Christ—and with everything that naturally
relates to him. Baptism has to do with Christ rather than Buddha, Mohammed,
Reverend Moon, Moses, John the Baptist, <i>etc</i>. It is a Christian act, not
a Jewish, Hindu, or Satanic one. People understand that baptism relates to
Christ and that in some fashion he relates to all benefits that come to us who
are in him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (2) Baptism is <u>God’s</u> act rather
than ours. Its meaning is not determined by the candidate or the administrator,
but by the commander. We take it, then, that when we do what God tells us as a
condition for his fulfilling his promise, God gives us the benefits he promised
regardless of how exactly we saw the connection between our obedience and the
benefit. The act is not the cause of salvation; God is the cause. The important
thing is that we obey him. A candidate knows what Christian salvation entails. Our
view differs from some people’s view as to where it is in the series of human
responses that God begins to count a person as his child—at the time of the
change of heart or at the time of baptism. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In a way, reconciliation between persons
does not have a terribly specific time when it occurs. In fact, the reason for
a formal rite like baptism is to focalize into a point what is actually a
process. So to speak, a rite of passage exists for psychological purposes—to
help us see ourselves in a new state, that is in this case, in a new
association with God. Baptism is for our benefit rather than for accomplishing
the result; God gives the result. Baptism is not part of a legal transaction
because reconciliation is not a legal process for it to be part of;
consequently, baptism does not accomplish the result nor does it have the kind
of time-when that putting an insurance policy into effect does. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Salvation is reconciliation, an overcoming
of estrangement between persons—God and people. Since reconciliation is an
interpersonal process, it is accomplished by interpersonal means; so we must
understand it in that sense, an act that one person does toward another. Formal
acts can exist in a legal processes as well; but since reconciling persons is
not a legal process, baptism does not have legal characteristics. That fact
impacts how we handle the rebaptism issue. Rather than being rebaptized, we can
re-understand what our previous baptism meant. Re-interpreting it can be an
alternative to rebaptizing them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, (3) it is not wise to connect
baptism <u>specifically</u> with the forgiveness of sins. Its design is broader
than that one issue even though forgiveness is a prominent issue that is basic
to the gift of the Spirit and membership in the body. Baptism identifies us
with Jesus Christ (see related essays) rather than with any one specific
benefit that comes from that identity. As an act of identification with him,
baptism involves commitment to the values, purposes, and lordship of Christ as
much as reception of forgiveness, the gift of the Spirit, and church
membership. We see baptism as pertaining to up-front identification with Christ
rather than with some subsequent specific whether that specific is church
membership or forgiveness of sins. We are baptized into <u>Christ</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We also should not connect baptism <u>directly</u>
with the forgiveness of sins--or with any other benefit, for that matter. Between
baptism and the benefits stands both (a) identity with Christ and (b) God’s
choice to forgive, <i>etc</i>. Considering baptism as having a direct
connection with any of these benefits leaves Christ out of the picture and
changes the obedience into a legal work rather than an interpersonal act of
trust in another.</span></p>
