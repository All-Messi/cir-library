<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The following presentation gives the
author’s understanding of Christian baptism even though it attempts to
represent fairly a wider movement. What I am saying here may at first sound
different to brethren from my background. That difference comes in part from
the attention given to framework of thought and structure of presentation. We
have tried to achieve wholeness, cohesiveness, and clarity by giving overt
expression to our presuppositions. The difference comes also from the fact that
there is some diversity in the movement, which is natural enough in a
free-church heritage the size of this one. Unity through restoration assumes
the desire to adjust toward a more New Testament understanding. Hopefully, this
treatment will synthesize ideas and sharpen and improve what we believe and
practice in regard to Christian baptism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We attempt here not only to describe a
viewpoint, but to provide biblical rationale for it and to contrast it with
apparently foreign and incompatible alternatives. Such a task is formidable
because so many doctrinal issues surface in connection with this ordinance, and
so many tacit assumptions become visible in the practice of baptism.</span></p>

Covenant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The <u>nature</u> of the new
covenant sets the nature of its ordinances. When Jeremiah prophesied the coming
of a covenant, he not only indicated that there would be <u>another</u>
covenant, but that it would be another <u>kind</u> of covenant. It would not be
like the one Yahveh made with Israel at Sinai after the exodus (<b>31</b>:31-34).
This time God would write his law on the hearts of his people rather than on <i>“tables
of stone</i>,<i>”</i> as Paul later put it (2 Corinthians<b> 3</b>:7). Instead
of an impersonal law that could be expressed on stone, a personal revelation
and abiding influence were to come that persons would internalize <i>“in their
hearts.”</i> Every act that arises from a fundamental category participates in
the nature of that category. In an interpersonal system baptism and communion
are interpersonal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        We call the new covenant “interpersonal”
because it addresses active relationship between persons in contrast to legal
function, natural process, rational process, and so forth. Jeremiah’s prophecy
spoke of “knowing” the Lord. “Knowing” God means more than knowing about him or
believing he exists because knowing about God does not especially bring in the
sin problem and its solution. Sin is something that happens between persons
relative to their shared values and purposes. The New Testament discussion of the
covenant that came treats it in terms that belong to personal relationship,
particularly in contrast to legal systems. Paul’s familiar comments in Romans <b>3-4</b>,
Galatians <b>3</b>, and elsewhere highlight the contrast between faith, grace,
promise, reckoning, reconciliation, life, love, spirit, on one hand, and works,
law, debt, flesh, on the other. Christian ordinances belong to a grace-faith
covenant; so they are interpersonal.</span></p>

Covenant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The <u>purpose</u> of the
covenant also sets the nature of its ordinances. Interpersonal consequences
come from interpersonal antecedents. The result of the new economy would be
fellowship: Yahweh would be their God and they would be his people. Their sins
would no longer stand between them and him because he would no longer remember
their sins against them (cp. Hebrews <b>8</b>:6-<b>10</b>:18).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> In the place where it was said
they were not his people, they would be called sons of the living God (Hosea <b>1</b>:10-11).
They would have personal relationship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        After speaking of the new
covenant in 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>, Paul moves ahead in <b>5</b>:17-21 to
describe God’s purpose in that covenant and in calling men to be his
ambassadors. The apostle calls this work a “ministry of reconciliation” in
which people are entreated to be reconciled to God through Christ. “Reconciliation”
implies “alienation,” and both terms address interpersonal matters. Estrangement
ceases if the trespasses that caused it are removed. Sins are removed by no
longer reckoning them against the sinner because he is in Christ, the Sinless
One. The reconciling purpose of the new covenant establishes interpersonal
meaning for its ordinances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Finally, the <u>source</u> of
the ordinances sets the nature of the ordinances. The origin of any act
determines its nature because an act has the character of what motivates it. Antecedent
must be amenable to consequence. Acts are “after their kind” in keeping with
the law of harvest: people reap what they sow (Galatians <b>6</b>:7-9; cp. <b>5</b>:13-25).
What is born of flesh is flesh; what is born of spirit is spirit (John <b>3</b>:6;
cp. 1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:50?). Likewise, what is of faith is faith. Since
baptism and the Lord’s Supper arise from faith, they have the character of
faith—they are interpersonal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              The Great Commission
sets the understanding of baptism by establishing its meaning at a broad level.
Baptism identifies a person with <u>Father-Son-Spirit</u> (Matthew <b>28</b>:19).
According to several passages in Acts and the epistles, baptism identifies a
person with the Lord Jesus (Acts <b>8</b>:16; <b>10</b>:48; <b>19</b>:5; Romans
<b>6</b>:3; Galatians <b>3</b>:27). These statements parallel other expressions
about identification with <u>Moses</u> (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:2), with <u>Paul</u>
(1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:13-14), and with <u>John’s baptism</u>. The twelve in
Ephesus who had been baptized into John’s baptism were then baptized into
Christ (Acts <b>19</b>:2-5), which implies that the two baptisms have parallel
significances, that is, parallel identifications. When people are in Christ, they
are “new creatures [creations]” (2 Corinthians<b> 5</b>:17); they have a new
identity along with everything that entails. Baptism is a <b>rite of passage</b>
into Christ; it is an <b>initiatory rite</b> into a personal relationship with
him; it is an <b>oath of induction</b> into a new identity. And so we move on to
what that new identity encompasses.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Identification with
Christ implies meanings associated with that identification. Within the meaning
of baptism lie certain implied commitments. In baptism a person commits himself
to the <u>values</u> and <u>purposes</u> of Christ, values and purposes that
transcend a material frame of reference. They are spiritual not fleshly,
interpersonal not impersonal, centered above the individuals not in them. They
stress invisible realities that are eternal, not visible ones that are
temporary.                                                          </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Living above a <u>material
lifestyle</u> appears in two images associated with baptism. First, Paul
pictures the transcendent orientation as a <u>resurrected lifestyle</u> (Romans
<b>6</b>) and <u>ascended lifestyle</u> (Colossians <b>2</b>:12 + <b>3</b>:1-17).
The death, burial, resurrection, ascension of Jesus constitutes the most
distinctive event in his life because he alone resurrected to heaven never to
die again. Baptism appropriately identifies us with Jesus by loosely picturing
that unique event. But baptism does more than dramatically re-enact what <u>Jesus</u>
did. It makes a statement about what <u>we</u> are going to do and what <u>we</u>
aspire to become. It is a performative act. Psychologically in baptism we
crucify our fleshly orientation and bury it, and we adopt a higher orientation—a
resurrected one, an ascended one that is “above all that.” Paul says we are “united
with” Christ<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> in this
likeness of his death and resurrection. By “uniting” with him in baptism, we
formally “identify” with him there, and our identity with him means we our “new
creatures [creations].” Since baptism is immersion as to form, it bears a
formal “likeness” to his death and resurrection.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>5</span> To sum up in one statement, baptism is a <u>formal
likeness</u> of a <u>historical analogy</u> to a <u>lifestyle transformation</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Adopting a transcendent
lifestyle means starting over from that changed perspective. During his
discussion with Nicodemus (John <b>3</b>), Jesus pictures in a second way this
starting over from above. He calls it rebirth, birth from above, birth from
spirit rather than from flesh. He calls for a <u>reborn lifestyle</u> (<b>3</b>:19-21;
cp. Titus <b>3</b>:5), one concerned with faith (<b>3</b>:16ff) and spirit, not
biological descent, national identity, or even physical life (John <b>3</b>:13-15).
Since baptism takes place in water, we are psychologically “<u>born</u> of
water” when we commit to a new way of life in the higher kingdom (<b>3</b>:5),
which is not of this world (<b>18</b>:36). <i>“Being born of water” </i>expresses
a new identification with the spiritual values and transcendent purposes (cp. 2
Corinthians<b> 5</b>:16-17) of the Savior who is <i>“lifted up” </i>(<b>3</b>:14),
as it were, and draws all nationalities to himself (John<b> 3</b>:16-17; <b>12</b>:32). 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              As we are using the term
here, <u>identification</u> means more than an appreciation for Christ or a
sense of association with him. Identification involves <u>commitment</u> to him
and his values and <u>participation</u> in his purposes and work. Baptism is a <b>pledge
of allegiance </b>to Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In relation to a new
interpersonal covenant, baptism arises from personal responses like trust and
repentance, expresses identification with Jesus Christ, and by extension
commitment to his values and purposes. Because of that (1) <u>identity</u> and
its implied commitments, God (2) <u>chooses</u> to (3) <u>give</u> certain
consequences we need. He chooses to fulfill his covenant promise to forgive
sin, to give fellowship with his Spirit, and to add us to Christ’s body, the
church. Two things stand between antecedent responses and consequent blessings:
<u>identity</u> with Christ and God’s <u>choice</u> to fulfill previous
promises. Furthermore, these consequences come to us by <u>gift</u> from the
other Person. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Inside of being identified
with Christ and committed to him lie the benefits of that new identity. Since
baptism formally expresses the identification from which these benefits come,
scripture can speak of those benefits in connection with baptism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    Salvation is
primarily reconciliation back into fellowship with God (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:17-21).
Lostness means alienation from God because of personal sin. Salvation, then, means
solving the sin problem. In the new covenant, God no longer remembers our sins
against us. Salvation deals with sin more than sins because it deals with our
overall <i>character</i> more than our individual acts and our estranged <i>state</i>,
which by metonymy is called sin. We <u>come to be considered</u> righteous more
than <u>come to be</u> righteous; we come to be <u>considered righteous</u>
through identity with Christ who <u>is righteous</u>. Personal responses that
identify us with Christ scripture associates with salvation itself. Since
baptism stands among those responses, scripture connects it with forgiveness
and salvation even though it is a formal act: <i>“He that believes and is
baptized will be saved”</i> (Mark <b>16</b>:16); <i>“Arise and be baptized and
wash away your sins, calling on his name”</i> (Acts <b>22</b>:16); <i>“ . . .
which after a true likeness now saves you—baptism”</i> (1 Peter<b> 3</b>:31). Similarly,
John’s baptism is directly associated with forgiveness in Mark<b> 1</b>:4 and
Luke <b>3</b>:3.<b> </b>In keeping with the fact that it relates to forgiveness
of sin, baptism is like cleansing (Ephesians<b> 5</b>:26; Titus<b> 3</b>:5),
and its element is water.</span></p>

Pentecost Peter included <i>“the gift of the Spirit&quot;</i> among God’s gifts
to those he commanded to identify with Christ through repentance and baptism. We
understand the gift of the Spirit in this case to be the gift that the Spirit
is rather than a gift that comes from him. Commonly called <i>“the indwelling
gift of the Spirit</i>,<i>”</i> this gift consists primarily of interpersonal
relationship with God in the person of the Spirit because renewed relationship
can accompany forgiveness of what brought alienation. No decision needs to be
made at this level between natural and supernatural involvements. The
natural-supernatural variable relates to particulars of each conversion and its
setting. The expression <i>“gift of the Spirit” </i>evidently<i> </i>equals the
other expressions <i>“baptism in the Spirit” </i>and <i>“earnest of the Spirit.”</i></span></p>

conversion includes God’s adding together the increasing number of the ones

who identify with the one Lord to create the one body—the <i>“new united
mankind”</i> (Ephesians <b>4</b>:4-6; <b>2</b>:11-18). Those whom God adds to
Christ’s body are the same ones he saves and gives his Spirit. No intended
distinction exists between the “invisible” and visible church—or, for that
matter, between the universal church and local churches taken collectively. No
distinction exists in the time or conditions for entering the one and the
other. We enter the salvation of Christ and the body of Christ at the same time
and on the same conditions.</span></p>

anything more than conditionally appropriate to the consequences God provides. Baptism
has no more, no less, and no other than this same kind of function. Repentant
faith expressed in baptism identifies with Christ; identity with Christ is the
condition for all consequences God gives. So to speak, <i>“identify with Christ
and all these things will be added to you.”</i></span></p>

Baptism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        1.   Baptism has been
associated here with the <u>up-front whole</u> rather than a <u>subsequent part</u>.
We have identified baptism with the general level because <b>(a)</b> we believe
scripture pictures baptism this way. Besides the several texts that speak
simply of baptism into Christ, every time scripture mentions consequences in
relation to baptism, it includes identification in the statement.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> In Acts <b>2</b>:38 baptism <i>on
the basis of the name of Jesus Christ</i> is unto remission of sins. In Acts<b>
22</b>:16 Paul should be baptized and wash away his sins, <i>calling on the
name of the Lord</i>. In 1 Peter<b> 3</b>:21 baptism saves insofar as it is an <i>appeal
to God </i>of/for a good conscience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              For practical purposes
associating baptism with the big picture <b>(b)</b> lessens the tendency to
causally connect it with consequences. Misconstruing the ordinance as a cause
fosters the feeling that baptism is a token, discrete ritual that effects
results.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> By focusing on the
act itself, we may see it with legal eyes and misread the way it relates to
consequences and other antecedents. Conceiving of an ordinance as a cause also
conceives of it as operating under law, and the participant psychologically
focuses on the process rather than on the person of God. He makes responses as
if he were fulfilling requirements that themselves procure the results. But one
person’s <u>responses even in the aggregate</u> cannot relate to reconciliation
in a causal way. How much more it is that none of his <u>specific responses</u>
can do so. Even more, a specific <u>formal</u> response cannot produce a
dynamic interpersonal consequence.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Associating baptism with
the big picture <b>(c)</b> gives wholeness and cohesiveness to the ordinance. Associating
baptism with a subsequent specific fragments what should be seen as one whole. Connecting
baptism with church membership, for example, separates church membership off as
a distinct item and institutionalizes baptism. <i>“Baptized into Christ”</i> is
not a metonymy for baptized into the church. The gift of the Spirit is not a
separate item so as, perhaps, to supernaturalize a part that belongs to the one
interpersonal baptism event. Sin as inherited guilt does not come into the
picture separately so as to legalize baptism. Theologically the concern for
wholeness leads us from separating the time of salvation from the time of
church membership, from untying the time of being saved and receiving the
Spirit, from contrasting visible and invisible or universal and local, from dividing
between inner and outer response, from making necessary distinction between
natural and supernatural, from speaking of water baptism <i>vs.</i> S/spirit
baptism.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              We do not say, then,
that baptism has a soteriological connection, a primarily soteriological
connection, or a soteriological rather than ecclesiological connection. We do
not say that baptism has an ecclesiological connection, a primarily
ecclesiological connection, or an ecclesiological rather than soteriological
connection. These approaches to the ordinance foster a rigid and fragmented
feel for Christianity itself. They create artificial distinctions within the
whole because they connect baptism with one thing that is coextensive and
contemporaneous with the others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              <b>(d)</b> There is no
perceived need to generate a non-biblical form to mark time-wise the initial
identification with Christ. That is what has happened in the practice of
kneeling and asking Jesus into your heart (“the sinner’s prayer”). That has
happened, we believe, because a perceived vacuum was created by moving baptism
from its up-front general place to one of the subsequent specifics and thereby
depriving it of its intended function. Baptism as appeal to God (1 Peter <b>3</b>:21)
embodies the meaning associated with the sinner’s prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        2.   Baptism is a commitment
to values and purposes before it has any kind of association with benefits and
consequences. We do not have Christ as savior without at the same time
acknowledging him as Lord.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        3.   The antecedent baptism is
separated from the consequent forgiveness, <i>etc</i>., by (a) <u>identity</u>
with Christ, (b) by God’s personal <u>choice</u>, and (c) by the <u>giftedness</u>
of the consequences. We do not speak of baptism as a condition for
reconciliation. Instead, we say <u>identity with Christ is the condition for
reconciliation</u>, which involves forgiveness, fellowship, and membership. As
a formal act that combines with the dynamic factors that it expresses, <u>baptism
communicates identification with Christ</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

interpersonal response rather than a legal transaction.<span style='position:

legal process, but commanding something formal does not necessarily mean
instituting something legal. Formal acts can communicate and define personal
relations as surely as they can effect results in legal operations. Christian
ordinances, however, are performative, dramatic, expressive, and communicative,
not authoritative and causal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Over the centuries, practices
and concepts have arisen that we deem foreign to the interpersonal character
and purpose of the new covenant, hence, foreign to the interpersonal nature and
purpose of its ordinances. These shifts have gone in two directions: the
ordinances have been reinterpreted as parts of (1) <u>legal</u> process and/or
(2) <u>natural</u> operation. In so treating them, interpreters have introduced
foreign elements. Beliefs and practices that stem from contextualizing the
ordinances in legal and natural frameworks are foreign and contradictory to New
Testament teaching. There is no basis for introducing such matters because the
new covenant provides an interpersonal context for its ordinances, because its
purpose is to establish interpersonal consequences, and because the originating
factors in each person’s observance are personal. A problem must be solved in
the realm of that problem. Since the problem exists in interpersonal matters
(alienation), actions involved in its solution must be interpersonal (reconciliation).
Interpersonal results do not come about by legal or natural means.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              The interpersonal
character of Christian ordinances, among other things, makes infant baptism
unnatural. <b>(a)</b> Infant baptism cannot originate from the interpersonal
factors prerequisite to an interpersonal ordinance. The meaning of a formal act
is nullified by the absence of appropriate behavioral factors. Infants have no <u>personal
faith</u>, and <u>proxy faith</u>, <u>subsequent faith</u>, or <u>non-content
faith</u> cannot establish a personal relationship. Infants cannot make
commitment to Christ, and proxies cannot make commitment for them. The faith of
another cannot stand for a person’s own faith except in legal transaction, but
Christian ordinances stand in a grace-faith covenant. A formal act in an
interpersonal context has no meaning except as a performative act; it means
something only if a person means something into it. Since infants cannot mean
anything into the ordinance, baptizing infants has no meaning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Besides the observation
that infants cannot do what baptism is, they have no need for what it involves.
<b>(b) </b>Infant baptism cannot be for the forgiveness of personal guilt
because none exists yet. An infant cannot yet operate responsibly in regard to
morality, and morality belongs only to interpersonal contexts.<b> </b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              (c) </span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Infant baptism cannot be for the forgiveness of
someone else’s sin—original sin—because guilt is personal. In personal
relations, guilt and penalty that come from personal action are no more
transferable than the action itself. Baptism cannot have any value for
forgiving “original guilt” because there is no way to transfer such guilt to
him except by legal assignment; but legal assignment is foreign to
interpersonal need, process, and consequences. Racial guilt is denied here in
any sense that deals with divine fellowship and eternal destiny.        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              <b>(d)</b> Baptism is
not an outward sign of an external covenant because the new covenant is not an
external covenant, it does not have an external component, and its “sign” is
not simply an external act. It is a covenant in which everyone under it must
know the Lord to get into it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

(proxy baptism)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Persons establish interpersonal
relationships. Proxy baptism is legal. By the nature of interpersonalism, one
person’s faith or obedience cannot substitute for another’s. Legitimizing such
a substitute requires moving outside the interpersonal realm of the problem in
order to invoke a legal solution to it. Since baptism does not relate to legal
operations, a proxy functionary cannot fulfill it. The seven sons of Sceva
found out that Christianity does not accomplish its purposes by the magical
invocation of the name of Christ or by going through certain rituals. Baptism
for the dead breaches the principle of personal involvement in interpersonal
operations as well as the lack of inherent necessity for formal acts in
interpersonal operations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        3.   Official administration</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              As to meaning, baptism
is done by the “candidate,” not by an administrator. Baptismal validity is not <i>ex
opere operato</i>. What makes an observance valid depends on the kind of
observance it is. Personal observance gets its validity from personal factors,
but official administration belongs to legal transaction. Making the validity
of baptism dependent on duly ordained clergy makes its validity like that of a
wedding ceremony, which requires a duly authorized officer of the law as well
as official witnesses. Baptism does not have to be performed “publicly” by a
special person. Grace does not flow through the church by way of official
operatives, but directly from God to the believer. Grace does not follow an
institutional “flow chart”; it flows interpersonally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Should <u>God</u> decide
to establish authorized administration, he would do so for practical rather
than theological reasons. His people would have to know that from positive
commandment because they could not know it by inference from first principles. We
know of no explicit or implicit teaching to that end in the New Testament. Anything
of a practical sort that the <u>church</u> comes up with must not pre-empt the
interpersonal reality in which Christian ordinances stand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Since the validity of
baptism does not depend on who assists in its observance, we see no reason for
refusing baptism performed by members of other Christian heritages or for
considering it “alien baptism.” If it is baptism, there is no reason or right
to redo it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              The validity of baptism
does not depend on any particular wording pronounced in connection with its
observance. The candidate’s basic understanding of its meaning establishes its
validity. The problem over “correct” formula centers on the “trinity” issue. Among
Christian churches, churches of Christ, disciples of Christ there has been some
latitude in views of the trinity and therefore on the manner in which that
understanding might affect the form and formula for baptism. At any rate, the
so-called “trinitarian” expression in Matthew <b>28</b> does not conflict with
the “Jesus-only” statements in Acts. Since baptism is not a legal transaction,
there is no notion here of the “valid wording of the contract.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        5.   Delayed baptism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In some quarters of the <u>ancient
church</u>, baptism came to be delayed as long as possible because Christians
did not know what to do with post-baptismal sins. That practice—along with
extreme unction—evidenced the tendency to view salvation as dealing with
previous sins rather than with sin as such, that is, with sins rather than
relationship. It was a quantifying approach to a relational issue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In some quarters of the <u>modern
church</u>, baptism is sometimes delayed until a new believer gets settled in a
congregation to whom he can witness his faith through baptism and where he can
serve and grow in the faith. This practice associates baptism with a particular
consequence rather than with the initial commitment; it does so as something
that identifies a person with the visible church (or a part of it) rather than
with Christ. It treats the consequences as a series spread out over time rather
than as aspects of one whole event. The logical series—forgiveness, gift of the
Spirit, and membership in the body—gets correlated with chronological sequence
so that what were intentionally simultaneous and coextensive are handled as if
they were sequential and parstials. Identification with Christ is the
overwhelming emphasis in the New Testament, a stress that is more inclusive
than church membership. In fact, only 1 Corinthians<b> 12</b>:13 speaks of “baptism”
into the church, and there the apostle stresses the Spirit aspect of baptism
since he says, <i>“In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>13</span> If baptism is interpersonal with
Christ, it relates to something that logically precedes entering a group or
institution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In ancient times, the
practice of heremobaptism (“daily baptism”) considered baptism a ceremonial
ablution that symbolized cleansing of sins committed since the last cleansing. In
modern times, people request rebaptism periodically because they have sinned or
sense a lull in their devotion to Christ. They turn to baptism as a way of
relieving perhaps a hypersensitive conscience. As a result, baptism replaces
ongoing repentance and prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

into finished business</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              On the opposite extreme
of hemerobaptism stands any impulse to regard baptism as related to finished
business. Interpersonal relationships cannot be finalized. Entering Christ is
not like receiving a high school diploma, which gives permanent status and
privileges even though the recipients may forget most of what they learned to
get it. Interpersonal observances are not time-referenced. Law may validate for
a time like a driver’s license or permanently like a college degree. But
personal relationships are processual, not categorical. When people establish
relationship, they give no thought to how long. Friendships do not last so long
or only so long. Initiation into friendship with God ushers in commitment to a
holy life of growth; it does not mean obtaining certain desirable consequences
and having them “for good.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Baptism does not
regenerate inherited natural depravity. We know of no biblical evidence for
such a meaning of the ordinance, and we see no positive basis for the doctrine
of natural depravity itself—at least in any sense or degree that precludes
personal response to the gospel.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>14</span> There
is nothing involved here like an “infused grace.” Such an idea moves salvation
into ontology and attempts to invoke miracle to solve alienation. It does so
despite the lack of any teaching that Adam’s spiritual capacity after he sinned
differed from what it was before in a biologically inheritable sense. Baptism
does not enable people to have faith by miracle; it expresses the mustard-seed
faith they already have through personal influence. We do, of course,
acknowledge the psychological depravity that arises from factors personally
produced rather than genetically transmitted. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                   9.  Inherent necessity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              <b>(a)</b> Considering
baptism inherently necessary would misunderstand the nature and purpose of a formal
act. Interpersonal processes do not require any formal act. So establishing
identification with God requires no ordinance at all. If one is instituted, it
is for the person’s benefit, not God’s or the system’s operation. An ordinance
serves to focalize meaning, concretize significance, clarify the invisible,
make the abstract tangible. Christians perform ordinances because they are
appropriate, not because they are legally, rationally, or naturally necessary. We
are not to take a <i>sine qua non</i> attitude toward ordinances. Ordinances
are “necessary” because that God has instituted them, not because he had to
institute them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              <b>(b)</b> Considering
baptism inherently necessary would also misunderstand the nature and purpose of
God himself. God is a person and therefore operates like one; he does not
operate with the rigidness characteristic of law, nature, or thought. He takes
into consideration intent of action, attitude of persons, and purpose of
operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              These two observations
about necessity enable Christians to generalize salvation principles to
practical situations not specifically dealt with in the New Testament. Circumstances
sometimes do not make baptism possible—or do not make it possible without risk
to life or health. A repentant believer committed to Jesus Christ might die
without baptism through some misunderstanding or insuperable circumstance. It
may not be clear whether a young person with a terminal condition has yet
attained the age of accountability. Persons committed to Christ may honestly
misunderstand that baptism should have been their own response or should have
been an act of immersion. For purposes of fellowship and Christian unity, we
must deal with situations like these. We should not interpret them like cases
where someone has not filled out properly all the right documents for a
passport. We must deal with them by inferences from the nature of the new
covenant and the redemptive purpose of the holy, loving God who instituted
ordinances and knows the hearts of “those who diligently seek him.” All the
while, each believer strives both to teach and learn the Lord’s will more
perfectly on this and other issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In matters of personal
relationship, formal matters can be overlooked entirely for legitimate
practical reasons. The situation with baptism is analogous to Paul’s treatment
of circumcision in Romans <b>2</b>:25-29. Both circumcision and baptism are
formal acts related to spiritual relationships. Circumcision had two aspects to
it, one national and the other spiritual. Baptism does not have a national
aspect to it, but it does parallel circumcision in its spiritual associations—as
in identifying an adult proselyte with Israel and therefore with the values and
purposes expressed in God’s constitution for that nation. Speaking of
circumcision in its spiritual dimension, Paul observes, <i>“If then the
uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be
counted for circumcision?”</i> (Romans<b> 2</b>:26). Paul may have in mind
godfearers, or <i>sebomenoi</i>, like Cornelius (Acts<b> 10</b>:2, 22, 35;<b>
13</b>:16, 26; note <b>15</b>:7-9). These people worshipped the one true God
but had not been circumcised to become proselytes and full-fledged Jews. In
light of <b>2</b>:6-16, Paul may also have in mind more distant people who had
only conscience to guide them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In speaking about the <u>spiritual</u>
aspect of circumcision, Paul says that not conforming to the values and
purposes in God’s revelation changes a Jew’s circumcision to uncircumcision.
Conversely, conforming to them changes a Gentile’s uncircumcision into
circumcision. Paul does not explain why this is so, but we infer that it is so
by the nature of the case: personal relationships do not depend on formal
observances. Matters of the heart—sincerity, motivation, attitude—override the
lack of formal observance under appropriate conditions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Paul is quite bold here.
He does not treat this circumstance in a <u>neutral</u> way by saying that God
will deal with uncircumcised persons in a just manner. That would leave the
matter open-ended, and readers could still infer that uncircumcised people were
lost because of their uncircumcision. Instead, Paul treats the “pious
uncircumcised” in a <u>positive</u> way, affirming that because they keep God’s
ordinances, God reckons their uncircumcision as circumcision. His comment is
reminiscent of a later one about Abraham, who in his uncircumcision had
faith/trust reckoned for righteousness (Romans <b>4</b>:3, 9-12). The
righteousness Abraham had come from interpersonal considerations (faith/trust,
promise) rather than <u>legal</u> ones. So the consequent blessings of the
patriarch and his role among men grew from interpersonal considerations: <i>“Not
through <u>law</u> was the promise to Abraham or his seed”</i> (<b>4</b>:13). Legal
and interpersonal are different kinds of systems (Romans<b> 4</b>:14-16;
Galatians<b> 3</b>:10-12). Formal considerations like circumcision the apostle
affirms can even be waived under appropriate circumstances in spiritual
matters, or as we are saying, in interpersonal systems. If an action can even
be set aside under legitimate circumstances, it has a different meaning and
type of necessity than an act done in a legal system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Of course, it is “necessary”
to do what God tells us, and so baptism can be said to be necessary in that “interpersonal”
sense. That is simply part of acknowledging the lordship of Christ in
conversion. But most cases we have to deal with come up because of honest <u>mis</u>obedience
rather than intentional <u>dis</u>obedience.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              No correlation should be
drawn between <u>baptism and outward action</u>. For one thing, valid outward
response arises from internal factors they express. Furthermore, no clear line exists
between overt behavior and inner commitment. Finally, visible obedience
reciprocates with invisible motivation. Separating inner and outer seems as
artificial in the theology of baptism as it does anywhere else in Christianity.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>15</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              There are no short cuts
to personal relationships and no artificial substitutes for what it takes to
have the real thing. Even as a relational process involves actions on both
sides of the relationship, so also it involves both inner and outer actions on
both sides of it. No correlation should be drawn, then, between <u>baptism as
outer action and visible church membership</u>. Baptism as outer action not
only makes an unnatural distinction between inner and outer, it makes an
unnatural distinction between salvation and the church—between the invisible
church of the saved and the visible church as a religious community. Baptism,
outer action, and visible church membership do not constitute a set. Instead,
baptism personally identifies people with Christ up front at the level of the
whole, not with any particular consequent within it. Those particulars come
from God only in consequence of identification with the whole, that is, with
Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Not dividing between
inner and outer response can correspond also with not dividing between <u>water
baptism and S/spirit baptism</u>, depending on how the latter expression is
understood. If “baptism in the Spirit” is taken as alternative terminology for “gift
of the Spirit,” it refers to what we have called the second consequence of
identification with Jesus Christ. S/spirit baptism would then be simultaneous
with commitment to Christ in so-called “water baptism.” The aspects of a whole
may be distinguishable mentally, but they are not separate in the reality
itself. In another direction, since outer does not correlate with works, legal
operation, and baptism, inner does not correlate with faith, ontic operation
(miraculous regeneration by the Spirit), and Spirit baptism. Scripture never
uses the expression “water baptism.”<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>16</span> In
fact, one way of reading 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:13 joins (water) baptism and
the Spirit into one statement: <i>“In one Spirit we were all [water?] baptized
into one body.” </i>We prefer, then, to consider inner and outer responses and their
consequences as facets of the same whole event. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Baptism does not deal with
legal and natural processes, so it is not legitimized by principles derived
from those categories. Authority and miracle do not remove alienation. Alienation
and reconciliation have to do with persons and therefore with behavior that
makes or breaks fellowship between persons. Alienation and reconciliation do
not deal with legal and ontological means or ends, but with interpersonal ones.
Interpersonal consequences come from interpersonal antecedents. </span></p>

the intended distinction here between cause and condition, see Virgil Warren’s <i>What
the Bible Says About Salvation</i> (Joplin, Missouri: College Press, l982), pp.
194-216. In general, a condition involves a <u>dependent first person</u> who
can do nothing decisive about his need, a <u>sovereign second person</u> who is
under no compulsion to meet that need, a <u>free promise</u> to help, an <u>obedience
commanded</u> to the person in need, and a <u>result bestowed</u> by the other
person. A condition precedes the result but does not cause it directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part. Under conditionality, antecedent acts are
performed, but consequent results are given. <u>Conditionality</u> is an
interpersonal construct; it involves one person’s active trust in another
person’s free promise to give. Under <u>works</u>, there is no second person,
no promise, and no bestowed results. In that case the result is the
righteousness prerequisite to being viewed as righteous so there can be
fellowship with the Righteous One. The result would come directly and only from
a person’s own continuous obedience to all elements of the standard for
righteousness (Galatians <b>3</b>:10-12). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span>Mark
<b>16</b>:16 presents a technical exception if accorded textual integrity. Even
there, of course, identification with Christ comes into the picture. Belief and
baptism are responses to the gospel, which is the good news of salvation
through Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span>Even
if baptism were connected with a consequent specific like forgiveness, it would
not be a “work” in the Pauline sense. It would be a condition whereas works are
<u>causes</u>. As suggested by Habakkuk <b>2</b>:4 and Genesis <b>15</b>:6, “faith”
is Paul’s code word for the interpersonal situation; “works” is his code word
for the legal situation (Romans <b>3</b>:28). Inner and outer actions occur in
both situations, but “works” are actions done in the context of law; hence,
they have <u>causal</u> significance under law because continuously doing
everything commanded in the Law produces the person’s own perfect righteousness.
In faith, however, we only “have faith” that our active <u>concern</u> for
righteousness will be viewed graciously by the other Person and reckoned for
what it seeks to be rather than is.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span>There
is nothing in baptism that implies automatic results. A person may say that
there is more to baptism than identification with Christ, and in a sense that
is so; but anything “more” is <u>within</u> this definition, not <u>besides</u>
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11</span>Modern
views of baptism have been historically conditioned. In the degenerate medieval
church, salvation had come to be viewed and practiced in legal, institutional
terms and baptism along with it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        By way of reaction, salvation—at
least in some ways—began to be moved out of legal procedure; but since baptism
had meantime been construed as a legal act, the reformers retained that feel
for it. So, it was associated with the only thing in Christianity that could
have the appearance of legality—church membership. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Church membership, however, is
a subsequent specific; and so others have reacted again by associating baptism
with a more important specific: forgiveness of sins. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        This whole scenario has erred
in two ways: (1) by making baptism a legal act and (2) by associating baptism
with a specific consequence. The method of solution erred by being reactive
rather than positive: it reacted to the contemporary situation (reformation)
rather than making a positive start from New Testament teaching about first
principles (restoration).</span></p>

historical group of fellowships that designate themselves the “restoration movement”
are rather unique among evangelicals in not having a doctrine of <u>natural
depravity</u>. They have not seen in the historic fall any biblical indication
that man incurred a loss of ability in spiritual matters over what Adam had
before he sinned. In its place there has been put what can be called <u>psychological
depravity</u>, which comes from one’s own ingrained experience rather than
through genetic heredity. What has come about by experience can be overcome by
personal influence in contrast to supernatural miracle. The universal
sinfulness of people and their inability to save themselves has been explained
on other grounds than as results of depravity in ontic capacity. See <i>What
the Bible Says About Salvation</i>, pp. 18-43 for one discussion of universal
sinfulness and the impossibility of self-salvation.</span></p>

Paul, works and faith do not correspond with inner and outer so as to make
baptism a work. Works differs from faith by the settings in which they occur
(law and interpersonalism respectively) and by the kind of connections they
have with consequences (cause and conditionality respectively). The point is
not what act people do, but why they do it; the issue is what meaning and
purpose the act has, and how it relates to consequences. Such things are
determined by the kind of system in which the actions stand.</span></p>

Christian baptism is not simply John’s baptism overlaid with the gift of the
Spirit. The twelve disciples of John in Acts <b>19</b>:1-7 were baptized in the
name of Jesus, which shows that the meaning of the two baptisms were parallel,
not hierarchical. They had parallel meanings because they identified with
separate matters. At most, John’s baptism was a repentance baptism with
consequent forgiveness of sins. Christ’s baptism, however, involves consequent
forgiveness <u>and</u> relationship with the Spirit through identity with
