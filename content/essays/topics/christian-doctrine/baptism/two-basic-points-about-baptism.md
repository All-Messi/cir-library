style='font-size:12.0pt'>Two points should be highlighted in presentations
about baptism. First, baptism should not be too closely identified with outer
response. That lends itself to distinguishing inner and outer, identifying
faith with inner and baptism with outer, and then affirming that it is the
inner dimension that justifies rather than the outer expressive act as well,
thus trying to avoid baptism as a work and bringing it into conformity with the
Pauline formula “salvation by faith” <i>vs.</i> works. But “faith” in
Romans/Galatians does not mean inner action; that is the usage in James. Paul
means action in the context of personal relationship (faith) <i>vs</i>. action
in the context of legal process (works). We do well to unite inner and outer
response in salvation and to consider baptism itself as comprised of both
dimensions inseparably. That unity of aspects applies to all acts of obedience.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Second, baptism should not be identified
too closely with forgiveness of sins. We do better to understand baptism as a
personal act of identification with (God by identification with) Christ (who is
one with God). This puts it <u>up front</u> at the level of the <u>whole</u>
rather than with a significant subsequent part—forgiveness of sins, which then
leads to the gift of the Spirit and church membership. Baptism can then rightly
be considered a part of the salvation process by being a part of God's only
condition for salvation—identity with Christ; and it can have that value
without having any partial or indirect causal connection with any consequence
of being “in Christ.” We are baptized “into Christ” to indicate formally our
willingness to identify with him and commit to him; and on the basis of that
identity God forgives, <i>etc</i>. Were there no forgiveness even involved,
baptism would still state that identification (cp. Jesus' baptism, the baptism
of saved Jews, the Christian baptism of John's previous disciples, and the “baptism”
to Moses, Paul’s fear of Corinthians being baptized into Paul). Baptism would express
a sense of oneness with Christ, personal commitment to him, to his values, to
his purposes, to his lordship, to the degree he himself exemplified obedience
to God the Father. That is a much richer meaning for the ordinance. On the <u>basis
of our acting (<i>vs.</i> active) subjective identity with Christ</u> (not a
particular, formal act of identification itself) <u>God alone acts objectively</u>
to forgive, <i>etc.</i> Salvation by faith <i>vs</i>. works is meant in an
interpersonal <i>vs.</i> legal sense. Actions, whether inner or outer, done in
the context of relationship can have no other than a conditional (<i>vs.</i>
causal) value; so the only acts that have anything to do with results are the
acts the other person freely promised before we acted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Both of these points appeal to holistic
thought. The whole person comes into the picture, not just hthe inner or outer
aspect. The whole of life comes into the picture, not just sins or
reconciliation or church membership or other subsequent divine blessings.
Consequently, salvation as a whole and baptism as a particular fit with one
prime characteristic of interpersonalism, that is, holism.</span></p>
