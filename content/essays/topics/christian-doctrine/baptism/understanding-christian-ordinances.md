<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Introduction</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The following presentation is, strictly
speaking, the author’s understanding of Christian ordinances even though it
attempts to represent fairly the view taken by a larger movement as well. There
is some diversity in that movement, which is natural enough in a free-church
heritage the size of ours; but that diversity makes it more difficult to state
“our position.” Nevertheless, unity through restoration accomplishes one thing
for us and for everyone here today: it assures the desire to continue adjusting
toward a more biblical understanding. Hopefully, this treatment will synthesize
our ideas and thereby sharpen and improve what we all believe and practice about
Christian ordinances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We attempt here not only to describe, but
to provide biblical rationale and to contrast our own viewpoint with apparently
foreign concepts and incompatible alternatives. Such a task is a formidable one
because so many doctrinal issues surface in connection with the ordinances; so
many tacit assumptions become visible in the practice of baptism especially. By
concentrating on framework of thought, structure of presentation, and basis for
presuppositions, we hope to achieve wholeness, cohesiveness, clarity, and
economy of expression. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Because of time constraints, our
discussion will be somewhat uneven. After illustrating the basis for “interpersonalism”
as the underlying reality in Christian truth, we first draw out implications
for Christian baptism. The Lord’s Supper ends up being treated more briefly
because it is less complex and because the listener can generalize to it the
implications already applied to baptism.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>I. The Interpersonal Nature of the Ordinances<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A.  The Interpersonal <u>Nature</u>
of the Covenant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The <u>nature</u> of the new
covenant sets the nature of its ordinances. When Jeremiah prophesied the coming
of a covenant, he not only indicated that there would be <u>another</u>
covenant, but that it would be another <u>kind</u> of covenant. It would not be
like the one Yahveh made with Israel at Sinai after the exodus (<b>31</b>:31-34).
Yahveh said his people would “know” him. “Knowing” Yahveh means more than
knowing about him or believing he exists because knowing about God does not
especially bring in the sin problem and its solution. Sin is something that
happens between persons relative to their values and purposes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        We can call the new covenant “interpersonal”
because it addresses active relationship between persons in contrast to legal
function, natural process, rational process. The New Testament discussion of
the covenant that came treats it in terms that belong to personal relationship,
particularly in contrast to legal systems. Paul’s familiar comments in Romans <b>3-4</b>,
Galatians <b>3</b>, and elsewhere highlight the contrast between faith, grace,
promise, reckoning, reconciliation, life, love, spirit, and the like on one
hand, and works, law, debt, flesh, and the like on the other. Every act that
takes place in a fundamental category participates in the nature of that
category. Christian ordinances belong to a grace-faith covenant; so they are
interpersonal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  B.  The Interpersonal <u>Purpose</u>
of the Covenant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The <u>purpose</u> of the
covenant also sets the nature of its ordinances. Interpersonal consequences
come from interpersonal antecedents. The result of the new economy would be
fellowship: Yahveh would be their God, and they would be his people. Their sins
would no longer stand between them and him, because he would no longer <i>“remember
their sins”</i> against them (Jeremiah <b>31</b>:34; cp. Hebrews <b>8</b>:6-<b>10</b>:18).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> In the place where it was said
they were not his people, they would be called sons of the living God (Hosea <b>1</b>:10-11).
They would have personal relationship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        After speaking of the new
covenant in 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>, Paul moves ahead in<b> 5</b>:17-21 to
describe God’s purpose in that covenant and in calling men to be his
ambassadors. The apostle calls his work a <i>“ministry of reconciliation”</i>
in which people are entreated to be reconciled to God through Christ. “Reconciliation”
implies “alienation,” and both terms address interpersonal matters. Estrangement
ceases if the trespasses that caused it are removed. Sins are removed by no
longer reckoning them against sinners because they are in Christ, the Sinless
One. The reconciling purpose of the new covenant establishes interpersonal
meaning for its ordinances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  C.  The Interpersonal <u>Source</u>
of the Ordinances </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Finally, the <u>source</u> of
the ordinances sets the nature of the ordinances. Jeremiah indicated that Yahveh
would <i>“write the new covenant on their heart”</i>; his people would
internalize the values and purposes of that covenant. He would write his law in
their inward parts rather than on <i>“tables of stone,”</i> as Paul later put
it (2 Corinthians<b> 3</b>:7). Instead of an impersonal law that could be
expressed on stone, a personal revelation and abiding influence were to come
that persons would internalize <i>“in their hearts.” </i>As a result,
psychologically speaking, any obediences in that kind of covenant spring from
internal motivation instead of external compulsion. The origin of an act
determines the nature of the act because behavior has the character of what
motivates it. Antecedent must be amenable to consequence. Acts are <i>“after
their kind”</i> in keeping with the law of harvest: people reap what they sow
(Galatians <b>6</b>:7-9; cp. <b>5</b>:13-25). What is born of flesh is flesh;
what is born of spirit is spirit (John <b>3</b>:6; cp. 1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:50?).
Likewise, what comes from faith is faith. Since baptism and the Lord’s Supper arise
from faith, they are faith—they are interpersonal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A.  Baptism as Personal
Identification with Christ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The Great Commission sets the
approach to understanding baptism by establishing its meaning at a broad level.
Baptism identifies a person with Father-Son-Spirit (Matthew <b>28</b>:19). According
to several passages in Acts and the epistles, baptism identifies a person with
the Lord Jesus (Acts <b>8</b>:16; <b>10</b>:48; <b>19</b>:5; Romans <b>6</b>:3;
Galatians <b>3</b>:27). These statements parallel other expressions about identification
with Moses (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:2), with Paul (1 Corinthians<b> 1</b>:13-14),
and with John’s baptism. The twelve in Ephesus who had been baptized into John’s
baptism were then baptized into Christ (Acts <b>19</b>:2-5), which implies that
the two baptisms have parallel significances, that is, parallel
identifications. When people are in Christ, they are <i>“new creations”</i> (2
Corinthians <b>5</b>:17); they have a new identity along with everything that
entails. Baptism is a <b>rite of passage</b> into Christ; it is an <b>initiatory
rite</b> into a personal relationship with him; it is an <b>oath of induction</b>
into a new identity. <i>“In Christ” </i>is not so much a status or position as
it is an identity—<u>who</u> a person is. And so we pass to what that new
identity encompasses.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  B.  The Meaning of Personal
Identification with Christ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        1.   Commitment to Christ  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Identification with
Christ implies meanings associated with that identification. Within the meaning
of baptism lie certain implied commitments. In baptism a person commits himself
to the <u>values</u> and <u>purposes</u> of Christ, values and purposes that
transcend the material frame of reference. They are spiritual rather than
fleshly, interpersonal rather than impersonal, centered above the individual
rather than in him. They stress invisible realities that are eternal, rather
than visible ones that are temporary.                                                  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Living above the
material lifestyle is set forth in two images associated with baptism. First,
Paul pictures the transcendent orientation as a <u>resurrected lifestyle</u>
(Romans <b>6</b>) and <u>ascended lifestyle</u> (Colossians <b>2</b>:12 + <b>3</b>:1-17).
The death, burial, resurrection, ascension of Jesus constituted the most
distinctive event in his life because he alone resurrected to heaven never to
die again. Baptism appropriately identifies us with Jesus by picturing that
unique event. But baptism does more than dramatically re-enact what <u>Jesus</u>
did. It makes a statement about what <u>we</u> are going to do and what <u>we</u>
aspire to become. It is a performative act. Psychologically in baptism we
crucify our fleshly orientation and bury it, and we adopt a higher orientation—a
resurrected one, an ascended one that is “above all that.” Paul says we are <i>“united
with”</i> Christ<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> in this
likeness of his death and resurrection. By “uniting” with him in baptism, we
formally “identify” with him there, and our identity with him means we are <i>“new
creatures.”</i> Since baptism is immersion as to form, it bears a formal “likeness”
to his death and resurrection.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> To
sum up in one statement, baptism is a <u>formal likeness</u> of a <u>historical
analogy</u> to a <u>lifestyle transformation</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Adopting the
transcendent lifestyle means starting over from that changed perspective. During
his discussion with Nicodemus (John<b> 3</b>), Jesus pictures in a second way
this starting over from above. He calls it rebirth, birth from above, birth
from spirit rather than from flesh. He calls for a <u>reborn lifestyle</u> (<b>3</b>:19-21;
cp. Titus <b>3</b>:5), one that is concerned with faith (<b>3</b>:16ff) and
spirit, not biological descent, national identity, or even physical life (John <b>3</b>:13-15).
Since baptism takes place in water, people are psychologically “<u>born</u> of
water” when they commit to a new way of life in the higher kingdom (3:5), which
is not of this world (<b>18</b>:36). <i>“Being born of water”</i> expresses a
new identification with the spiritual values and transcendent purposes (cp. 2
Corinthians <b>5</b>:16-17) of the Savior who is <i>“lifted up”</i> (<b>3</b>:14),
as it were, and draws to himself all nationalities of this world (John <b>3</b>:16-17;
<b>12</b>:32).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              As we are using the term
here, <u>identification</u> means more than an appreciation for Christ or a
sense of association with him. Identification involves <u>commitment</u> to him
and his values and <u>participation</u> in his purposes and work. Baptism is a <b>pledge
of allegiance </b>to Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        2.   Consequences of
commitment to Christ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In relation to the new
interpersonal covenant, baptism arises from personal responses like trust and
repentance, expresses identification with Jesus Christ, and by extension commitment
to his values and purposes. Because of that (1) <u>identity</u> and its implied
commitments, God (2) <u>chooses</u> to (3) <u>give</u> certain consequences
people need. He chooses to fulfill his covenant promise to forgive sin, to give
fellowship with his Spirit, and to add people to Christ’s body, the church. Two
things stand between antecedent responses and consequent blessings: <u>identity</u>
with Christ and God’s <u>choice</u> to fulfill previous covenant promises. Furthermore,
the manner in which these consequences come to the person is by <u>gift</u>
from the other Person. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Inside of what it means
to be identified with Christ and committed to him lie the benefits of that new
identity. Since baptism formally expresses the identification from which these
benefits come, scripture often speaks of those benefits in connection with
baptism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              a.   forgiveness of sins</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    Salvation is
primarily reconciliation back into fellowship with God (2 Corinthians<b> 5</b>:17-21).
Lostness represents alienation from God in consequence of personal sin. Salvation
means solving the sin problem. In the new covenant, God no longer remembers
people’s sins against them. Salvation deals with sin more than sins because it
deals with people’s overall <i>character</i> more than their individual acts
and with their estranged <i>state</i>, which by metonymy is called sin. People <u>come
to be considered</u> righteous more than <u>come to be</u> righteous; they come
to be <u>considered righteous</u> through identity with Christ who <u>is
righteous</u>. Personal responses that identify a person with Christ, scripture
associates with the consequent salvation itself. Since baptism stands among
these responses, scripture connects it with forgiveness and salvation even
though it is a formal act: <i>“He that believes and is baptized will be saved”</i>
(Mark <b>16</b>:16); <i>“Arise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling
on his name” </i>(Acts <b>22</b>:16); <i>“. . . which after a true likeness now
saves you—baptism”</i> (1 Peter <b>3</b>:31). Similarly, John’s baptism is
directly associated with forgiveness in Mark <b>1</b>:4 and Luke <b>3</b>:3.<b>
</b>In keeping with the fact that it relates to forgiveness of sin, baptism is
like a cleansing (Ephesians <b>5</b>:26; Titus<b> 3</b>:5), and its element is
water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>gift of the Spirit</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    On Pentecost Peter
included <i>“the gift of the Spirit” </i>among God’s gifts to those he
commanded to identify with Christ through repentance and baptism. We understand
the gift of the Spirit in this case to be the gift that the Spirit is rather
than a gift that the Spirit gives. Commonly called <i>“the indwelling gift of
the Spirit,”</i> this gift consists primarily of interpersonal relationship
with God in the person of the Spirit, because renewed relationship can
accompany the forgiveness of what brought alienation. No decision must be made
at this general level between natural and supernatural involvements. The
natural-supernatural variable relates to particulars of each conversion and its
setting. In all probability the expression <i>“gift of the Spirit”</i> equals
the other expressions <i>“baptism in the Spirit”</i> and <i>“earnest of the
Spirit.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              c.   membership in the
body of Christ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    The Acts <b>2</b>
conversion accounts include God’s adding together the increasing number of
those being saved (<b>2</b>:41, 47). There is one baptism for both Jews and
Gentiles who identify with the one Lord to create the one body—the <i>“new
united mankind”</i> (Ephesians <b>4</b>:4-6; <b>2</b>:11-18). Those whom God
adds to Christ’s body are the same ones he forgives and gives his Spirit for. Consequently,
no intended distinction exists between the “invisible” and visible church—or,
for that matter, between the universal church and the local churches taken
collectively. No distinction exists then in the time or condition for entering
the one or the other. A person enters the salvation of Christ and the body of
Christ at the same time and on the same condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              All the individual
responses people make combine to form one complex condition. No individual
response within the general condition<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6
</span>is anything more than conditionally appropriate to the consequences God
provides. Baptism has no more, no less, and no other than this same kind of
function. Repentant faith expressed in baptism identifies with Christ; identity
with Christ is the condition for all consequences God gives. So to speak, <i>“Identify
with Christ and all these things will be added to you.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  C.  Observations on This
Understanding of Baptism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        1.   Baptism is an
interpersonal response rather than a legal transaction.<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>11 </span>Baptism is a performative act. The prime
motivation for doing it is to <u>say</u> something, not to <u>get</u>
something. It is easy, perhaps, to associate a formal act with a legal process,
but commanding something formal does not necessarily mean instituting something
legal. Formal acts can communicate and define in personal relations as surely
as they can effect results in legal operations. Christian ordinances, however,
are performative, dramatic, expressive, communicative, not authoritative and
causal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        2.   This format for
understanding baptism stresses the big picture. Interpersonal relationship is
dynamic, reciprocal, qualitative, and involves growth by degrees. When the
aspects of an operation are interdependent in this way, the operation must be
holistic and harmonious. For this reason, we have emphasized the interpersonal
nature of the covenant as such. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Furthermore, the
antecedents and the consequences correlate with the persons involved on both
sides of the interpersonal relationship that is being re-established in
reconciliation. Antecedents and consequences therefore form two natural
groupings rather than separable responses and unrelated gifts. Repentance,
faith, and baptism are not three things but one whole response: repentant faith
expressed in baptism. The total response identifies with Jesus Christ. Identity
with Christ is the basic condition for the natural set of gifts that together
really comprise various aspects of one consequence: restored relationship. Forgiveness
of sins is one aspect involved here, because sins are what alienates persons. The
gift of the Spirit is another aspect involved here, because that represents
restored relationship with God in the person of the Spirit. Fellowship with all
others that have been likewise reconciled to God is a third aspect naturally
contemporaneous with the other two. There is one issue—interpersonal
relationship, one condition—personal identity with Christ, and one consequence—reconciliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              We have identified
baptism with the general level because <b>(a) </b>we believe scripture pictures
baptism this way. Besides the several texts that speak simply of baptism into
Christ, every time scripture mentions consequences in relation to baptism, it
includes identification in the statement.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>7</span> In Acts <b>2</b>:38 baptism <i>on the basis of the name of
Jesus Christ</i> is unto remission of sins. In Acts <b>22</b>:16 Paul should be
baptized and wash away his sins, <i>calling on the name of the Lord</i>. In 1
Peter<b> 3</b>:21 baptism saves insofar as it is an <i>appeal to God </i>of/for
a good conscience. Identifying baptism with the general level makes sense of
mentioning it in the Great Commission itself, which describes the apostolic
enterprise. It also makes sense of using it as a “handle,” or shorthand
expression, for converting someone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              For practical purposes,
associating baptism with the big picture<b> (b) </b>lessens the tendency to
causally connect it with consequences. Misconstruing the ordinance as a cause
fosters the feeling that baptism is a token, discrete ritual that effects
results.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> By focusing on the
act itself, we may see it with legal eyes and misread the way it relates to
consequences and other antecedents. Conceiving of an ordinance as a cause also
conceives of it as operating under law, and participants psychologically
focuses on the process rather than on the person of God. They make responses as
if they were fulfilling requirements that themselves procure results. But people’s
<u>responses, even in the aggregate,</u> cannot relate to reconciliation in a
causal way. How much more it is that none of their <u>specific responses</u>
can do so. Even more, a specific <u>formal</u> response cannot produce a
dynamic interpersonal consequence.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Associating baptism with
the big picture <b>(c) </b>gives wholeness and cohesiveness to the
understanding of the ordinance. Associating baptism with a subsequent specific,
fragments what should be seen as one whole. Connecting baptism with church
membership, for example, separates church membership off as a distinct item and
institutionalizes baptism<i>. “Baptized into Christ”</i> is not a metonymy for
baptized into the church. The gift of the Spirit is not to be separated off as
a separate item so as, perhaps, to supernaturalize a part of what belongs to
the one interpersonal baptism event. Sin as inherited guilt is not brought in
and focused on separately so as to legalize baptism. Theologically the concern
for wholeness leads us from separating the time of salvation from the time of
church membership, from untying the time of being saved and receiving the
Spirit, from contrasting visible and invisible or universal and local, from
dividing between inner and outer response, from making necessary distinction
between natural and supernatural, from speaking of water baptism vs. S/spirit
baptism.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span></span></p>

commitment to values and purposes. We do not say that baptism has an
ecclesiological meaning, a primarily ecclesiological meaning, or an
ecclesiological rather than soteriological meaning. That would omit both the
commitment to values and the other consequences God gives. We do not say that
baptism pictures what has already happened. That would omit baptism as a
performative statement to God as well insofar as that would remove its role in
expressing identification with Christ. These other approaches to this Christian
ordinance foster a rigid and fragmented feel for Christianity itself. They
create artificial distinctions within the whole because they connect baptism
with one thing that is coextensive and contemporaneous with the others.</span></p>

associated here with the <u>upfront</u> whole rather than a <u>subsequent</u> part.
There is no perceived need to generate a non-biblical form to mark timewise the
initial identification with Christ. From the perspective of this presentation,
that is what has happened with the practice of kneeling and asking Jesus into
your heart (“the sinner’s prayer”). That has happened, we believe, because a
perceived vacuum was created by moving baptism from its up-front general place
to one of the subsequent specifics and thereby depriving it of its intended
function. Baptism as appeal to God (1 Peter <b>3</b>:21) was intended to
include the meaning associated with the sinner’s prayer.</span></p>

reconciliation. Instead, we say <u>identity with Christ is the condition for

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Over the centuries several
practices and concepts have arisen that we deem foreign to the interpersonal
character and purpose of the new covenant, hence, foreign to the interpersonal
nature and purpose of its ordinances. These shifts have gone in two directions
especially: the ordinances have too often been reinterpreted as parts of (1) <u>legal</u>
process and/or (2) <u>natural</u> operation. In so treating them, interpreters
have introduced foreign elements. Beliefs and practices that stem from
contextualizing the ordinances in legal and natural frameworks are not only
foreign but contradictory to New Testament teaching. There is no positive basis
for introducing such matters because the new covenant provides an interpersonal
context for its ordinances, because its purpose is to establish interpersonal
consequences, and because the originating factors in each person’s observance
are “person-al.” A problem must be solved in the realm of that problem. Since
the problem exists in interpersonal matters (alienation), any actions involved
in its solution must be interpersonal (reconciliation). Interpersonal results
do not come about by impersonal means; ndo they do not come about by legal or
natural means.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              The interpersonal
character of Christian ordinances, among other things, makes infant baptism
unnatural. <b>(a)</b> Infant baptism cannot originate from the interpersonal
factors prerequisite to an interpersonal ordinance. The meaning of a formal act
is nullified by the absence of appropriate behavioral factors. The infant has
no <u>personal faith</u>, and a personal relationship cannot be established by <u>proxy
faith</u>, <u>subsequent faith</u>, <u>non-content faith</u>. An infant cannot
make personal commitment to Christ, and personal commitment cannot be made by
proxies. The faith of another cannot stand for a person’s own faith except in
legal transaction, but Christian ordinances stand in a grace-faith covenant. A
formal act in an interpersonal context has no meaning except as a performative
act; consequently, it means something only if the person means something into
it. Since infants cannot mean anything into the ordinance, baptizing infants
has no meaning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Besides the observation
that infants cannot do what baptism is, they have no need for what it involves.
<b>(b)</b> Infant baptism cannot be for the forgiveness of personal guilt
because none exists yet. An infant cannot yet operate responsibly about
morality, and morality belongs only to interpersonal contexts. <b>(c) </b>Infant
baptism cannot be for the forgiveness of someone else’s sin—original sin—because
guilt is personal. In personal relations, guilt and penalty that come from
personal action are no more transferable than the action itself. Baptism cannot
have any value for forgiving “original guilt” because there is no way to
transfer such guilt to him except by legal assignment; but legal assignment is
foreign to interpersonal need, process, and consequence. Obviously, racial
guilt is denied here in any sense that precludes divine fellowship and eternal
destiny.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <b>      (d)</b> Baptism is
not the outward sign of an external covenant because the new covenant is not an
external covenant, it does not have an external component, and its “sign” is
not simply an external act. It is a covenant in which everyone under it must
know the Lord to get into it. </span></p>

(proxy baptism)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Interpersonal
relationships are interpersonally established. Proxy baptism is thoroughly
legal. By the nature of interpersonalism, one person’s faith or obedience
cannot substitute for another’s. Legitimizing such a substitution requires
moving outside the interpersonal realm of the problem in order to invoke a
legal solution to it. Since baptism does not relate to legal operations, it
cannot be fulfilled by a proxy functionary. The seven sons of Sceva found out
that Christianity does not accomplish its purposes by the magical invocation of
the name of Christ or by going through certain rituals. Baptism for the dead
breaches the principle of personal involvement in interpersonal operations as
well as the lack of inherent necessity for formal acts in interpersonal
operations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              As far as meaning is
concerned, baptism is done by the “candidate,” not by an administrator. Baptismal
validity is not <i><u>ex opere operato</u></i>, where validity does not hinge
on personal qualities in the administrator or candidate. What makes an
observance valid depends on the kind of observance it is. Personal observance
gets its validity from personal factors, but official administration belongs to
legal transaction. Making the validity of baptism dependent on duly ordained
clergy makes its validity like that of a wedding ceremony, which requires a
duly authorized officer of the law as well as official witnesses. Baptism does
not have to be performed “publicly” by a special person. Grace does not flow
through the church by way of official operatives, but directly from God to the
believer. Grace does not follow an institutional “flow chart”; it flows
interpersonally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Should <u>God</u> decide
to establish authorized administration, he would do so for practical rather
than theoretical reasons. His people would have to know that from positive
commandment because they could not know it by inference from first principles. We
know of no explicit or implicit teaching to that end in the New Testament. Anything
of a practical sort that the <u>church</u> comes up with must not pre-empt the
interpersonal reality in which Christian ordinances stand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Since the validity of
baptism does not depend on who assists in its observance, we see no reason for
refusing baptism performed by members of other Christian heritages or for
considering it “alien baptism.” As long as it is baptism, we have is no reason
or right to redo it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              The validity of baptism
does not depend on any particular wording pronounced with its observance. The
candidate’s basic understanding of its meaning establishes the validity of its
observance. Normally the problem over “correct” formula centers on the “trinity”
issue. Among Christian Churches, Churches of Christ, Disciples of Christ there
has been some latitude in views of the trinity and therefore on the manner in
which that understanding might affect the form and formula for baptism. At any
rate, the so-called “trinitarian” expression in Matthew <b>28</b> obviously
does not conflict with the “Jesus-only” statements in Acts. Since baptism is
not a legal transaction, there is no notion here of the “valid wording of the
contract.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In some quarters of the <u>ancient
church</u>, baptism came to be delayed as long as possible because Christians
did not know what to do with post-baptismal sins. That practice—along with
extreme unction—evidenced the tendency to view salvation as dealing with
previous sins rather than with sin as such, that is, with sins rather than broken
relationship because of sin. It was a quantifying approach to a relational
issue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In some quarters of the <u>modern
church</u>, baptism is sometimes delayed until a new believers get settled in a
congregation to whom they can witness their faith through baptism and where they
can serve and grow in the faith. This practice associates baptism with a
particular consequence rather than with the initial commitment; it does so as
something that identifies people with the visible church (or a part of it) more
than with Christ. It treats the consequences as a series spread out over time
rather than as aspects of one total event. The logical series—forgiveness, gift
of the Spirit, and membership in the body—gets correlated with chronological
sequence so that what were intentionally simultaneous and coextensive are
handled as if they were sequential and distinct. Identification with Christ is
the overwhelming emphasis in the New Testament, a stress that is more inclusive
than church membership. In fact, only 1 Corinthians<b> 12</b>:13 speaks of “baptism”
into the church, and there the apostle stresses the Spirit aspect of baptism
since he says, <i>“In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>13</span> If baptism is interpersonal with
Christ, it relates to something that logically precedes entering a group or
institution associated with that person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In ancient times the
practice of hemerobaptism (“daily baptism”) considered baptism a ceremonial
ablution meant to symbolize cleansing of sins committed since the last
cleansing. The reason for such a practice stems from associating salvation with
forgiveness of sins more than forgiveness of sin, the separated-from-God
circumstance. Perfect goodness is not inherently necessary in personal
relationships. In modern times people request rebaptism periodically because
they have sinned or sense a lull in their devotion to Christ. They turn to
baptism as a way of relieving perhaps a hypersensitive conscience. As a result,
baptism takes on the role that should be associated with ongoing repentance and
prayer.</span></p>

into finished business</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              On the opposite extreme
of hemerobaptism stands any impulse to regard baptism as related to finished
business. Interpersonal relationships cannot be finalized. Entering Christ is
not like receiving a high school diploma, which gives permanent status and
privileges even though recipients may forget most of what they learned to get
it. Interpersonal observances are not time-referenced. Law may validate for a
period of time like a driver’s license, or permanently like a college degree. But
personal relationships are processual, not categorical. When people establish
relationship, they give no thought to how long. Friendships do not
automatically last so long or last only so long. Initiation into friendship
with God ushers in commitment to a holy life of growth; it does not mean
obtaining certain desirable consequences and having them “for good.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Baptism does not
regenerate inherited natural depravity. We know of no biblical evidence for
such a meaning of the ordinance, and we see no positive basis for the doctrine
of natural depravity itself—at least in any sense or degree that precludes
personal response to the gospel.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>14</span> There
is nothing involved here like an “infused grace.” Such an idea moves salvation
into ontology and attempts to invoke miracle to solve alienation. It does so
despite the lack of clear teaching that Adam’s spiritual capacity after his sin
differed from what it was before in a biologically inheritable sense. Baptism
does not enable people to have faith by miracle; it expresses the mustard-seed
faith they already have through personal influence. We do, of course,
acknowledge the psychological depravity that arises from factors personally
produced rather than genetically transmitted. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              <b>(a)</b> Considering
baptism inherently necessary would misunderstand the nature and purpose of
formal acts. Interpersonal processes require no particular formal acts. Establishing
identification with God, therefore, requires no ordinance at all. If one is
instituted, it is for the person’s benefit, not for God’s benefit or for the
system’s operation. An ordinance serves to focalize meaning, concretize
significance, clarify the invisible, make the abstract tangible. Christian
ordinances are performed because they are interpersonally appropriate, not
because they are legally, rationally, or naturally necessary. We are not to
take a <i>sine qua non</i> attitude toward ordinances. In a sense, ordinances
are “necessary” acts, but only because God has instituted them, not because he
had to institute them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <b>      (b)</b> Considering
baptism inherently necessary would also misunderstand the nature and purpose of
God himself. God is a person and therefore operates like one; he does not
operate with the rigidness characteristic of law, nature, or thought. He takes
into consideration intent of action, attitude of persons, and purpose of
operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              These two observations
about necessity enable Christians to generalize salvation principles to
practical situations not specifically dealt with in the New Testament. Circumstances
sometimes do not make baptism possible—or do not make it possible without risk
to life or health. A repentant believer committed to Jesus Christ might die
without baptism through some misunderstanding or insuperable circumstance. It
may not be clear whether a young person with a terminal condition has yet
attained the age of accountability. Persons committed to Christ may honestly
misunderstand that baptism should have been their own conscious response or
should have been an act of immersion. For purposes of fellowship and Christian
unity, situations like these must be dealt with. They should not get
interpreted like a case where someone has not filled out properly all the right
documents for a passport. They must be dealt with by inferences based on the
nature of the new covenant and the redemptive purpose of the holy, loving God who
instituted ordinances and knows the hearts of those who diligently seek him. All
the while, each believer strives both to teach and learn the Lord’s will more
perfectly on this and other issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In matters of personal
relationship formal matters can be overlooked entirely for legitimate,
practical reasons. The situation with baptism is analogous to Paul’s treatment
of circumcision in Romans <b>2</b>:25-29. Both circumcision and baptism are
formal acts related to spiritual relationships. Circumcision, of course, had
two aspects to it, one national and the other spiritual. Baptism does not have
the national aspect to it, but it does parallel circumcision in its spiritual
associations—as in identifying an adult proselyte with Israel and therefore
with the values and purposes expressed in God’s constitution for that nation. Speaking
of circumcision in its spiritual dimension, Paul observes, <i>“If then the
uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted
for circumcision?”</i> (Romans<b> 2</b>:26). Paul may have in mind godfearers,
or <i>sebomeno</i><u>i</u>, like Cornelius (Acts <b>10</b>:2, 22, 35; <b>13</b>:16,
26; note<b> 15</b>:7-9). These people worshipped the one true God, but had not
been circumcised to become proselytes and so considered full-fledged Jews. In
light of <b>2</b>:6-16, Paul may also have in mind more distant people who had
only conscience to guide them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In speaking about the <u>spiritual</u>
aspect of circumcision, Paul says that not conforming to the values and
purposes in God’s revelation changes a Jew’s circumcision to uncircumcision.
Conversely, conforming to them changes a Gentile’s uncircumcision into
circumcision. Paul does not explain why this is so, but we infer that it is so
by the nature of the case: personal relationships do not depend on formal
observances. Matters of the heart—sincerity, motivation, attitude—override the
lack of formal observance under appropriate conditions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Paul is quite bold here.
He does not treat this circumstance in a <u>neutral</u> way by saying that God
will deal with uncircumcised persons in a just manner. That would leave the
matter open-ended, and the legal inference could still be made that
uncircumcised people were lost because of their uncircumcision. Instead, Paul
treats the “pious uncircumcised” in a <u>positive</u> way, affirming that
because of their keeping God’s ordinances God reckons their uncircumcision as
circumcision. His comment is reminiscent of a later one about Abraham, who in
his uncircumcision had faith/trust reckoned for righteousness (Romans <b>4</b>:3,
9-12). The righteousness Abraham had came from interpersonal considerations
(faith/trust, promise) rather than <u>legal</u> ones. So also the consequent
blessings of the patriarch and his role among men grew from interpersonal
considerations: <i>“Not through <u>law</u> was the promise to Abraham or his
seed”</i> (<b>4</b>:13). Legal and interpersonal are different kinds of systems
(Romans<b> 4</b>:14-16; Galatians <b>3</b>:10-12). Even the <u>absence</u>,
then, of formal considerations like circumcision the apostle affirms is
overlooked under appropriate circumstances in spiritual matters, or as we are
saying, in interpersonal systems. If an action can even be set aside under
legitimate circumstances, it has a different meaning and type of necessity than
an act done in a legal system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Of course, it is “necessary”
to do what God tells us, and so baptism can be said to be necessary in that “interpersonal”
sense. That is simply part of acknowledging the lordship of Christ in
conversion. But most cases we have to deal with come up because of honest <u>mis</u>obedience
rather than intentional <u>dis</u>obedience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              No correlation should be
drawn between <u>baptism and outward action</u>. For one thing, valid outward
responses arise from corresponding internal factors they express. Furthermore,
no clear line can be drawn between overt behavior and inner commitment. Finally,
visible obedience reciprocates with invisible motivation. Separating inner and
outer seems as artificial in the theology of baptism as it does anywhere else
in Christianity.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>15</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              There are no shortcuts
to personal relationships and no artificial substitutes for what it takes to
have the real thing. Even as a relational process involves actions on both
sides of the relationship, so also it involves both inner and outer actions on
both sides of it. As already noted, no correlation should be drawn, then,
between <u>baptism as outer action and visible church membership</u>. If
baptism is a performative act, it is not just an outward act. The inner self
must mean something into the visible expression for it to have any meaning at
all. Baptism as outer action not only makes an unnatural distinction between
inner and outer, it makes an unnatural distinction between salvation and the
church—between the invisible church of the saved and the visible church as a
religious community. Baptism, outer action, and visible church membership do
not constitute a set. Instead, baptism identifies persons personally with
Christ up front at the level of the whole, not with any particular consequent
within it. Those particulars come from God only in consequence of
identification with the whole, that is, with Christ.</span></p>

inner and outer response can correspond also with not dividing between <u>water
baptism and S/spirit baptism</u>, depending on how the latter expression is
understood. If <i>“baptism in the Spirit”</i> is taken as alternative
terminology for <i>“gift of the Spirit,”</i> it refers to what we have called
the second consequence of identification with Jesus Christ. S/spirit baptism
would then be simultaneous with commitment to Christ in so-called “water
baptism.” The aspects of a real whole may be distinguishable mentally, but they
are not separated in the reality itself. In another direction, since outer does
not correlate particularly with works, legal operation, and baptism, inner does
not correlate particularly with faith, ontic operation (miraculous regeneration
by the Spirit), and Spirit baptism. Scripture itself never uses the expression “water
baptism” in reference to Christian baptism.<span style='position:relative;

joins (water) baptism and the Spirit into one statement: <i>“In one Spirit we
were all [water?] baptized into one body.”</i> We prefer, then, to consider
inner and outer responses and consequences as facets of the same whole event. </span></p>

with legal and ontological means or ends, but with interpersonal ones. Interpersonal
consequences come from interpersonal antecedents. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Everything applies to communion that
we said earlier about the <u>nature</u> and <u>purpose</u> of the new covenant
and the personal <u>origin</u> of its ordinances. The Lord’s Supper is <u>interpersonal</u>,
not legal or natural. It is a <u>performative</u> act; in observing it the believer
“makes a statement” (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:26).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

Reaffirmation of Identity with Jesus Christ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        As baptism is a performative
act that expresses personal identification with Jesus Christ, so also communion
is a performative act that expresses personal <u>re</u>-identification with
Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:16-22). As a <u>participation</u> with
Christ it re-affirms everything that identity implies about commitment to the
values and purposes of Christ. It is an individual’s act of worship that
normally takes place within the corporate life of Christians. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The participant consciously
and implicitly means into this formal observance a number of sub-meanings. The
bread and fruit of the vine represent the body and blood the Lord gave in
providing a basis for reconciliation. In the Supper there is <u>perception</u>
of this meaning in these emblems. The partaker ingests the elements as a <u>memorial</u>
of Christ’s death (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:23-24) and a <u>proclamation</u> of
it (<b>11</b>:26); he symbolically takes into himself the same degree of
commitment to God’s will for him that Christ himself demonstrated in his
original self-sacrifice. In this time of <u>self-examination</u> (<b>11</b>:28),
the communicants make anew their <u>pledge</u> of allegiance (<b>11</b>:23-25)
and imply a <u>prophecy</u> of Christ’s return (<b>11</b>:26). Observed by the
fellowship together, communion is a <u>plea</u> for Christian unity until that
time (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:16-17, 21). In summary, the Supper has three
dimensions: (a) upward, (b) outward, and (c) inward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <u>Infant observance</u> does
not fit with interpersonalism for the same reasons given earlier in connection
with infant baptism. Infant observance does not even involve personal
awareness, much less recommitment, self-examination, discerning the body, plea
for unity, and so on. The idea of <u>periodic cleansing from sin</u> likewise
does not belong to interpersonal operations for the reasons given earlier under
periodic rebaptism. Relationships are not time-referenced or individuated. It
takes legal principles to validate such practices, but legal procedures do not
effect interpersonal consequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        In most circumstances <u>observance
by non-Christians</u> presents no difficulty, because they usually do not
participate in religious events alien to their beliefs. Most cases of this sort
deal with whether a person is actually a Christian. Young people growing up in
Christian homes would not naturally take an interest in the Lord’s Supper any
sooner than they would take an interest in commitment and love of him. It seems
natural, then, to correlate re-identification with original identification in
these instances. The main concern is to avoid situations where observance is
superficial and undiscerning so people do not “drink condemnation” to
themselves. Young people who show an interest in partaking of the Lord’s Supper
might do so more in the sense of worship, as they do in singing songs about God
and Christ and what the commitment to him involves. In such a framework where
parents are explaining the meaning of the observance, it seems that the young
person is acting appropriately at a level of understanding that may be somewhat
less advanced than in the commitment they will make in baptism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        The doctrine of <u>real
presence</u> in all its forms is foreign to interpersonal concerns of
interpersonal ordinances. Transubstantiation, consubstantiation, and impanation
deal with ontological matters rather than relational ones. In these concepts,
transformation takes place in the emblems themselves, not in the mind of the
communicant. In the meal of remembrance, however, the partaker regards
unleavened bread and fruit of the vine as the body and the blood of the Lord. The
elements represent, not become. We see no positive biblical basis for
considering them anything other than meaningful symbols of significant
realities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Participation in Christ’s
Supper is an act of worship that affirms identification with Christ and
commitment to him. By the nature of the case, the only “qualification” for
participation is loving Christ. The eucharist is no more associated with a
particular congregation than baptism is. Neither ordinance identifies with the
church or the local church, but generally with the Christ of the one church. Denominational
affiliation has no relevance to this matter because his church is not
denominated. Christians no more partake of communion relative to a denomination
than they are baptized into a denomination. Consequently, any occasion of
observance is open to any Christian that is present, a practice called “open
communion.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        2.   Weekly observance</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              Congregations of the “Restoration
Movement” are rather unique among evangelicals in observing of the Lord’s
Supper each week. Communion as a specific act of gathered worship evidently had
the same frequency among early Christians as their gathered worship itself. The
clearest New Testament indication of the practice comes from a combination of 1
Corinthians <b>16</b>:1-2 and <b>11</b>:17-20ff. The first passage shows that
the Corinthians met each week on Sunday; the second passage indicates that the
agape feast was part of what happened when they met. Acts<b> 2</b>:42 includes <i>“breaking
the bread”</i> with fellowship, apostles’ teaching, and prayers when it speaks
of some things the first Christians <i>“continued steadfastly”</i> doing. Since
Luke’s account refers to a relatively brief time period, we infer that they
broke bread more often than once a year or every few months, especially since
he combines it with other religious activities done more frequently than that. Weekly
communion is no more and no less clear than weekly worship in general. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              There is no thought of
frequency in a legal sense. Missing communion is like missing church. It is not
so much a sin as a failure to avail oneself of an opportunity for mutual <i>“exhortation
to love and good works”</i> (Hebrews <b>10</b>:24-25). Interpersonal acts,
formal and otherwise, increase in meaningfulness the closer persons grow
together. In this same spirit, persons identified with Christ grow in their
commitment to him through their continued reaffirmation of that identity
formally and dynamically.</span></p>

the distinction intended here between cause and condition, see Virgil Warren’s <i>What
the Bible Says About Salvation</i> (Joplin, Missouri: College Press, l982), pp.
194-216. In general, a condition involves a <u>dependent first person</u> who
can do nothing decisive about his need, a <u>sovereign second person</u> who is
under no obligation to meet that need, a <u>free promise</u> to help, an <u>obedience
commanded</u> to the person in need, and a <u>result bestowed</u> by the other
person. A condition precedes the result but does not cause it directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part. Under conditionality, antecedent acts are
performed, but consequent results are given. <u>Conditionality</u> is an
interpersonal construct; it involves one person’s active trust in another
person’s free promise to give. Under <u>works</u>, there is no second person,
no promise, and no bestowed result. In this case the result is the
righteousness prerequisite to being viewed as righteous so there can be
fellowship with the Righteous One. The result comes directly and only from one’s
own continuous obedience to all elements of the standard for righteousness (Galatians
<b>3</b>:10-12). </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span>Mark
<b>16</b>:16 presents a technical exception if accorded textual integrity. Even
there, of course, identification with Christ comes into the picture. Belief and

if baptism were connected with a consequent specific like forgiveness, it would
not have the character of a “work” in the Pauline sense. It would be a <u>condition</u>,
whereas works are <u>causes</u>. As suggested by Habakkuk <b>2</b>:4 and
Genesis <b>15</b>:6, “faith” is Paul’s code word for the interpersonal
situation; “works” is his code word for the legal situation (Romans <b>3</b>:28).
Inner and outer actions occur in both situations, but “works” are actions done
in the context of law; hence, they have <u>causal</u> significance under law,
because continuously doing everything commanded in the Law produces the person’s
own perfect righteousness. In faith, however, people only “have faith” that their
active <u>concern</u> for righteousness will be viewed graciously by the other
Person and reckoned for what it seeks to be rather than is.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11</span>Modern
views of baptism have been historically conditioned. In the medieval church,
salvation had come to be viewed and practiced in legal, institutional terms,
and baptism along with it. By way of reaction, salvation—at least in some ways—began
to be moved out of legal procedure; but since baptism had meantime been
construed as a legal act, that feel for it continued. As a result, it was
associated with the only thing in Christianity that could have the appearance
of legality—church membership. Church membership, however, is a subsequent
specific; and so there have been those who reacted again by associating baptism
with a more important specific, namely, forgiveness of sins. This whole
scenario has erred in two ways: (1) by making baptism a legal act and (2) by
associating baptism with a specific consequence. The method of solution erred
by being reactive rather than positive: It reacted to the contemporary
situation (reformation) rather than making a positive start from New Testament
teaching about first principles (restoration).</span></p>

historical group of fellowships that designate themselves the “restoration
movement” are rather unique among evangelicals in not having a doctrine of <u>natural
depravity</u>. They have not seen in the historic fall any biblical indication
that people have incurred an inheritable loss of ability in spiritual matters
over what they had before Adam sinned. In its place they have put what can be
called <u>psychological depravity</u>, which comes from each person’s own
ingrained experience rather than from someone else’s inbred defect. What has
come about by personal experience can be overcome by personal influence in contrast
to supernatural miracle. The universal sinfulness of people and their inability
to save themselves have been explained on other grounds than as results of
depravity in ontic capacity. See <i>What the Bible Says About Salvation</i>,

self-salvation.</span></p>

Paul, works and faith do not correspond with inner and outer so as to make
baptism a work. Works and faith differ by the settings in which they occur (law
and interpersonalism respectively) and by the kind of connections they have
with consequences (cause and conditionality respectively). The point is not
what acts people do, but why they do them; the issue is what meaning and
purpose the acts have, and how they relates to consequences. Such things are
determined by the kind of system in which the acts stand, not by whether the
acts are internal or external.</span></p>

Christian baptism is not simply John’s baptism plus the gift of the Spirit. The
twelve disciples of John in Acts <b>19</b>:1-7 were baptized in the name of
Jesus, which shows that the meaning of the two baptisms were parallel, not
hierarchical. They had parallel meanings because they identified with separate
persons. At most, John’s baptism was a repentance baptism with consequent
forgiveness of sins. Christ’s baptism involves consequent forgiveness <u>and</u>
relationship with the Spirit on the basis of identity with Christ. </span></p>
