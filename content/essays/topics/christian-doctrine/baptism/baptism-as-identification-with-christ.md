<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Seeing baptism as
identification with Christ provides a framework for working through several <u>abnormal
situations</u> that arise and helps make sense even of <u>normal situations</u>
that may be overlooked in the theory and practice of the ordinance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Addressing first the normal
situation, we observe clear cases of baptism that do not move lost people into
a saved condition: righteous Jews called to John’s baptism for remission of
sins, saved disciples of John called to Christian baptism, and the baptism of
Jesus himself by John. Such examples show that Christian—and even Johannine—baptism
has a bigger frame of reference than salvation from lostness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            These examples help us
understand baptizing young persons raised in Christian homes. The children may
never have seen themselves as anything but Christians and may have shown a
devotion to Christ that is more than exemplary for someone his age. We do not
have to wait till they are obviously lost before we baptize them into Christ for
remission of sins. What if we become lost and then do not get them baptized in
time? There is no clear way of knowing how God regards them at any particular
point in their life. The point is that they identify themselves with Christ in
a mature way—totally, exclusively, and permanently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Seeing baptism as
identification with Christ means that we do not have to adopt an understanding
of the ordinance that requires people to be lost before they obey. We can deal
sensitively and realistically with non-standard situations that have been
thrown into contemporary ministry by the mispractices of the church historically.
In particular, we do not have to tell (or imply to) paedobaptists that they are
lost in their coming to baptism. In good conscience they can act on their
adjusted understanding without implying that they are now lost, that friends
and family and previous God-fearing ministers were likewise unsaved, that their
own previous Christian experience was a delusion. When we create such doubts,
we set them up for future uncertainty about the reality of their future
Christian experience. From a practical standpoint, we may also create the
adverse effect in that they may decide not to be baptized lest in so doing they
violate their own conscience before God. They end up in a catch 22: they cannot
obey without disobeying; they cannot obey without lying about what they think of
their earlier experience and yet they now believe that baptism is immersion and
a personal act of identification with Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Simply put, the idea is that
we call people to personal commitment to Christ. Baptism is a commanded formal
expression of that identification. On the basis of that identity, God gives
whatever benefits were previously not possessed in his eyes. He may have
regarded as sons those who were obedient to a previous stage of progressive
revelation, those who have not yet reached an age of full accountability, those
who had been mistaught or untaught on baptism matters, and yea even those who
had only general revelation and conscience as previous guides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            To those who were previously
lost, identification with Christ—and hence the formal act of that
identification—would bring forgiveness of sins, the gift of the Spirit, and
membership in the body of believers. To those whose sins were forgiven
(disciples of John), it would bring the Spirit and membership in the body, and
so forth. We do not have to make judgment <u>in practice</u> or <u>even in
theory</u> about the previous possession of any of those graces when we call
people to Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This approach applies
progressive revelation—a relativity factor—to all categories of people and
circumstances. As patriarchs were held responsible for what they had available
but not for Mosaic legislation, and as Israelites were held responsible for
Mosaic revelation but not for New Testament revelation, as children are held
responsible for what they can understand but not for adult matters, so also the
as-yet unevangelized—may we say—are responsible for what they have available to
them in nature, experience, culture, and conscience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That same
progression-relativity principle applies not only <u>throughout the
dispensations of time</u> and <u>across the boundaries of cultural circumstance</u>,
but also <u>over the stages of each person’s development</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We may say in closing that
this approach may relate to other matters in the New Testament: (1) the coming
of the Spirit on the household of Cornelius a short time before their baptism
that identified them with Christ; and (2) Ananias’ addressing the great
persecutor of Christians as “<i>Brother Saul.”</i> This expression could be a
term of affection or based on his being a fellow Jew. But by the time Ananias
says it, Paul was a repentant believer in Christ as the Messiah; he had seen
Christ and had been praying and fasting for three days. In attitude he was no
longer against Christ, and in that sense was for him. (3) It could relate to
the apostles’ receiving the Spirit on Pentecost aside from being baptized.</span></p>
