weight: 3
---



I.	Types of Occurrences: divine miracle, demonic miracle, answered prayer, psychological,

magic


II.	Characteristics of Biblical Miracle

A.	Many: <em>vs.</em> occasional

B.	Immediate: <em>vs</em>. taking place over a period of hours, days, or months as perhaps in

natural healing

C.	Always successful: <em>vs.</em> occasional success as perhaps something merely unusual

D.	Varied: <em>vs</em>. just certain kinds of things that might be more easily faked or misread

1.  healing all kinds of diseases and deformities: Acts <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:16

2.  nature miracles: stilling the tempest (Matthew <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:23-27)

3.  exorcisms of demons

4.  foreknowledge (across time): Luke <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:7-13

5.  from a distance (across space): Matthew<strong> 8</strong>:5-13

6.  special miracles: by way of objects carried from the person (Acts <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:11)

7.  not dependent on the faith of the one affected: Malchus (John <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:10-11)

E.	Permanent: <em>vs</em>. something that “wore off” as perhaps with psychological effects

F.	Beneficial: not harmful or detrimental to the persons involved

Note, however, cases where miracles were used to curb evil and opposition.

G.	Positive: not sheer demonstration of supposed supernatural power (levitation, bending

objects, swallowing razor blades, eating fire, <em>etc</em>.)

sometimes without contact

H.  Secondary: <em>vs</em>. the center of the miracle worker’s activity

secondary to proclamation of a message

I.	Purposeful: <em>vs</em>. entertainment

to prove the claim of the miracle worker;

to increase faith in the one benefitted

J.	Extreme: obviously not by natural cause

blind from birth, lame from birth, resurrection, leprosy

K.	Simple: merely with a word, not an elaborate process that involved agonizing to create

the effect (as in elaborate exorcisms; Matthew<strong> 8</strong>:16; Lk. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:7)

L.	Altruistic: free <em>vs</em>. done for the benefit of the miracle worker—for money, fame,<em> etc</em>.

Perhaps not even done on Christians: Trophimus (2 Timothy <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:20) and

Epaphroditus (Philippians. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:25-27) (?)

M.	Public: <em>vs</em>. known by rumor
