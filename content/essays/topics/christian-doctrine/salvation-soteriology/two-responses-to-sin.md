<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sin involves two issues that correspond to the two
sides of a sin situation. There is the doing of a moral wrong and the reacting
to a moral wrong. Because sin takes place between people, there is the person
who does evil and the one who suffers evil. In resolving that circumstance,
repentance happens on one side and forgiveness happens on the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            What
happens, though, when there is no repentance? The basic principle seems to be
that <i>“where there is no repentance there is no forgiveness.”</i> What people
have done in the past they would do again unless they have changed, or
“repented.” Without a change of mind, a change of heart, a change of resolve to
behave differently, they are the same as they were when they sinned. Since “sin
separates,” the separation continues because nothing has changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Under
the lofty expectations of Christian living, people can feel bad for not
forgiving people even though the people have not changed. Forgiving them would
seem to condone their behavior; yet it feels wrong somehow to be “unforgiving.”
In response to that dilemma, we observe that the Greek word for “forgive” (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀ</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>φίημι)
has a word picture that includes two ideas rather than just the one we call
“forgiveness.” In addition, there is <i>“letting go of something”</i> instead
of forgiving someone. The word picture in </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀ</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>φίημι is “to
throw something away.” In that light, we offer these comments about appropriate
responses to sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Scripture
distinguishes between kinds of sin and whether past sin continues to be
“reckoned.” There is not only the sin; there is the reckoning of it as well. There
are (a) <u>sins of ignorance</u>, which we do not hold against people—at least
as long as they are ignorant (Luke <b>23</b>:34; Acts <b>7</b>:60; <b>14</b>:16;
<b>17</b>:30; cp. Romans <b>2</b>:12-13; <b>3</b>:25). When they become aware, they
become responsible; they become responsible for separating themselves from it
by repenting of it. Ignorance situations include “secret faults” (Psalm <b>19</b>:12),
faults the doers are not aware of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Sins
of ignorance” implies a difference in the moral quality of an act. It is people’s
hearts that determines whether other people view their acts as sin and continue
to “hold it against them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There
are (b) <u>sins done under the pressure of the moment’s temptation</u>. Doers may
repudiate them later when the pressure is off and they “come to their senses.” John’s
“sin not unto death” (1 John <b>5</b>:16-17) appears to be a case in point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There
are (c) <u>sins that people later repent of</u>, in which case—for relationship
purposes—it is as if they had not done them. The past cannot be changed, but
its impact on the present can be removed, and life together can continue as
before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There
are (d) <u>sins with a high hand</u> (Number <b>15</b>:30; cp. Hebrews <b>6</b>:4-6;
<b>10</b>:26). They are deliberate; the people know what they are doing. If all
manner of sin except “blasphemy of the Holy Spirit” is forgivable (Matthew <b>12</b>:31-32;
Mark <b>3</b>:28-30; Luke <b>12</b>:10), then presumably deliberate sin is
forgivable too on the condition of repentance later. Under this last category
belongs characteristic sin, or sin unto death, for which people do not pray for
other people’s forgiveness (1 John<b> 5</b>:16). If doers depart from such a
pattern, then the nature of it changes to (c), sins later repented of. Evidently
this category may include “blasphemy of the Holy Spirit” as well. <i>“Repenting
of it in the next world/age”</i> is not effective unto divine pardon because
the period of condition has run out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On
the other side of the interpersonal relationship, the meanings of <i>aphiēmi</i>
apply. The other person—or an “on-looker/bystander against whom the same
behavior could be addressed—has two options. Forgiveness is the most ideal
because it leads to a resolution and implies a change of heart and resolve on
the sinner’s part. Sin separates; repentance reconciles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The
other reaction is “letting go of it,” not reckoning it against a person in the
first place or overlooking it. This applies notably to sins of ignorance, but
it applies as well to all categories of sin, regardless of degree or kind,
motive or consequence. “Letting go of it” is involved in every case where
someone is wronged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The
purpose of forgiveness is to restore social relations; the purpose of <i>“letting
go of it”</i> is to preserve the emotional well-being of the one wronged. Forgiveness
benefits the sinner and the self; “letting go of it” benefits the self. Forgiveness
responds to the other person; “letting go of it” responds to the other person’s
act. <i>“Letting go of it”</i> contrasts with forgiveness because it is not
aimed at restoring relationship. “Letting go of it” provides an alternative to
allowing sin to “eat on us,” “get us down,” “turn us sour.” Psychologically it
puts the person above the circumstance—like going two miles when compelled to
go one. It subjectively gets rid of the act so it cannot continue to do us
harm, but it does not get rid of the broken relationship caused by the sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>“Letting
go of something”</i> is a lesser response than forgiving, but it is indeed
something significant.<i> “Letting go of it”</i> is not the same thing as
“letting it go” in the sense of letting it pass as if it does not matter. It is
not appropriate to treat unrepentant people as if they did not do anything
wrong. Such a reaction would only embolden them to keep it up. Letting it go
does not call them to responsibility; it does not maintain the standards of
rectitude and the conditions of personal relationship; it can even endanger the
other person’s well-being, character, and reputation. The more extreme the sin
the more serious these results may be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>“Letting
go of it”</i> can in fact lead to forgiveness since it creates a void of
relationship the other person may come to see as a meaningful loss. Letting go
of it can have the value intended in church discipline and disfellowshiping. Letting
go of it can lead to (repentance and) forgiveness also because sinners do not
get a sense of gaining the upper hand; they can see that they are the loser by
having lost the positive things that were there previously. “Letting go of it”
does not condone the doer’s act, but it does not forgive it either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As
a postscript, there are practical considerations in any real sin circumstance. (a)
Sometimes we cannot be sure what the motive behind the act was. The person
sinned against is not always privy to whether it happened out of ignorance or
under temptation’s duress. Under such conditions people can let it go without
breaching their responsibility to the standards of rectitude and at the same
time not communicate to sinners that they can continue doing as they please
without it making any difference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another
practical consideration, especially in light of the previous one, is how to
proceed in rebuilding the relationship. It makes sense to renew it the same way
it was established. First, people that are wronged can venture a certain degree
of trust; and when that proves positive, they can increase the trust as the
other persons proves trustworthy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Such
a pattern provides a degree of self-protection against wolves in sheep’s
clothing, as Jesus’ saying goes. It contrasts with acting as if nothing had
happened and avoids the risk of being misused again. A forgiving person’s good
will can be taken advantage of. The sinner can <i>“pull the wool over other people’s
eyes.”</i> By “letting it go,” people are using good sense and better judgment
not to open themselves up to misuse and abuse again. They are being <i>“wise as
serpents and harmless as doves</i>”; <i>“they are not casting their pearls
before swine.”</i></span></p>
