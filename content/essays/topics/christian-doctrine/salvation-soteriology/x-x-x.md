color:black'>Your presentation follows the pattern used by Roman Catholic
missionaries and many others, where general revelation (through <u>nature</u>)&nbsp;and
theistic proofs bring&nbsp;someone to belief in God, his eternality,
omnipotence, and other natural attributes. Special revelation&nbsp;adds a
saving knowledge of God through Christ as holy, good, and loving&nbsp;(through <u>history</u>
regarding God’s moral attributes). The first&nbsp;format has its precursor in
Paul’s Areopagus speech; the second step follows Gamaliel’s argument in Acts <b>5</b>,
a resurrectiono-centric format in which the existence of the church and the
fact of Jesus’ resurrection stand or fall together: the church exists;
therefore, the resurrection occurred, Christ’s claim are true because
resurrection is supernatural, and miracle confirms the claims of the miracle
worker, <i>etc</i>. In the modern day, that two-step process has been enhanced
by increased awareness of the complexity of nature with its accompanying
tendency away from the likelihood that&nbsp;gradual change could explain
chemistry-to-man&nbsp;by “endogenous complexification,” upward&nbsp;increase
in&nbsp;complexity only by factors inside the natural order. <u>Natural
evolution</u> replaces the need—not the fact/disproof—of supernatural deity; so
it has become the apparent option for replacing the creationist model. A
relevant observation, I might add, is that it is not possible to put in
sequence the origin of reciprocating parts (especially for the level of
observable complexity&nbsp;culminating in human social relationships). </span></p>

color:black'>            The second step is also replaced by the evolution
model—<u>social evolution—</u>in&nbsp;which the Christian message developed to
become what we see in the New Testament, the&nbsp;belief system&nbsp;preserved
by&nbsp;getting associated with the Roman government&nbsp;that destroyed the
alternative traditions&nbsp;that descended from Jesus of Nazareth.&nbsp;The
difficulty here is that it does not&nbsp;square with&nbsp;the Roman persecution
of the church (rather than Gnosticism, <i>etc</i>.) and the lack of time for
this scenario to unfold. But these challenges to the theistic worldview and
Christian message are plausible enough to excuse people who do not want to
surrender autonomy. </span></p>

color:black'>A third format directly challenges the&nbsp;penchant&nbsp;for
human autonomy by starting with the subjective need of every person for
security, meaning, love, and innocence—needs that any thoughtful person
recognizes that dependent beings who die cannot provide for themselves. It
connects with the personal-interpersonal center we worked from in the study of
salvation. As a matter of fact, it corresponds also with the Calvinistic
approach that sets aside the use of apologetics altogether in the evangelistic
enterprise—but for other reasons legal (divine sovereignty) and anthropological
(human depravity). The person does his own comparison with alternative
worldviews so as to recognize intuitively that the gospel is “better,” and that
God must indeed be in&nbsp;what you are&nbsp;saying&nbsp;(cp. 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:24-25,
<i>“God is indeed among you.”</i>). We are not responsible for the “power” of
the gospel in contrast to other messages; we are responsible only for
presenting it correctly and appropriately.</span></p>

color:black'>This whole tangent&nbsp;about apologetics and Christian evidences
relates to the practical aspect of the class assignment. <u>Efficiency</u> is
always an issue in&nbsp;the witnessing&nbsp;endeavor. If people&nbsp;will listen
long enough to go through more involved presentations,&nbsp;they are “seekers”
at some level—and that is perfectly okay. Admittedly, it is doubtful that
any&nbsp;tactic will suffice with someone hardened against hearing by
the&nbsp;deceitfulness of self-sufficiency—the&nbsp;sin of autonomy (Hebrews <b>3</b>:17).
Such people may have to be knocked flat on their backs before they are in a
position to look to a higher, external&nbsp;basis&nbsp;for a fulfilling life.
The “friendship factor” in salvation suggests directly presenting people’s
problem&nbsp;as alienation and God’s solution&nbsp;as reconciliation. The
listeners on their own contrast it with their own approach&nbsp;to life if they
have one.&nbsp;<u>Then</u>, if&nbsp;they raise
counter-considerations,&nbsp;they become elements of discussion such as those
you touched on. Perhaps&nbsp;in confirmation of the relatively lower efficiency
of the&nbsp;approach is the observation that significantly more than half your
layout dealt with pre-salvation matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:

.5in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:black'> I did not&nbsp;notice any traces of matters we described&nbsp;in
class and in collateral readings. That is not in itself a “problem” since
nothing in the&nbsp;assignment called for incorporating such ideas. It does
suggest that the class approach to the topic did&nbsp;not impact what would
have been the presentation without having gone through the study. The phrase,
for instance, <i>“paying for sin”</i> (p. 8) is foreign to the alternate
approach, which says that <u>alienation itself</u> is the problem and that it
is not the kind of thing that can be <i>“paid for,”</i> certainly not by
someone else; one (righteous) person cannot <i>“pay”</i> by being alienated on
behalf of a (sinful) other one. We are not saved from the <u>consequences of
alienation</u>. God gives us up to the natural and social ramifications of sin
in that we receive in ourselves the “recompenses” of those sins, recompenses
that are not removed (Romans <b>1</b>:24-<b>2</b>:3ff.). If any recompense
gets&nbsp;removed, it is indirectly&nbsp;in consequence of the reconciliation
itself (with God) and the conversion&nbsp;from behaviors—behaviors being conditions&nbsp;both
for bringing about&nbsp;and removing alienation (with him and people): sin
changed to repentance and apology and righteousness can&nbsp;be conditions
for&nbsp;human forgiveness as well. So, the only thing God promises to save us&nbsp;from
is the alienation—which&nbsp;death and its precursors result from. That
reconciliation&nbsp;happens only because God&nbsp;himself freely chooses to
reckon us as righteous “friends” and spiritual “sons”&nbsp;on the condition
that we identify Christ his righteous Son (and the Father with whom&nbsp;Christ
is at one; John <b>10</b>:30; <b>17</b>:11). Only the Son embodies among us
what we must be willing to aspire to be like in kind and degree—bearing our own
crosses and resisting unto blood (Mathew <b>16</b>:24; Hebrews <b>12</b>:4).
Friendship with God (reconciliation) <u>is</u> the salvation, and it <u>alone</u>
is the salvation. <i>”Paying for alienation”</i>&nbsp;is not possible; <i>post
facto</i> restitution is the only thing a sinner might do,&nbsp;but
restitution&nbsp;can only be for some kinds of matters in <u>recognition</u> of
reconciliation rather than as <u>condition</u>&nbsp;for it and&nbsp;certainly
not as a&nbsp;<u>cause</u> of&nbsp;it so as to <i>“pay for”</i> it.</span></p>
