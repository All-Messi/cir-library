<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Salvation as reconciliation is
the most distinctive feature of Christianity. Herein lies the primary
difference between the gospel, on the one hand, and the Law, wisdom literature,
and the prophets, on the other. In this respect, Christianity differs from the
purposes of previous divine economies and from the goals of other religions and
human agendas. In Christ, God is concerned with more than letting people know that
he exists, what he is like, what his moral standards are, and what his expectancies
are within his purposes. Salvation is not simply from ignorance, as by
revelation; it is not deliverance from physical existence as in Gnosticism and
Eastern dualism; it is not a deliverance from individuality as in Hinduism. Salvation
is reconciliation from alienation and from all the negatives that come from
separation from God and other people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In keeping with
interpersonalism as the distinctive characteristic of the Christian worldview,
the following diagram summarizes under reconciliation the nature and pattern of
“salvation” as based on 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:14-21. It applies to both the
individual and corporate mankind.</span></p>

summarize his ministry (<b>5</b>:18-19) and the content of his message (<b>5</b>:18-20)
implies several things simultaneously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. “Reconciliation” implies
that salvation addresses an <u>interpersonal problem</u>; it aims to correct a
breakdown in social relations. Since God and mankind are both interpersonal,
there are vertical and horizontal dimensions to this issue. Reconciliation is
the reality involved in “salvation.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. <u>Alienation</u> is the
problem since that is the opposite of reconciliation in the interpersonal
category.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3. “<u>Salvation</u>” means
that a problem already exists by the time the Christian message enters the
picture. The concern is not prevention but cure. It is not just a matter of
telling people how to <u>live</u> or what to <u>hope</u> for, which was the
role of the Law plus wisdom literature and prophecy respectively. Salvation corrects
what has gone bad, and it is always harder to straighten out a condition than
to prevent it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            4. We know from experience
that alienation comes about from <u>sin</u>, that is, from behavior contrary to
a shared standard for behavior and action contrary to positive social relations.
Scripture says the same thing: <i>“Your sins have separated me and you”</i>
(Isaiah <b>59</b>:2; cp. Amos<b> 3</b>:3). Not only does the Bible use <i>sin</i>
as a term for (a) <u>behavior</u> contrary to a shared standard for behavior,
but also for (b) the <u>state</u> of estrangement that results from such
behavior, and (c) the psychological <u>condition</u> of bondage to sin as
ingrained sinful habit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            5. <u>Reconciliation</u>
assumes that God and man are both ethical beings, responsible for their
actions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The evolutionary format
differs from the diagram above by not starting with an ideal situation from
which people historically fell, but with an animal existence that did not have
interpersonal characteristics and capacities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> I. Aspects and Images of “Salvation”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The reality in salvation is
reconciliation. In that connection, scripture speaks of metaphors for
salvation, aspects of it, and consequences of it. The terminology below
includes expressions for (a) different aspects of the same larger whole and (b)
different figures, or word pictures, for that whole or some aspect of it. In
our explanation of the ideas, we give first the biblical usage and then note
other concepts that have become attached to these words in the history of
Christian thought—ideas that at times are more technical concepts and at other
times seem foreign to the biblical viewpoint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Salvation</u> itself is
really one picture of the subject it labels. It refers to restoring
relationships as retrieving from an unwholesome condition or
circumstance—saving. The Bible also uses “saving” imagery for political
deliverance, deliverance from physical danger, and medical cure. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Reconciliation</u> is the
opposite of alienation, estrangement, divorce, separation. It refers to
restoration after broken relationships. As such, reconciliation is most
precisely what “salvation” is all about. The latter term does not necessarily
conjure up “saving” from broken relationship and its subsequent problems. More
likely it brings to mind being saved from guilt, temporal punishment, physical
death, destruction in hell, and so forth. Consequently, reconciliation is a
richer term because it focuses on persons, relationship between persons,
restoring lost relationship between persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Healing</u> likens
reconciliation to physical healing. Healing imagery is also applied to
exorcising demons, removing moral faults, and resolving a country’s political
defects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Regeneration</u> looks at
the “starting over” element involved in reconciliation (John <b>3</b>:5 Titus <b>3</b>:5).
In historical theology this imagery has been loaded with a further concept that
derives from the idea of natural depravity. Regeneration in this sense refers
to the Spirit’s work of fixing the defective nature that we supposedly inherit
from our first parents by physical birth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Conversion</u> addresses
the “change” involved in becoming a Christian—a change of belief, perhaps, but more
importantly a change of attitude and motive and behavior that accompanies
reconciliation. If we hope to enter back into fellowship and continue in it, we
need to discard ways of acting that caused separation in the first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Repentance</u> is a
change of the mind, attitude, motives, and feelings that lead to a changed
life—conversion. It is a change that arises from sorrow for sin and leads to
reformation of life. Its value in restoring relationship lies in separating the
sinner from his past acts as far as he himself is concerned. Repentance says, <i>“That
is no longer the kind of person I am or want to be. I turn my back on such attitudes,
motives, and deeds.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Forgiveness</u> means no
longer holding past sins against the sinner; the one sinned against ceases to
allow previous behaviors to impact present relations. Forgiveness says, <i>“That
is no longer the kind of person I view you as being or wanting to be.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Remission</u> is an
alternative translation of the Greek word </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἄφεσις</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<i>aphesis),</i>
“forgiveness.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Faith</u> is the aspect
of reconciliation that “trusts” the person on the other side of the
relationship. Faith trusts that the other will be gracious, forgiving, no
longer reckoning sins. The sinner has to trust because, being the offender, he
has no recourse to gaining the other person’s good will. The offended is under
no obligation to overlook or forgive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Grace</u> is the aspect
of reconciliation that refers to the positive, loving attitude the offended
takes toward the offender. Grace withholds just punishment and even bestows
positive good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Fellowship</u> is
positive association with another person, a condition and pattern of
interaction that results from the reconciliation process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Adoption</u> compares
salvation to being given status in a family a person does not belong to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Justification</u> deals
with the change that takes place in God’s eyes toward us. It is legal imagery
for personal forgiveness by an offended party. It treats the removal of guilt
as a pronouncement made by the executor of the law—a pronouncement that says
the offender is viewed as just relative to the requirements in the standard of
behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Life</u> is meaningful existence
based on relationship to the superior Other and his purposes, all of which
leads to his blessing and a sense of well-being in the creature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Revelation</u> is the
objective effort of making the sinner aware of moral expectancies, of the “good
news” that failure in moral expectancies is not a one-way, dead-end street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Illumination</u>, also
translated <u>enlightenment</u>, is the subjective experience of profiting from
revelation. It is the part of reconciliation that senses the truth now properly
understood as well as the experience of the relationship itself along with its
blessings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Sanctification</u> draws
attention to the separation from all competing associations that must occur in
reconciliation and identification. Sanctification pictures salvation as being
set aside to special use and calling, the same word picture in the <i>holy</i>,
<i>sacred</i>, and <i>saint</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                              In
historical theology “sanctification” became a technical word that stresses the
quality of Christian living. Sanctification is a process of change by degrees
within the reconciled state in contrast to justification, which is regarded as
occurring at a point in time when the reconciled state begins. Justification is
monergistic (something done wholly by the other “One”) while sanctification is
synergistic (something done by God and person together). Justification is
operating grace; sanctification is cooperating grace. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In Wesleyan theology sanctification
is something also done only by God’s Spirit in what is called <i>“the second
definite work of grace.”</i> That second work follows regeneration, which was
the first definite work that removed enough inbred defect to enable initial
response to the gospel; in sanctification the Spirit removes the last vestiges
of inbred sin so the saved person can live a morally perfect life of love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Atonement</u> technically
refers to Christ’s role in the reconciliation process, although its biblical
usage has a broader reference. In the Authorized Version “atonement” rendered a
Hebrew root (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt'>כפר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>) that
pictured the removal of sins as “covering&quot; them up. In the New Testament
the Authorized Version used “atonement” only in Romans<b> 5</b>:11, where it
translated the Greek root (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀλλάσσω</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>allassō</i>) elsewhere rendered “reconcile/reconciliation.”
“Atonement” carries a word picture for unification after alienation: “at-one-ment.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Propitiation</u> pictures
as appeasement the removal of God’s displeasure, or “wrath,” at a person’s sin—an
appeasement based on identification with the Righteous One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Expiation</u>, a more
legal concept than propitiation, indicates the removal of guilt against the
standard in an impersonal sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Redemption</u> compares
salvation to buying someone out of slavery. In this case, salvation redeems
people from the stative and psychological bondage of sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Ransom</u>, another
translation for the Greek word rendered “redemption,” carries the notion of
delivering someone from the slave state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Election</u> draws
attention to the fact that the identity of those reconciled to God is based on
God’s “choice” to receive them rather than based on their deserving his favor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Imputation</u> means that
righteousness is not so much resident in the reconciled one as viewed upon him
by God, who accepts him back into fellowship and forgives sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Creation</u> emphasizes
the newness of a person’s condition and the primacy of the divine activity
involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            These terms include
metaphors, aspects, consequences, and reference to the general reality itself. The
basic <b>reality</b> is reconciliation. The <b>aspects</b> are conversion,
repentance, forgiveness/remission, faith, grace, revelation,
illumination/enlightenment, sanctification, atonement, election, and
imputation. The <b>consequences</b> are fellowship and life. The <b>metaphors</b>
are regeneration, salvation, healing, adoption, justification, sanctification, illumination/</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In a sense, all the aspects
and consequences could also be called metaphors in that all the terms have word
pictures. In this listing, the difference is that interpersonal realities are
aspects of the primary reality, reconciliation. Sometimes, as in “atonement,”
there is no word besides a word-picture term to refer to the aspect of the
reality that is there; so we have to list that term with the aspects. That
makes metaphors out of non-interpersonal verbiage used in connection with the
whole reconciliation process with its divine and human aspects. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The list contains some
paired terms, which correlate with the two sides of the divine-human
interactions involved. <u>Faith</u> trusts in <u>grace</u>; <u>illumination</u>

</span><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>repentance</span></u><span

Concept of Salvation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christianity conceives of
mankind’s primary <u>problem</u> as alienation; so, its <u>solution</u> is
reconciliation. The <u>means</u> of solution is repentance, conversion, and
identification with Christ, including commitment to his lordship, values, and
purposes to the extent he carried them out. Other worldviews have different
understandings of man’s fundamental problem and consequently other understandings
of the solution to it and different means of obtaining it. (See Virgil Warren, <i>What
the Bible Says About Salvation</i>, pp. 10-12.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The key point in evaluating
the alternatives to the Christian analysis of the human predicament is
determining what is central and what is less central. Several alternatives
identify matters that are indeed problems, but the difficulty comes in (a)
trying to make them central or in (b) the means by which they are supposedly
solved.</span></p>
