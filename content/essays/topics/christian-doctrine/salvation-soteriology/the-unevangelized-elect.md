<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The diagram above takes its cue from
Paul’s comments in Romans <b>2</b>. God can judge unevangelized people on the
basis of where their conscience has properly led them, the shaded area in the
diagram. For practical purposes in that non-standard situation, God can
disregard honest ignorance—where the conscience has misled and where it has
omitted the rest of what Christianity stands for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is not “another religion” that would be
saving such people if God decides to save them. It is, first of all, the area
of the <u>correct religion</u> that would be the basis for God’s saving them,
not the false religion as such. Secondly, it would be <u>God</u> who would save
them, not the people’s actions relative even to those beliefs wherein
conscience had led correctly. The people had not been perfect even in that
restricted area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The role of human action is not to <u>cause</u>
righteousness, because “nobody’s perfect” and righteousness means moral
perfection. Human action only meets the <u>condition</u> for God’s considering them
righteous in his own mind. No one is, so to speak, objectively righteous. The
real condition for fellowship with God is identifying with God, which people do
in large part by adopting God’s values and purposes. Attempting to live up to his
expectancy amounts to an attempt to identify with him as the one who originated
that expectancy. Normally we call people to identify with Christ as the one who
is what God wants us all to be and as the One who is himself identified with
the Father by being sent by him and doing his will. In the case of the
unevangelized—those we have not “called on,” that element could be omitted in
God’s mind for judgment purposes; he could deal with them directly on the same
principle—identification. Their attempt and desire to please God as best they
knew would be taken to indicate their desire for fellowship him, and that is
the essential condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Knowing about Christ is not inherently
necessary to being saved by Christ as shown by his being Savior of the people
during the Old Testament (Hebrews <b>9</b>:15) and any saved of those before it
(1 Peter<b> 3</b>:19-21;<b> 4</b>:6). Christianity then is an exclusive
religion, but those raised knowing only some other god the true God could save
because of their desire to please God in respect to where the false religion
has in part properly led them. That is really to say, they are saved relative
to the truth that Christianity is and the rest of what their religion taught could
be disregarded for judgment purposes. God could judge them by “the light that
they have.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Describing this possibility removes one
other criticism of the faith. God is wise enough to deal consistently with
non-standard situations.</span></p>
