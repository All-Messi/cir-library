<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Goodness has several
aspects. In relation to a <u>standard</u>, goodness is humanly measurable
behavior relative to the divine ideal—as to its “letter” and its “spirit.” As
to the <u>behavior</u>, goodness is the overt behavior (which tends to
correlate with what is humanly measurable) but the motive, attitude, and
character—generalized pattern <i>vs</i>. specific act. As to the <u>setting</u>,
goodness has a subjective and objective aspect. As to the <u>kind of
interpersonal behavior</u>, there is morality, wisdom, and ministry. These
dimensions of goodness are detailed under the headings below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (1)  <u>Behavior
relative to the humanly executable aspects of the Law of Moses</u>.  Paul
evidently means the Law in this sense when he says of himself, <i>“. . . as to
the righteousness that is of the Law—blameless” </i>(Philippians <b>3</b>:6);
otherwise, he would contradict the claim that <i>“there is none good but God”</i>
(Luke<b> 18</b>:19) as well as his own claim that <i>“All have sinned and <u>fall</u>
short of the glory of God”</i> (Romans <b>3</b>:23). The “humanly measurable”
must refer to the more <u>overt</u> and <u>quantitative</u> aspects of Mosaism,
because other people can judge and enforce them—what are actionable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            That corresponds with
the first function of the Law of Moses—to serve as the constitution of a
political entity, the Jewish state, which united church and state in a
theocracy. Here we are looking at a <u>humanly actionable aim</u> of
legislation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Perfection in this
respect is humanly attainable. But people cannot feel satisfied with living up
to the Mosaic Law in that respect, that <i>“letter of the law” </i>approach. There
is more to <i>“the righteousness of God”</i> than that, so the next category
comes into play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (2)  <u>Behavior
relative to the divine ideals set forth in the Law of Moses</u>. It is in this
respect that Paul evidently refers to the commandment not to covet (Romans <b>7</b>:7ff.).
No human can know the motives behind another person’s behaviors that fall short
of divine ideals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Perfection in this
second sense is not humanly attainable, and yet perfection is always required
by any standard of behavior, legal (Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:26) or
interpersonal.  The divinely measurable intent of the Law includes the heart;
God knows our heart as well as our actions (Luke<b> 16</b>:16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            This second function
of the Mosaic Law set God’s values for interpersonal relationship, including
human-divine relationship. This is the <u>guidance end</u> of the legislation,
the front end. Particularly in Mosaic legislation, there is a distinction
between the guidance aim (ideal/values) and the executable aim, not only
because one is attainable and the other one is not, but because the Mosaic Law
was given by a holy God (Leviticus <b>19</b>:2; cp. Galatians <b>3</b>:21).
Here is what Paul calls the “spirit” of the Law (2 Corinthians<b> 3</b>:6-11),
but this is still not the whole picture, because the spirit of the Law deals
with intent of the Law (see next entry). The ideals of the Law include such
lofty unmeasurable matters as loving God and neighbor with all our heart,
strength, and mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                        (a)  <u>Spirit
<i>vs</i>. letter of the Law</u>. The spirit of the Law (2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:6-11)
contrasts with the letter of the Law in both of the above dimensions. Here we
are concerned about the intent of statements in contrast to the strict wording.
Here we face an additional <u>linguistic issue</u>, the <u>nature of language</u>,
and then the hermeneutical endeavor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                        (b)  <u>Overt
and inner</u>.  Overt behavior contrasts with <u>motive</u>, <u>attitude</u>,
and <u>character</u> of the person—<u>intentions</u> <i>vs.</i> performance.
This aspect of the situation brings in an observation of the <u>nature of
people</u>. Paul addresses this matter in Romans <b>7</b>, where he pictures our
plight under divine ideals aside from any qualifying considerations, aside from
factors like grace/forgiveness in another to subjectively “make up for” the
lack of full congruity between intention and fulfillment “in the sinner.” His
ideals are better than his accomplishments. His own members, his “flesh,” get
in the way of fulfilling his aspirations, intentions, ideals, which equal the
real “me,” the inner self, the heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                        As an
unsupplemented principle, <b>law</b> leads to actual and psychological <u>separation
from God</u> (loneliness), <u>personal frustration</u> from goal achievement,
and <u>bondage to weakness</u>. The <b>interpersonal factor</b> must come in to
provide the grace of forgiveness by the other person to bridge the gap between
accomplishment and aspiration (Romans <b>7</b>), which is measured by
conscience (Romans <b>2</b>). Conscience, law, and interpersonal values are all
perfectionist, but the <u>interpersonal</u> provides grace—which <u>law</u>
does not—to relieve a <u>conscience</u> sensitized by those high ideals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (3) <u>Objective and
subjective goodness</u>.  There are two ways to be righteous—objectively (actually)
and subjectively (interpersonally). We could be righteous because (a) we always
live up to expectancy, actual achievement, righteousness in theory. Paul speaks
of it as <i>“a righteousness [that comes] out of [one’s circumstance under]
law” </i>(Romans <b>10</b>:5a; τ<span lang=EL>ὴ</span>ν δικαιοσύνην τ<span
lang=EL>ὴ</span>ν <span lang=EL>ἐ</span>κ το<span lang=EL>ῦ</span> νόμου).
There is only our behavior and the standard for it (Romans <b>10</b>:5b; ο
ποιήσας α<span lang=EL>ὐ</span>τ<span lang=EL>ὰ</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>ἄ</span>νθρωπος ζήσεται <span lang=EL>ἐ</span>ν α<span lang=EL>ὐ</span>το<span
lang=EL>ῖ</span>ς). There is no other “source” of righteousness besides our own
acts—no <u>transfer</u> from someone else’s acts and no someone else <u>regarding</u>
us as what we are not. It is <i>“our own righteousness”</i> (Romans <b>10</b>:3;
τ<span lang=EL>ὴ</span>ν <span lang=EL>ἰ</span>δίαν δικαιοσύνην), not our own <u>standard</u>
of righteousness, but our own righteousness itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            We can be righteous
because (b) other people view us as righteous relative to shared values. That
is practical righteousness, close enough for practical purposes—for friendship purposes,
to grow and strengthen, to accomplish life’s goals. Paul labels this
righteousness “a righteousness of God” (Romans <b>10</b>:3<sup>2</sup>; τ<span
lang=EL>ὴ</span>ν το<span lang=EL>ῦ</span> θεο<span lang=EL>ῦ</span>
δικαισύνην). That righteousness is “of/from” <u>other</u> persons, a
righteousness they regard us as having. They are being <u>gracious</u> to us,
and we <u>trust</u>/believe/have-faith that they are willing to do that. They
do so on <u>conditions</u> (repentance, <i>etc.</i>, which amount to aspects of
identifying with them that we sinned against). We are not <u>causing</u> the
result (relationship) by our own actions relative to the standard (works,
earning, producing, merit, <u>cause</u>). It is a righteousness we “have” by
trusting them to “give” it to us, to regard us as having it (as in <i>“I’ll
give him that”</i>; <u>condition</u>). They reckon it to us, not because of our
overt actions, but because of what they can tell from our overt actions about our
inner self, our heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            A person, especially
a divine person, can read motive, attitude, heart, aspiration, and
intentionality behind overt behavior. The subsequent repentant behavior does
not change the erroneousness/failure/ungoodness of any past act, but it
indicates the difference between the real self and the acting self, the past
behavior and the present aspiration. So, the relationship can continue, being
based on the real self rather than sheer actions; so relationship is more the
point than behavior <i>per se</i>. The shared values of the friendship do not
have to have a one-to-one fit with the performance of the parties in it because
repentance-forgiveness can overlook the difference between performance and
perfection. It can overlook that difference because of the <u>change after our
behavior</u> or because of the <u>difference between our inner and overt self</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            That change from the
former condition by repentance plus forgiveness takes care of cases where the
aspiring self did not come out where the achieving self ought to have arrived. (Romans
<b>7</b>:12ff. is probably not talking about the unconverted person so much as
the converted one who—like all of us—cannot seem to pull off God’s intentions
either.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            (4)  <u>Goodness
relative to morality, wisdom, and ministry</u>. A final aspect of goodness has
to do with the difference between morality, wisdom, and ministry. These three
categories are like concentric circles arranged respectively from small to
large. Duty lines up with morality and ethics, and is based on divine eternal
nature, purpose, and creation. Wisdom is based on the typical nature of things
and deals with what is most likely to work. Ministry goes beyond both areas and
tries to help improve the lot and life of others even when we have no
responsibility for them. When we decide not to do a command about morality, we
sin. When we decide not to take advice in wisdom, we take a risk. When we
decide not to minister, we pass up an opportunity.</p>
