<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Asking whether
something that happened was God’s will, depends on what the question means. There
are two possibilities:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.75in'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>what God causes/what
he makes happen (prescriptive will) and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.75in'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>what he allows to happen
(permissive will).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>What he causes starts with him;
he initiates it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>What he allows starts outside of
him; something/someone else initiates it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>There is also a
difference between <u>supernatural intervention</u> and <u>natural cause</u>. In
the first case, God directly does what occurs; in the second case, he allows
built-in laws to carry things forward; he is working “indirectly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>There is a
difference between <u>God’s supernatural involvement</u> and <u>Satan’s
supernatural involvement</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The comments
below deal with these three distinctions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>God’s Will and Bad
Things That Happen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Since God <u>knows
all things</u> (all-knowing/omniscient) and <u>can do all things</u>—all things
consistent with his nature and purpose (all-powerful/ omnipotent), nothing
happens that he does not know about, and nothing happens that he cannot
prevent. So, everything that does happen—good or bad—is his will, but it is not
always his will in the same sense. This is part of the more basic question, <i>“Why
is there any evil at all in a holy, omnipotent, omniscient God’s universe?”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Job <b>1-2</b> illustrates
the difference between the two meanings of the question about God’s will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>God did not bring the evils on Job; he allowed Satan to bring them on
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>God put <u>limits</u> on the evils Satan could bring on Job. Compare 1
Corinthians <b>10</b>:35: <i>“He will not let you be tempted more than you can
handle.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The evils were not caused or allowed <u>because of some sin</u> Job had
committed. That is what his three friends were trying to make him believe and
admit. But Jesus told his disciples that Pilate’s killing some Galileans during
their sacrificing did not show that they were sinful (<u>moral evil</u>). The
same applied to the ones the tower of Siloam fell on (<u>natural evil</u>). Jesus
also told his disciples that the man born blind was not blind because of some
sin he or his parents had committed (John <b>9</b>:1-3). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The idea that
calamities happen because of some sin is an idea there is no way to verify and
no way to disprove. Since <i>“We have all sinned and fall short of the glory of
God”</i> (Romans <b>3</b>:23), we could always suppose that <u>a</u> misfortune
was because of <u>a</u> sin; we all have many sins. The fact that we cannot
disprove the idea does not make it true, but Jesus’ comments show that the idea
is false. We can agree that there is natural evil, because there was moral
evil; in the beginning, God built limitations and fixed negative consequences
for sin to restrain sin and force us to recognize our dependent position. But
the general rule is that natural calamities (evil) do not come from our moral
evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:-27.0pt'>We can make a
couple additional observations beyond what Job teaches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Doing bad things has bad consequences; that is why we call them bad. But
the bad things are natural consequences of that bad behavior, not something
unrelated like having a storm destroy our crops because we told a lie. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>God may enter the picture in a supernatural way, not just to limit evil
but to punish the evil doer. But his intervention will be clearly a
supernatural intervention, or it could not have its desired effect—punishment
for sin. Supernatural intervention can happen even invisibly to limit evil so
it would not be worse than what his purposes would tolerate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            More basic than whether some bad experience is
God’s will, is why God allows evil at all. There are two general reasons for
allowing it: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>(a) good can come from evil; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            (b) lesser degrees of evil do not frustrate
God’s purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Those points may be elaborated as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Bad experiences provide opportunities to develop virtues and degrees of
virtues that would otherwise not be needed or possible (patience, forgiveness).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Evil reminds us of our dependent position (our insecurity); we are not
in control, which means we are impelled to reach out to him who <u>is</u> in
control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Doing evil results from God’s creating beings with free will. If we were
allowed only to carry out choices among good possibilities, we would not be
good by choice, but by necessity. God would be keeping us from doing anything
wrong by intervening between bad choices and their fulfillment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It avoids the charge that God plays favorites with his own. What would
people suppose if those who love and serve him never got cancer or had rain
ruin their hay? They might try to serve God for selfish reasons. That is one
answer to the question, <i>“Why do good people suffer?”</i> So, evil helps keep
our motives pure for serving God—that <u>our</u> motives are not selfish ones. Satan
tried to use that ploy when he told God, <i>“Does Job serve you for nothing?”</i>
He claimed that if God took away Job’s favored condition, Job would turn away
from him; he would do as Job’s wife suggested, <i>“Curse God and die.”</i> We
serve God anyhow, regardless of <i>“persecution, nakedness, peril, or the
sword”</i> (Romans <b>8</b>:35).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We can see in the bad results of other people’s bad behavior that those
behaviors are, in fact, bad—at least in the long term. That becomes especially
clear when their evil takes aim at us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>(6)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>God allows evil because he is more glorified by our commitment to him,
his will, and his purposes despite serving him to our own disadvantage
(temporary).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'>Along with trying to read God’s will in given experiences, is the
distinction between supernatural intervention (direct operation) and natural
cause (indirect operation). Some pagan cultures suppose direct operation in all
actions. The stone rolls down the hill because god (a god) made it roll down
the hill (occasionalism) or because the stone decided to roll down the hill
(animism). In the last case, all things that act are thought of as being like
us—as having a will to act, as being “personal” in that way.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:40.5pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:40.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>NOTE: We
distinguish between <u>things</u> (impersonal) and <u>persons</u> (personal). Among
things, we include chemical processes (<u>inorganic</u>) and most <u>organic</u>
(plants and animal) forms. Animals and humans are considered distinct even
though some “higher animals” exhibit rudimentary choice and degrees of thought,
transcendence, and creativity. Some animals seem to live in some ways above a
sheer stimulus-response existence. Some people seem to exhibit a mere
stimulus-response existence; they simply respond to the strongest physical,
social, or psychological stimulus!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify'>            Finally,
do we interpret an evil experience as being from God as punishment or from
Satan as persecution? That relates to the more fundamental question of whether
it needs to be interpreted as caused supernaturally either by God or Satan. Unless
there is a reason to think otherwise, we should probably suppose it is <u>caused
naturally</u> by built-in natural law or unprevented natural choice to sin
against us. Supposing God’s indirect operation makes it easier to deal with the
problem of evil, especially with extreme evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:center'>God’s
Will and Divine Guidance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify'>            One
further thought about reading God’s will. Sometimes it is not a matter of figuring
out why something bad has happened. We suggest that we not read occurrences as
signs unless there is some reason to do so; <u>we do not consider it a sign if we
cannot tell the difference</u>. If we can read what happens in more than one
way, we do not take it as a sign about either way. God is not going to hold us
responsible for something that is not clear; if he wants to make a point of
something we have missed, he will see that things happen more clearly later. Besides,
we do not have to know that he is guiding us; we just need to make sensible
choices from what happens. And we need not God wants us to do one specific
thing; many good things fit within his intentions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-4.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'>In addition, we do well not to read providence for each other; it is
better to let people interpret providence for themselves. If we cannot tell the
difference between natural and supernatural cause, we should not suppose that
God is trying to tell us something. What is happening is part of the way God set
up the world to run. We must decide for ourselves whether resistance to our
good intentions means we should try harder (to conquer the opposition) or back
off and let what happens guide our next choices.</p>
