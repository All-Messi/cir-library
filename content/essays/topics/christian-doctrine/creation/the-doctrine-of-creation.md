The doctrine of creation is unique to the Judaeo-Christian and Islamic heritages.


I. Biblical Materials


A.	Genesis <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:1; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:4; Isaiah<strong> 45</strong>:18; note other statements about “made” heaven and

earth (Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:15; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:24-25; Exodus <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:11; Psalm<strong> 146</strong>:6; Hebrews <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:2;

Revelation<strong> 14</strong>:7; 1 Peter <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:5)

B.	John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:1-3: <em>“All things were made through him, and without him nothing was </em>

<em>			made that was made.”</em>

C.	Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:15-17: <em>“In [the Firstborn] all things were created in the heavens </em>

<em>			and on the earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, dominions, first causes, </em>

<em>			or powers. All things have been created through him and to him.”</em>

D.	Hebrews<strong> 11</strong>:1-3: <em>“Through [the Son] [God] made the worlds.”</em>


II. Alternatives to Creation from Nothing


A.	Eternality of matter


1.  	Big bang plus collapse into black holes plus another big bang (the “pulsating

universe”)

2.  	Entropy plus “anti-entropy” as ongoing principles in tension


B.	God’s creating the material universe out of himself

C.	Emanationism: the physical realm is to God like a ray from the sun


III. The Scope of Creation (presumably all that is not God)


A.  People

B.	Angels


1.	The word <em>angels</em> refers to


a.	Messengers in general (Luke <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:24; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:52; James<strong> 2</strong>:25)

b.	Supernatural spiritual beings, messengers of God (Matthew <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:20, <em>etc</em>.)


(1)	Guardian angels (Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:10; Acts <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:15?)

(2)	Good angels: Gabriel (Luke<strong> 1</strong>:19); Michael (Jude 9)

(3)	Bad angels = demons (2 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:4; Jude 6)


c.	Evangelists (? Revelation <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:1, 8; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:10?; <em>etc</em>.)

d.	Spirit of a dead person (Acts <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:15?)

e.	Angel of the Lord = deity in Judges <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:19-24: <em>“And the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. And Gideon saw that he was the angel of the Lord. And Gideon said, ‘Alas, O Lord Jehovah, for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.’”</em>


2.	That angels are created beings seems clear from Psalm <strong><u><sup>148</sup></u></strong>:2 + 5 (cp. 2 Kings

<strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:3; Jeremiah <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>:22; Daniel <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:10; Zephaniah <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:5) and Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:16

3.	Satan (2 Corinthians<strong> 11</strong>:14)


C.  Impersonal/material universe


IV. Creation and the Principle That <em>“From nothing nothing comes”</em> (<em>nihil ex nihilo</em>)
