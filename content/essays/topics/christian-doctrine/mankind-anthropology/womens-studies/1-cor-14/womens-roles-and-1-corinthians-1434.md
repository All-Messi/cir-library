<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Relevant contrasts</u>. The statements
in 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34 appear in a context that contrasts “not speaking”
with insubordination and causing confusion. Earlier in 1 Corinthians Paul talks
about women praying and prophesying (<b>11</b>:2-16). Evidently Paul’s meaning
in the expression “be silent” is in contrast to speaking in such a way that
creates disorder and implies a rebellious spirit. The English word “quiet” may
be a closer synonym to the term in the original language, because <i>“quiet”</i>
does not necessarily mean absolutely silent so much as verbally and
behaviorally restrained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>The Spirit’s subjection to the prophet</u>.
Subjection is not bad. One fundamental problem in women’s studies generally is
the assumption that being subordinate means being less valuable, especially if
the subordinate person has no possibility of being other than subordinate. It
is the assumption that there is no reason for being “second in command” except
being less capable. But in 1 Corinthians, even the Holy Spirit is said to be
subject, not to the Father and the Son in this case, but to the prophet. Subjection
simply means relating appropriately to another person who has final
responsibility for the work of the group and has been given authority for
fulfilling that responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Comparison to church meals</u>. A
reader wonders whether the force of 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34 may compare with
that of 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:22. The latter text is not forbidding
Christians to eat together; it is saying that if they are going to use eating
together as a time to cause division, to be insensitive, and to put each other
down, then they should eat at home. That is a different thing from forbidding
common meals as such. The prohibition is in terms of an assumed set of
inappropriate conditions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Likewise, Paul may not be prohibiting
women from prophesying when he says they should be “silent.” He may mean that
if they are going to prophesy in a way that causes disorder and communicates lack
of deference, then they need to be quiet. (This suggestion works even if we
assume that “silent” means not speaking.) It is something he says first to men <u>and</u>
women alike as a more general principle (<b>14</b>:26-33a); then he applies it
to women as especially appropriate, because they are to “keep their place” in
relation to their husbands. The reason against <u>confusion</u> applies to men
and women indiscriminately (26-33a); the additional reason against <u>insubordination</u>
applies to women. It is particularly embarrassing (“shameful”) for women to
behave “stridently” in public. Doing so is not only inappropriate because it
produces disorder, but because it lets out an embarrassing family secret: <i>“This
lady does not respect her husband at home or she would not feel free to act
this way in front of him in public.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is perhaps expected that the relatively
greater freedom and ennoblement of women in the church <i>vs</i>. the synagogue
or even Greek culture could lead to excesses in the case of some who want to
push things too far because of their own propensity to seek control or get
attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The reader may note the following elements
of similarity between agape feasts and women’s prophesying. (a) There is a
similarity between <i>“when you come together”</i> (<b>14</b>:26 + <b>11</b>:20)
and <i>“in church”</i> (<b>14</b>:35, 28, 33? + <b>11</b>:22). (b) There are
also the similar expressions <i>“What, don’t you have houses to eat in?”</i> (<b>11</b>:22)
and <i>“What, was it from you that the word of God went forth or came to you?” </i>(<b>14</b>:36).
This contrasts with <b>14</b>:33b: <i>“as in all the churches.”</i> The effect
can be put this way: <i>“Do you think you are an exception to the rule that
applies everywhere else? Did you originate the expectancies and set the
pattern? Are you the only ones that have to do with the gospel?”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>The meaning of </u></span><u><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>λαλέω</span></u><u><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></u><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(laleō)</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The meaning of </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>λαλέω</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<i>laleō</i>, <i>“to speak”</i>) must be more
specific than merely saying something. (a) <i>“The woman could ask her husband
at home” </i>may suggest <i>“speaking”</i> in the sense of <i>“badgering.”</i> (b)
The comment about <i>“the S/spirit of the prophet being subject to the prophet”</i>
may imply <i>“speaking”</i> as <u>emotionally driven verbalization</u>, driven
in a way that it interrupts (<b>14</b>:27-29) or harangues—gets started and
does not stop. (<i>“If a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the
first one become silent,”</i> <b>14</b>:30.) Women’s generally greater
verbalization skills together with their tendency toward greater emotional
involvement make this result more natural for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>No localized instruction</u>. The
directives Paul gives regarding public relational behavior between men and
women (veil-wearing, praying and prophesying, asking questions) are not
localized to Corinth. He goes out of his way to stress the fact that the
Corinthians are not special (<b>14</b>:36), and he is not treating them any
differently than he treats the other churches (<b>14</b>:33b; <b>11</b>:16,
2-3; cp. Titus <b>1</b>:5).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>“Custom” of veil-wearing</u>. Paul
calls veil-wearing a “custom,” which could contrast with “commandments” of the
Lord. There are two levels to the veil-wearing issue: (a) the principle of
female deference in general and (b) veil-wearing as an indication of that deference
specifically (<b>11</b>:10). “Custom” could be broad enough to include both
levels (Acts <b>6</b>:14 speaks of <i>“the</i> </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἔθνη</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> [<i>ethnē</i>,
<i>customs</i>] <i>of Moses”</i>; cp. </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>συνήθεια</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>[<i>synētheia</i>] in 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:16). Under
appropriate conditions <u>veil-wearing</u> could be dispensed with inasmuch as
it is not an inherently necessary way of expressing deference. (Eve presumably
wore no veil even after the expulsion from the garden.) But the <u>deference</u>
issue is based on first principles: (1) the sequence of creating Adam and Eve
(1 Timothy <b>2</b>:13); (2) the order and manner of their falling into sin (1
Timothy <b>2</b>:14); and (3) the analogy between man-woman order and
God-Christ order (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:3;<b> 15</b>:26-28; Romans <b>5</b>:19;
Philippians<b> 2</b>:8), Christ-church order (Ephesians<b> 5</b>:23, 29), and
Christ-man order (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:3).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Whether veil-wearing was or was not a
custom of the church as such (<i>vs</i>. a cultural practice not discarded by
the church) is unclear in 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:16: <i>“We have no such
custom”</i> could mean no custom of not wearing the veil, or it could mean no
custom of wearing the veil. In the second case, Paul’s point would be, <i>“If a
person wants to make a fuss about wearing a veil, do not push the matter to the
point of creating division over it; it is not a church matter </i>per se<i>.”</i>
The other way the point would be that the contentious person should know that
Paul and other churches are in agreement with the veil-wearing policy. The
contender cannot suppose that this is a special restriction placed on the
Corinthian church. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Home and church</u>. We wonder also how
the fact that churches usually met in homes affected the close connection
between family structure and church structure. The man-woman role relationship
at home would foster appropriate behavior “in church” because churches often met
in homes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The comparison between church and home
behavior is natural additionally, however, because they must be compatible for
practical purposes (<b>14</b>:33-35). Both home and church deal with the full
range of life issues and the same people. There cannot be one structure at home
and the reverse of it at church: husbands as responsible heads of the home, but
wives as heads of the church. The functioning of the home and of the church
deal with many of the same issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some adjustments to this generality may
have come up in the cases of virgins and widows. They would not be operating in
relation to husbands at home. (We would assume that virgins would operate in
relation to fathers normally.) Widows enrolled in the care of the church may
have been given certain responsibilities in return for the support they
received.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>“Prophesy” <i>vs.</i> “teach.”</u> In 1
Corinthians <b>14</b> and <b>11</b> the subject is prophesying and praying, not
teaching, which is the subject in 1 Timothy<b> 2</b>. No woman is ever said to have
taught in the first-century church (except in an unofficial sense as in Titus <b>2</b>:3-5;
cp. 2 Timothy<b> 1</b>:5 + <b>3</b>:14-15), although women did <i>“prophesy” </i>(1
Corinthians <b>14</b>:26-36; <b>11</b>:2-16; Acts <b>21</b>:9; <b>2</b>:18 &lt;
Joel <b>2</b>:28; cp. <b>18</b>:26?). The inference seems to be that “teaching”
referred to the role associated with elder-bishop-pastor-teacher-ruler. The
thing Paul does not allow in 1 Timothy <b>2 </b>is the eldership role, and
therefore with exercising “dominion”—responsibility reinforced by authority
(cp. the creation account where God gave mankind dominion over the earth). “Teaching”
in this case connotes official teaching—teaching in an official capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Culture</u>. A cultural element may
enter in here because the connotation of “teacher” may have been informed by
rabbinic backgrounds as well as the philosophical tradition among the Greeks. Today
in the western world, we probably do not associate authority with teaching so
readily as people did in ancient Jewish culture particularly. To a certain
extent culture is involved in the way we view teaching, but it is doubtful that
culture has the same prominence in this matter as it does in veil-wearing,
footwashing, the holy kiss, and even slavery perhaps.</span></p>
