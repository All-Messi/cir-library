complicate any endeavor, including the interaction between men and women in the
home, the church, and society. An unnecessary “edge” gets into discussions on this
matter because of unconscious preconceptions about (a) the bases for
self-esteem, (b) the nature of leaders and led and their interaction, and (c)
the impact that love has on all interpersonal processes formal or natural.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Prolegomena”
refers to ideas already in place before approaching a subject. They include
what Paul references in Colossians <b>2</b>:8, 28 as <i>“rudiments of the world</i>,<i>”</i>
which probably refers to the all-pervasive notion of ontic dualism among
Gentiles together with spin-offs like secret knowledge, “salvation,” and
behavioral implications. In Galatians <b>4</b>:3, 9, the expression evidently
highlights the Judaizers’ belief that Paul is countering: the permanence of
Mosaism and the placement of Messianism within it. In our own day, biological general
evolution provides the starting point for scientific understanding. Viewpoints
that counter that assumption create about the same response as Paul’s reference
to resurrection did after his Areopagus speech (Acts <b>17</b>:32). Until prolegomena
get identified, addressed, and resolved, not much progress occurs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Prolegomena
are what “everybody” already thinks, so examining them does not happen. The
situation becomes more difficult when people are not even aware of their
assumptions. Attempts to investigate subsequent matters foment resentment,
frustration, exaggeration, misrepresentation, even anger and division because advocates
of opposing viewpoints do not make sense to each other. The disputants may suppose
that the other positions must come from inappropriate motives, sheer ignorance,
baseless emotion, arrogance, and the like. There is little interest in
re-examining the subject because no conceivable reason exists for an alternate belief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Figuring
Self-Esteem</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            </span></b><u><span

115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> </span></b><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>People’s sense of
worth informs their attitudes and behavior toward other people. The conviction in
this topic is that people typically base their self-esteem on success in
competition with <u>other people</u>, on being “better than”: knowing more
than, being smarter than, more athletic than, stronger than, better looking
than, more famous than, of higher rank than, more successful than . . ., and
they do not even realize they are doing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
shows itself in behaviors like trying to “take charge,” striving for the
highest place in the “pecking order,” having to be the center of attention,
insisting on some viewpoint they want to promote. It explains bullying, abusive
behavior, mean-spiritedness, snobbishness, and practically every negative
behavior from interactions between individuals to relations between nations.
People are unwilling to listen because, by changing their minds, they admit
their opponent is “better than.” Competition as a basis for self-esteem
exhibits the self-centeredness and selfishness that contrast to self-giving for
the joy of others, that is, what love in the Golden Rule represents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
whole competition endeavor is doomed because it works only for a minority since
being best leaves out the majority. Besides, the ones presently better will
lose status by aging. The style of living leads to a literal dead end.
Additionally, it creates the adverse effect by fomenting division with other
people who are apt to be operating in the same self-defeating manner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Instead
of competition with other people outside the self (<u>pride</u>), <u>self-esteem</u>
comes from factors within the self, that is, (a) between responsibility
assigned to “me” and fulfillment achieved by “me.” It comes also from (b) being
loved by other people, especially by those whom “I” have first loved and
experience the “love echo” from. (c) Helping other people brings its own satisfaction
and fulfillment. It is part of the outward-directed life, which replaces the
self-centeredness that competition expresses. That all derives from (d) being
created in the image of God, which centers around the interpersonal capacity
summed up in love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
construction brings in a sliding-scale basis for self-esteem that eliminates
differences in ability, personality, opportunity, environment, available help,
and other factors beyond a person’s control. “Career” does not take precedence
over family roles. The importance of providing and protecting does not get
compared with nurturing. Who can even say which is the more important necessity
in the whole? Everyone ends up fair and equal in their sense of worth; and even
if they are not equally significant objectively, it does not matter to them
subjectively. Neither jealousy nor pride arise. Egalitarianism and
equalitarianism are too simplistic to provide the final word in figuring
personal worth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Leadership
and Cooperation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>The
Second Prolegomenon</u>. Too often, leadership is thought of in terms of
authority, rank, power. That displaces attention onto controlling other people
and slides back into competition behavior. It implies “putdown” to those not in
charge, which grates against the self-esteem they naturally crave as well. A <i>National
Geographic</i> issue illustrates the point by choosing “dominance” for
household headship (April 2023, pp. 15-18) under patriarchy. That implies
“submissiveness” as its correlate, together with its negative connotation. It
suggests that if you are not in charge or do not have the opportunity to be in
charge, you are not worth as much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            So,
the second prolegomenon requires a corrected understanding of leading. <u>Leadership</u>
is responsibility, not rank and control; authority only reinforces assigned
responsibility for other people’s awareness. No responsibility, no authority,
and nobody “in charge.” The proper perspective puts emphasis on accomplishing
purpose. Being head is not a perk; it is an onus. It is not for stroking ego,
but for getting the job done.  “Servant leader” becomes the descriptor: servant
to the goal and leader in responsibility for achieving it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Those
who work alongside the one held responsible show respect by acknowledging the
other’s responsibility. As leadership fulfills responsibility; <u>deference</u>
expresses cooperation. The two aspects are defined together and operate in
complementary fashion. So, the rest of the group does<span style='color:red'> </span>not
stand in the way, challenge, argue with, clamor for their preferences, threaten
to quit, try to overthrow, or “be difficult.” Suggestions are welcome, on the
one hand, and willingness to listen exists, on the other hand. Truth is, the
one leading does not always know what is best. Assigned responsibility avoids
competition to establish dominance and the negatives that come with it. The “head”
realizes that lasting success depends on influence anyway, regardless of what
authority his “office” possesses. Without influence, authority will not
accomplish much. As a practical fact anyway, most of what gets done in a
healthy group occurs without much conscious appeal to authority flow. Some kind
of division of labor evolves, the full range of activities gets covered, and a
sense of freedom is “had by all.” Complementarianism describes the
circumstance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            What
happens in a family or church compares with how a college faculty operates in a
university. A department head and the faculty members do not proceed on the
assumption that the department head is the smartest, most educated, the best
teacher, the one with the most seniority, the one that tells and does not
listen. Everyone understands that the role calls for establishing a<span
style='color:red'> </span>line schedule, choosing class offerings, assigning
classes to various professors, and so on so everything gets covered. For that
to succeed, the department head confers with professors about courses, time<span
style='color:black'> of day</span>, what days, and the like. After all, the
department head answers to a higher rank for the department’s quality of
education. Otherwise, morale weakens, and efficiency and quality wane. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So,
it is to everyone’s benefit to prioritize interpersonal factors. As in a
college, so in a family and church. Not being leader is not a putdown, and
being leader is not a perk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Love Context</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Third Prolegomenon</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>. We have already referenced Jesus’ presentation
about love in the form of the Golden Rule. To understand and appreciate parts
and their interaction, we need to see the complete picture. Since love is most
basic to all positive social interaction, it is likewise most basic to marriage
and family function. The nature of the whole and the arrangement of its parts have
a qualifying effect on how they work together. The diagram below combines the functioning
of “Men and Women in Christ.” Although love sets the nature of all
interpersonal operations, it does not always receive the attention it deserves
in our topic. Besides getting rid of abuses that Peter and Paul warn against in
their household teachings, love is the great equalizer, so competition does not
reign, and sameness does not become the ideal. Love avoids exaggeration of
difference, denial of relative gifting, and any division of labor that may stem
from them. Love can allow for variance in applying the system and bail out some
misunderstanding. This diagram pictures the situation, and then the subsequent
observations wrap up the discussion.</span></p>

Second Great Commandment (Matthew <b>23</b>:39-40) and Royal Law (James <b>2</b>:8)
as recast in the Golden Rule (Matthew <b>7</b>:12) set the context for family,
church, and all social operations. The Golden Rule calls for looking at the
situation through the eyes of the other, not just (1) for following some rule
we think the scripture teaches or (b) for doing what <u>we</u> want done to us;
there is someone <u>else</u> involved here. It calls for projecting
consciousness over behind the eyes of the other so we can go beyond the way we
want to be treated, period, to the way we want to be treated in that person’s different
circumstance. That is a valuable point between men and women, and between
leaders and led simultaneously. Moreover, love finds demonstration in the life
of our Lord himself relative to his church. We are obliged to do no less with
each other than he does with us. Without love, no pattern of organization
eliminates the negatives that can creep into Christian living. </span></p>
