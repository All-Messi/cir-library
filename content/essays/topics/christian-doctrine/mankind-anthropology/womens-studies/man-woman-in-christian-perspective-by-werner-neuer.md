begins by placing the relevance of his topic in the contemporary challenge of
secular feminism, an important point because the church, in being biblical,
should not be needlessly countercultural. Subsequent chapters on male-female
differences reflect the natural assumption that in the family and in the church
God has assigned role emphases correlated with sex in keeping with the way he
has gifted males and females. Five chapters deal with the view of man and woman
found in the Old Testament, the gospels, the epistles of Paul, the rest of the
New Testament, and in church history. Two chapters address the continuing
validity of the biblical viewpoint and the urgency of practicing it. The volume
concludes with a summary of main points. Along the way, five <i>excursi</i>
expand on texts and issues that call for more extended treatment than the
ongoing presentation itself allows.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                                                                            <u>Man
and Woman . . .</u> exhibits a fine spirit, avoiding the extremes and false
issues that continually plague studies on this subject. Neuer covers all the
important passages on male-female relations in the home and in the church. In
women’s ministry he correctly identifies the issue as the ministry of the word
in an authoritative sense, that is, what the free-church tradition associates
with eldership or its equivalent. Other areas of service for women are not at
issue. He does a good job of showing that interpersonal theory stated in
Galatians <b>3</b>:28 does not eliminate hierarchical structuring for practical
purposes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                                                                            The
wide-ranging scholarship does not come off “heavy” even in translation. The
study integrates insights from sociology, psychology, and physiology with its
theological-biblical treatment because all these disciplines bear on the
contemporary discussion. His analysis of the cause for the feminist extreme is
particularly well-taken: <i>“At bottom feminism is the consistent unloving
answer to men’s lack of love”</i> (p. 106). The book is well-indexed by
scripture and topic and nicely documented with endnotes. The bibliography is
extensive, predominantly German (over 80%). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                                                                            One
line of thought in evangelical feminism could be responded to more
deliberately. Readers need to hear adequate responses to the plausible-sounding
comparison current writers are making between the way the New Testament argues
for female deference in the home and in ministry, on the one hand, and the way
it argues for observing cultural practices like veil-wearing and hair styles or
the way it deals with slavery. Presentations favoring a more traditional view
of women’s roles can seem convincing considered by themselves. But people get
confused when these other issues come in as control cases to test the validity
of the argument pattern for male-female order (parity of reason). The false
comparison misleads believers into agreeing that female deference must have
been another first-century cultural issue like dress code and slavery. Although
the book speaks to the matter (pp. 113-14, <i>e.g</i>.), it could be more
compelling in the way it treats the parallel with veil-wearing. It apparently
does not address the parallel with slavery at all. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                                                                            One
case of apparent “over interpretation” appears in Neuer’s otherwise helpful
treatment of Genesis <b>3</b>. In agreement with other male and female writers
cited, he understands Eve’s involvement in the fall as a lack of deference—a
taking over of leadership from Adam (pp. 75-78). The approach seems to betray a
common confusion between influence and authority. <u>Leadership</u> has to do
with responsibility, hence, authority to help fulfill responsibility;
consequently, <u>deference</u> has to do with respecting that responsibility. But
respecting authority does not remove the propriety of shedding influence. In
fact, good leadership <u>should</u> listen to those being led. The first
problem with Adam was not abdication of leadership responsibility but yielding
to temptation (note 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:14a). <u>Eve’s act</u> was sinful
because she shed bad influence (albeit while deceived), not because she was
insubordinate. Otherwise, a woman would not be free to think for herself on
religious issues, which she must do to fulfill responsibility for herself. <u>Adam’s
act</u> was sinful because he yielded to temptation <u>and</u> because he
failed to fulfill responsibility in the process. Whenever a leader sins, he
does two things: he sins <u>and</u> misleads. One would not expect Neuer to
take the position he does on Genesis <b>3</b> since elsewhere he seems to
identify leadership as responsibility reinforced by authority (pp. 112-29); so submission
would be acting in ways appropriate to the recognition of another’s
responsibility. Influence (<i>vs</i>. authority) would harmonize with that
recognition.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                                                                            Neuer
speaks of the ministry in “priesthood” terms, which may weaken his position for
Christians that do not see ordination as a validation of ministry or conceive
of ministers as priests. One wonders what adjustment he would make if he were
operating in a non-clerical, free-church approach to “the ministry of the word.”
These features of the presentation, however, do not change the assessment that <i>Man
&amp; Woman in Christian Perspective</i> does a commendable job of dealing with
the diverse elements of the current women’s studies debate within the church. </span></p>
