style='font-size:12.0pt'>Introductory Observations</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> In general, women’s studies relate to the <u>genetic
nature</u> of men and women and <u>cultural expectancy</u> regarding their
interaction. Discussing evangelical perspectives on men and women in
relationship adds <u>biblical interpretation</u> to the inquiry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> On this subject what makes a viewpoint evangelical is
not so much the viewpoint itself as the accompanying attitude toward scripture
and the consequent method of interpretation which that attitude involves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> The <u>same viewpoint</u> may be shared by those with
different views of scripture. An egalitarian viewpoint may be taken by a
neo-orthodox or modernist/liberal who sees New Testament writers as products of
their own time; a complementarian may arrive at that same point hermeneutically
while affirming the inerrancy of scripture. <u>Different viewpoints</u> may be
taken by those with the same view of scripture because they differ in their
approach to interpretation. That last phenomenon establishes the subject matter
for this presentation. In short, as a matter of description, within
evangelicalism stands both (1) egalitarianism/ equalitarianism and (2)
complementarianism/hierarchism, hence, the title “Evangelical Perspective<u>s</u>.”
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Egalitarianism” means either that there
is no organizational structure in home (or church) or that all places of
responsibility are equally open to men and women “on a level playing field.” “Complementarianism”
means that there is a pattern that enjoins men to accept the ultimate places of
responsibility—at least as a matter of wisdom if not standard norm. Ideally
both approaches stand within an original interpersonal condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> NOTE: Labels are often more confusing than helpful,
but for present purposes four terms correlate with the following distinctions. In
part, evangelicalism may be distinguished from neo-orthodoxy and
modernism/liberalism to the left and fundamentalism to the right by
hermeneutics and by their variant understandings of the nature of scripture. <u>Fundamentalism</u>
tends toward a legal conceptualization of biblical content, which shows up in
more rigid thinking patterns and absolute viewpoints, in stressing literalism
over anything else as the assumed intention of biblical statements, and in
being less amenable to cultural qualification of biblical statements; it
produces concepts like the husband/father as priest of the wife and the family.
<u>Evangelicalism</u> emphasizes special divine guidance in the origination of
scripture whereas <u>neo-orthodoxy</u> emphasizes the guidance of the Spirit on
the reader’s response as comparable to that in the writer’s communication (as
each writer interprets “events” vs. receives “words” that constitute
revelation). <u>Modernism/liberalism</u> pretty well dissociates special divine
assistance from either end of the revelation-illumination process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

concept inventory co-extensive with the speaker’s. Otherwise conceptual
match-up will not always occur between reader and writer.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The interpersonal worldview</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Interpersonal relationship is the basic, central,
ultimate, most important reality in the Christian understanding of the big
picture. That belief has qualifying effects on subsequent considerations. Since
<u>love</u> is the summarizing reality for positive interpersonal
relationships, its attitude and pattern of operation must be maintained in all
subsequent operations. As a result, legal and natural processes between persons
are limited in their manner and scope of functioning by the larger
interpersonal construct in which they stand. (See documents “Bases for
Interpersonalism” and “Characteristics of Interpersonalism” found in the
author’s unpublished packet of essays entitled <u>Interpersonalism: The
Integrating Reality for Christian Truth</u>.)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Imperatival intent</span></u><span style='font-size:

exhortation, and entreaty. (See document entitled “Imperatival Intent.”)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Morality (ethics/”law”/mandate), wisdom, and service</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. These three types of social-relationship categories
are concentric spheres expanding from morality to wisdom to service. Is the
imperative form in a given text used as a mandate (“law”), which someone <u>sins</u>
against if he does not follow; or is that imperative meant as advice (wisdom)
for practical purposes, so that a person <u>takes a risk</u> if he does not
follow it?</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Responsibility more than authority</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The real issue is where God has placed final <u>responsibility</u>
in home and church (and, presumably, by implication society in general). Authority
comes into the picture simply as a function of responsibility. The biblical
terminology “headship” and “submission” are correlative concepts: “headship”
simply means who God holds ultimately responsible for the successful operation
of home and church; “submission” simply means conducting oneself toward the
“head” in a way which recognizes that he has that ultimate responsibility to
fulfill. The very terms themselves conjure up negatives in the minds of a
highly individualistic culture. Understanding that the real issue is
responsibility should help remove an unnecessary stigma from expressions like
“authority,” “headship,” and “submission.” </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Standard situation</span></u><span style='font-size:

women assume a circumstance of “married with children.”</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Disjunction of rank and worth</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. A child is not worth less than an adult simply
because she is a child. A person with a lower IQ is not worth less than a
genius, a highly coordinated athlete than a “clumsy” individual, someone with
perfect pitch than another who is tone deaf. They may be more “useful” to
certain endeavors than their less gifted counterparts, but they are not less
“worthful.”</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Shifting from success in competition as a basis for
personal worth</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> and replacing it with
(a) being created in the image of God, (b) living in positive vertical and
horizontal relationships, and (c) self-giving in service relative to divine
purpose. This reconceptualization involves a change from works to grace-trust
and from competition to love as objective foundations for self-worth.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>Control cases</u>: slavery, veil-wearing, holy
kiss, homosexuality, superspirituality, silence behavior, parenting, etc. Here
also belongs “exceptions to the rule.” Exceptions are important because they
make clear that the rule is in fact a rule rather than a uniformity and that
there is a higher frame of reference that is more important and more
fundamental than the rule itself; otherwise the exception could not exist
without contradiction.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>   <u>Assumed limitation</u>, cultural and otherwise. By
the nature of language communication, authorial intent determines the meaning
of statements; so readers have to consider whether a writer’s statement in
absolute form has an intended meaning within an assumed frame of reference.</span></p>

manner of male-female natural differentiation. Obviously men and women are not
opposites nor skilled in entirely different ways. In fact, they are not
necessarily differentiated at all in many respects. Theirs are relative
strengths in some areas. The only question then is whether scripture indicates
that God has gifted men and women differently in correlation with differing
centers of responsibility that by nature and purpose (and conceivably positive
directives) he has willed them to have.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>Perversion of something as distinguished from the
character of the thing itself</u>. Perversion of authority is not an
appropriate basis in itself for eliminating responsible authority anymore than
perversion of political process is a justification for anarchism. Furthermore,
as surely as something good can be perverted, something bad can be ameliorated
by interpersonal qualifications. The latter is what Christians typically assume
apostolic writers are doing with slavery inasmuch as early Christians had no
power to eliminate the institution itself. The question is whether those
writers were doing that same thing in giving directives about male-female
relationship. Obviously first-century Christians could ill afford to
characterize themselves as social subversives on unnecessary points. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                             A related consideration
here is the tendency in some of the general literature today to feature
“dominance” and “subjugation” as the issue in “patriarchy”; unconsciously that
sense of the topic can bend biblical texts into advocating a practice foreign to
the writers’ intent. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>Better does not constitute best</u>. <u>Equality</u>
of individuals may be better than oppression of certain classes of them but <u>unity</u>
is the higher good in men-women relationship. The political system may indeed
be able only to establish equality (and eliminate abuse), but worldview (i.e.,
“religion”) has to be left free to inculcate the summum bonum. What may be
achieved by law may be less than what people would best aspire to in marriage,
home, and church. Consequently, the political realm ought not interfere with the
“religious” one.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>A wide range of interpretation principles</u>. Particularly
common is the tendency to adopt a conclusion and then work toward it rather
than operate, so to speak, from behind “a veil of ignorance” regarding the
proper conclusion. The more appropriate hermeneutical method is to establish
clear primary frameworks (like interpersonalism) and read ambiguous specifics
in light of clear fundamentals.</span></p>
