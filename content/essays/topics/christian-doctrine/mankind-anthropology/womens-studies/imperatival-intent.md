<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Imperative forms can convey a range of
meanings; they have <b>(1)</b> <b>varied quality</b>. In language, authorial
intent does not bear a one-to-one relationship with linguistic forms. In
assessing a writer’s use of the imperative mood, we look beyond the form itself
and infer its force from the near and distant <u>literary context</u>, the <u>historical
context</u>, and <u>the nature of the case</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (a) Imperatives may <u>entreat</u>, where one
wants a benefit.       </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (b) Imperatives may <u>advise</u>, where
for purposes of communication the speaker treats the hearers as a personal
equals. If they do not take the advice, they run a <u>risk</u>, because advice
is rooted simply in the <u>nature of the case</u>.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (c)  Imperatives may <u>exhort</u>. Entreaty
does not impact women’s studies, and exhortation is an extension of advice and
commandment. Imperatival intent in women’s studies addresses the distinction
between advice and commandment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (d) Imperatives may <u>mandate</u>. If people
do not do a command, they <u>disobey</u>, because mandates are rooted in the <u>authority
of the speaker</u>, not just in the nature of the case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Entreaties, advice, mandates, and
exhortations involve imperatives used within an <b>(2) </b><b>assumed
limitation</b>. The implied limitation may consist of the <u>intended topic</u>.
Here the danger is that a reader may apply the command to matters beyond the
author’s frame of reference (cp. essay on “Notations on 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:11-12”).
The implied limitation may consist of some <u>assumed condition</u> in the
setting—in the person, the congregation, or the culture. <i>“[If this is the
way you are going to act at agape feasts], eat at home”</i> (cp. 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:22).
The frame of reference may consist of some <u>overriding purpose</u> beyond the
directive. <i>“[Even though slavery is not an appropriate condition to force
another person into,] slaves, submit yourselves to your masters so God’s name
will not be blasphemed”</i> (1 Timothy<b> 6</b>:1; cp. Ephesians <b>6</b>:5-8;
Colossians <b>3</b>:22-25; Titus<b> 1</b>:9-10; 1 Peter <b>2</b>:18-25). <i>“[If
this is what it means to other people], don’t eat shamble meat; [you may
communicate the wrong thing and thereby confuse a disbeliever or tempt a weaker
brother”]</i> (1 Corinthians <b>8</b>; <b>10</b>:23-<b>11</b>:1; contrast Acts<b>
15</b>:19-21, 28-29). <i>“[Lest you bring disrepute on the fledgling Christian
community,] do not take another Christian to court for cheating you”</i> (cp. 1
Corinthians<b> 6</b>:1-7). The implied limitation may consist of a <u>standard
situation</u>. <i>“An elder should have faithful children” </i>(1 Timothy<b> 3</b>:4-5,
12; Titus<b> 1</b>:6). The implied limitation may consist of a <u>significant
generality</u> with understood exceptions. <i>“Submit to every human ordinance
for the Lord’s sake”</i> (1 Peter<b> 2</b>:13; contrast Acts <b>4</b>:16-20; <b>5</b>:29).
Aside from those topics, conditions, purposes, situations, or generalities, the
imperatives may not apply. Legitimately applying imperatives beyond their original
frame of reference requires proper generalization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Implied limitation corresponds with <b>(3)</b>
<b>intended audience</b>. An imperative may address God’s people in any age,
but it may also belong only to people in one <u>dispensation</u>: <i>“Bring the
whole tithe into the store house”</i> (Malachi<b> 3</b>:10). Imperatives may
pertain only to people in the <u>contemporary culture</u>:<i> “Salute each
other with a holy kiss” </i>(Romans 1<b>6</b>:16;        1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:20;
2 Corinthians <b>13</b>:12; 1 Thessalonians<b> 5</b>:26; 1 Peter<b> 5</b>:14). Imperatives
may pertain only to people in an <u>assumed special setting</u>: <i>“Don’t look
for a wife [while ministering in this time of duress]” </i>(1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:27). 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Our practical response to biblical
imperatives depends on the <u>author’s intent</u>, the <u>assumed setting</u>,
and the <u>audience addressed</u>. Imperatives do not apply in every sense or
circumstance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            These observations have a bearing on
reading New Testament imperatives about female behavior. When we read an
imperative verb about women, we do not automatically take it as an <u>absolute
mandate addressed to us</u>. We consider both the quality of the imperative and
its frame of reference before we decide what we should do. The question is not
the reliability and authority of scripture but its meaning and relevance. As
not every example is a precedent, so not every command is a mandate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             To illustrate the qualifying impact of
imperatival intent, we offer an example from everyday life. It is about an hour
before dinner, and Mom notices that there is no bread in the cupboard. She
gives her twelve-year-old son a five-dollar bill and says, <i>“Take your
bicycle and go down to the convenience store and buy a loaf of bread for
dinner.”</i> As he gets to the end of the driveway, however, he meets the
neighbor lady backing out. When he finds out that she is going to the
supermarket for a few groceries, he rides with her to the supermarket and buys
two loaves of French bread.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Has he disobeyed his mother? He bought two
loaves rather than one, he bought French bread rather than regular bread, he
went in the neighbor’s car instead of riding his bicycle, and he went to the
supermarket, not the convenience store. We would surely judge that he did not
disobey her even though he did not do what she told him. Bread is cheaper at
the supermarket, so he can get two loaves of French bread for half again as
much; he knows that his family uses enough bread that the second loaf will not
go to waste. He gets two loaves because there will be six people eating supper,
so one loaf would be “cutting it close”; he supposes that his mother said one
loaf only because she did not want to pay a high price for regular bread.
Furthermore, he knows the family is having spaghetti for dinner, and they
normally have French bread with spaghetti; so he surmises that she just said
bread because the convenience store does not carry French bread. Going in the
neighbor’s car will not make him late getting the bread for dinner; and the
neighbor is a friend he knows the family trusts, so there is no danger. He
judges that his mother told him to ride his bike only because the convenience
store was three blocks away, which might make it a fairly long walk there and
back, and because she was not taking into consideration the fact that the
neighbor was about to leave for the supermarket. He supposes that she told him
to go to the convenience store because the supermarket is two miles away on the
other side of two busy, four-lane streets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In each part of this example, the son’s
decisions derive from his knowledge of the nature of the case, knowledge he
gained from experience rather than from his mother’s statement. We say he has
obeyed the spirit of her words; he has conformed his action to her imperatival
intent. He does not deserve to be disciplined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The difficulty with women’s studies,
however, is that we are not as certain about the nature of the case as the
twelve-year-old boy was about buying bread. Personal relationships across
gender differences is <u>complicated</u>, and human experience is <u>unclear</u>.
We fear also that we have some blind spots in gender relationships because of <u>personal
and cultural perversions</u>. Moreover, there is <u>limited biblical
information</u> on this subject, and it contains <u>seemingly foreign elements</u>
like veil-wearing and silence behavior, which seem unnatural or extreme to us. In
addition, we can see <u>two levels</u> to the male-female relationship issue—a
choice between (1) egalitarianism and hierarchy and between the female
submission principle itself in hierarchy as distinguished from (2) the cultural
manifestations of that principle. The imperatival intent in statements about
manifestation of the female submission principle is not necessarily the same as
the imperatival intent about the submission principle itself—as imperatives
about veil-wearing apparently show. Likewise, imperatival intent in statements
about the female submission principle is not necessarily to require the female
submission principle <i>per se</i>—as imperatives about slavery submission
show. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Apparently we can somehow get behind the
imperatives themselves and look at other information that has implications for
the authors’ imperatival intent. Other information includes relevant <u>didactic
material</u> about the nature of men and women or about any difference in God’s
intended purposes he states for them. <u>Historical information</u> about what
women did with divine approval may help. <u>Human experience</u> also has its
place as long as we make the bases for judgments as broad as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  If the descriptive-form statement is,
in fact, meant as a prescriptive statement, is the directive given within an <b>assumed

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Is the directive meant in the <b>assumed
limitation</b> of the day because <u>teaching</u> then was viewed a directive
and authoritative? If so, teaching in a setting where people do not invest it
with supervisory authority would be outside Paul’s frame of reference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Is the directive given because in
the <b>assumed limitation</b> quietness communicated subjection and teaching
would not be quietness?  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Is the directive given in an <b>assumed

implied authority, would be “out of place”?</span></p>

The question is not so much whether we translate the word as “woman,” but
whether Paul has in mind a <b>standard situation</b>, that is, a married
woman—in effect a wife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Despite the descriptive <u>form</u>
of his statement, does Paul mean his (equivalent to an) imperative as <b>advice
</b>or <b>commandment</b>? Advice would mean that doing otherwise would not be
disobeying Paul but risking problems he wanted them to avoid. In effect, the
directive would mean that letting women teach men was not advisable. This
quality of the comment could allow the practice of a strong generality <i>vs</i>.
an absolute uniformity. The advice-imperative could be based on all the
natural, specific-situational, and general-cultural factors that would lead to
a practical conclusion that a woman should not teach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Even if Paul did mean <b>commandment</b>
<i>vs.</i> advice in the culture he was originally addressing, would he have
reduced it to advice in a setting like ours, a setting that may lie outside his
<b>assumed limitation</b>? So to speak, do some commands reduce to advice or
suggestion—or even zero—in settings different from the original one? The New
Testament letters, especially the pastorals, have had to serve two roles: they
are (1) vehicles of timeless truth, and they were (2) vehicles of situational
practice. The principles in the former led to applications in the latter;
consequently, we must understand the principles of the former when we apply
them to different circumstances.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The pastorals give imperatives about
practical matters all the way from ideal practice through practice in already
perverted situations down to the level of what sounds like <u>bylaw material</u>:
“Don’t enroll a widow under sixty years old” (1 Timothy <b>5</b>:9). Would the
readers have disobeyed by enrolling a widow that was fifty-five? Even if <u>they</u>
would have been disobedient, would <u>we</u> be disobedient in using sixty-five
as a “soft” minimum, because of the greater longevity in modern America? These
letters use imperatives that express <u>generalities</u> with untold
exceptions: <i>“Refuse [to enroll] younger widows because they will become
self-indulgent . . . idle, tattlers and busybodies . . .”</i> (1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:11-13).
Would the Ephesian Christians have been disobeying Paul by not paying one of
the elders who ruled well and labored in the word (1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:17)? Since
Paul tells him not to receive an accusation against an elder except from two or
three witnesses, would Timothy have been disobeyed in receiving such an
accusation by <u>one</u> reliable witness on a crucial matter (1 Timothy <b>5</b>:19)?
Could there have been circumstances where a recent Jewish convert like Paul or
Apollos could immediately become involved in the formal leadership ministry of
the church (1 Timothy <b>5</b>:22; cp. Acts <b>9</b>:1-<u>25</u>; <b>18</b>:24-28)?
What if Timothy preferred not to risk addiction by heeding Paul’s imperative on
the medicinal use of wine for his stomach (1 Timothy <b>5</b>:23)? Does Paul approve
of slavery by telling slaves to respect their masters (1 Timothy <b>6</b>:1)?
Is it disobedience for men not to raise their hands when they pray (<b>2</b>:8)
or for women to braid their hair (<b>2</b>:9)? Did Paul himself disobey his own
imperative against circumcising Gentiles when he circumcised Timothy (note Acts
<b>15</b>:1-29 + <b>16</b>:1-3 + 4)? These examples are not all exactly like
the imperatives on female formal leadership over men; there is more to
implementing Paul’s ancient directives in our modern situation than merely
observing that he uses the imperatives in regard to them. After all, it <u>would</u>
be disobedience for Timothy not to exercise himself to godliness even if he
were living today (1 Timothy <b>4</b>:7).</span></p>

of the case” means more than the creatable, or substantive, nature of
something. It includes relational and active aspects—substance, action, and
relationship being the fundamental components of every reality. Purpose is one
aspect down inside the relational category; consequently, when we speak of “the
nature of the case,” we include more than is discernible on an empirical basis,
because empirical evidence is rooted only in the creatable nature and what it
makes possible. But there is not a one-for-one relationship between purpose and
creatable nature when it comes to humankind; otherwise, we would be locked into
positive determinism rather than just restrictive determinism. Human nature is
more variable than the divine purposes for humans. Consequently, clinical
observation cannot always determine how people should act to be well pleasing
to God. What is pleasing to him rests more directly on his purposes for people
than on the created nature people have in consequence of the divine purpose it
reflects.</span></p>
