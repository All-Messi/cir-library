and Women’s Roles</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Paul appeals to the sequence of creation
and the manner of the fall for his not allowing women to teach or to exercise
authority over men. One inference is that (1) <u>Paul appeals to Genesis to <i>confirm</i></u>,
rather than to <i>prove</i>, the propriety of his custom; it is a <i>post facto</i>
appeal rather than an <i>a priori</i> one. He says what he says by his own
authority rather than because of a historical divine reason. His authoritative
conclusion rests on some practical consideration rather than a theological one.
Then cultural propriety can be the basis; so outside the first-century
circumstance, it does not necessarily apply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
color:windowtext'>An</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> even looser
connection with Genesis exists if (2) <u>Paul appeals to Genesis to <i>illustrate</i></u>,
rather than prove, his point. He would be doing so the way Jude appeals to the
Book of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses to illustrate his own <u>truth claims</u>,
not to imply that either <u>event</u> actually happened or that either <u>book</u>
was true or canonical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul gives no cue that he is making such a
loose connection with this subject. In the advice to virgins in 1 Corinthians <b>7</b>
and the Sarah-Hagar parallel in Galatians <b>4</b>:21-31, he provides cues that
he is not making an <i>a priori</i> observation. While an <i>a priori</i> approach
seems preferable</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>, he
could have </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>more than one connection in
mind. (3) <u>Paul may appeal to Genesis to show man’s relative headship over
woman</u> rather than also to prove specifically women should not teach. The
last part would be his inference from the Genesis event.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><img width=423 height=219

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The accompanying diagram maps out the argument pattern.
The main point lies in distinguishing (<b>B</b>) relative
responsibility/headship from manifesting it in (<b>C</b>) teaching men. For
comparison, we have pictured a parallel with 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>, which
deals with an issue more obviously conditioned by cultural considerations. In 1
Timothy, Paul does not have to be using Genesis as a basis for both steps. Genesis
<b>2-3</b> may establish a historical basis for relative headship because <i>the
sequence and manner of creating woman</i> manifests God’s intentions for
man-woman association (Genesis <b>2</b> more clearly speaks in relational
terms) and because <i>the manner and sequence of the fall </i>manifests
something about their propensities (men too susceptible to female influence and
women too susceptible to a sense of limitation?). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Besides whether Paul’s policy proscribed unofficial
teaching of men by women (see below), a cultural variable may come into
settings where modern culture does not regard teaching as authoritative and if
the kind of teaching women often do now is not done in an authoritative manner.
If no one-for-one tie exists between step (<b>B</b>) and step (<b>C</b>)
because of demeanor or culture or type of teaching, and if Paul means to
connect Genesis <b>2-3 </b>only with step (<b>B</b>), then his directive </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>allows </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>some flexibility in the propriety of women’s “teaching” officially and
in their teaching men in the modern setting. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            New Testament writers appeal to Old
Testament scripture in a variety of ways. Without comment Acts <b>15</b>:19-20
+ 28-29, for example, appeals to Moses as a basis for not eating meat offered
to idols, while in 1 Corinthians <b>8</b> and Romans <b>14</b> Paul deals with
eating meat as a matter of responsibility around weaker brothers. The Acts <b>15
</b>missive<b> </b>mixes this <i>practical </i>issue with a <i>moral</i> issue (fornication)
and a <i>ceremonial</i> one (not eating blood). Modern interpreters need to distinguish
moral, ceremonial, and practical issues before they apply that precedent to the
current situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            By saying “I,” does Paul imply that not
having women teach men is a practical, pastoral custom he follows? Does it have
a force like his comments in 1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:25ff. about virgins
marrying? He gives his judgment first as someone the Lord considers trustworthy
and second as something affected by the present distress. He makes it clearer
there than here that he is addressing the <u>current situation</u>. In that
situation was <i>persecution</i>; in the teaching issue it would be <i>cultural
expectancy</i>. <u>Women’s teaching men</u>, then, is categorized along with <u>veil-wearing</u>,
<u>silence in church</u>, and <u>slaves’ submitting to masters</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If Paul directs Timothy for the situation
in Ephesus, does what he says not apply to other first-century situations where
the reason for his directives did not exist? While it is possible to see how
Paul’s statements could represent his custom because of the cultural situation,
it is difficult to take <i>“I do not allow”</i> as something applicable just to
Ephesus. The New Testament witnesses to a great degree of mobility among
Christians. The apostolic writings were circulated early on and intentionally
so. Observing that the context does not likely have a <u>geographical
limitation</u>, leaves unsettled whether it has a <u>cultural limitation</u>.

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Paul
would surely not mean that women could not teach in any sense or circumstance
whatever. He speaks elsewhere about women teaching younger women (Titus <b>2</b>:3-5)
and implies that women taught children (2 Timothy <b>1</b>:5). <i>“Teaching the
younger women to love their husbands”</i> does not sound especially private <i>vs</i>.
public. The choice seems clearly limited to options (3) and (4) for the
following reasons. Otherwise, how could a wife win her husband if she were
forbidden from explaining why she conducts her life the way she does (1 Peter <b>3</b>:1-2)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (a)  Paul is heading into characteristics
for elders in <b>3</b>:1-7, where teaching distinguishes their responsibility from
deacons’ work. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (b)  Elsewhere, teaching labels the elders’
work (Acts <b>20</b>:28-32; Ephesians <b>4</b>:11; 1 Timothy <b>5</b>:7; Titus.
<b>1</b>:5-9). In Antioch, The Acts does not mention elders, but it does
mention prophets and <i>teachers</i> (<b>13</b>:1). Other places that may have
elders’ teaching in view are Romans<b> 12</b>:7; 1 Timothy <b>1</b>:7; Hebrews <b>13</b>:7,
17, 24. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (c)  The elders’ dual role of ruling and
teaching combines here in 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:12 as in the upcoming characteristics
list and in <b>5</b>:17; Titus <b>1</b>:5-9; Acts <b>20</b>:28; and 1 Peter<b>
5</b>:2. These same two aspects are covered by the shepherd image because a
shepherd <u>manages</u> and <u>feeds</u> the flock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (d)  Women not teaching men in an official
sense would square with Philip’s four virgin daughters who prophesied, an
activity whose legitimacy rested on its content rather than additionally on the
authority of an office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It seems clear that Paul is talking about
teaching in the sense of what an elder was to do. That work was especially
important prior to the writing of the New Testament, because during the absence
of the apostles, Christians had no access to normative teaching. The teaching
that elders did was not just imparting information. It was official teaching,
which added responsibility and therefore authority to their efforts. The teaching
work was normative and pre-canonical as by an elder, not just informative. Teaching
would not be the same thing, then, as prophesying, because an elder held an
authoritative office whereas a prophet performed a charismatic function;
teaching was authoritative communication while prophesying was not. (See below
under “The Meaning of ‘Silent.’”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            At this point, we may ask questions about
culture and circumstance. Did all teaching in the first-century church have the
character of official teaching? More to the point, did people of the first
century tend to look on public teaching as something authoritative? We have
inferred that Paul meant official teaching. We wonder whether the “teaching”
that goes on even in a typical adult Sunday school class today has the feel
that Paul envisioned in 1 Timothy <b>2</b>. Often the “teacher” is more a
discussion leader than someone that imparts normative information. The authority
a teacher does have is not so much about content as procedure—the “right” to
begin and close class, to recognize which participant will contribute next, and
the like. A person’s <i>demeanor</i> while carrying out such a role has a lot
to do with whether it is regarded as authoritative. The <i>church role</i> he
has also impacts the character of his teaching work. As per these
considerations, a woman’s “teaching” an adult Sunday school class would not
automatically fall within Paul’s frame of reference, especially if her role is
discussion leader rather than official teaching and/or if she does it without
an air of assumed authority.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            See Scott Bartchy’s argument in “Power,
Submission, and Sexual Identity Among the Early Christians,” <i>Essays on New

beyond usurping and exercising authority. But there must be more to the issue
than domineering, because men are not to carry themselves that way either; yet
Paul makes a difference between men and women in that women are to act in
deference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is one more point about
authoritative <i>vs</i>. purely interpersonal interaction. In modern western
societies that stress the democratic process and freedom of speech, the first
impulse during interactions is not so likely to be “who is in charge here.” It
is more about who knows what they are talking about. Individuals feel a right
to express themselves aside from any consideration about having the official right
to do so, and they do it among people that look at it the same way. So, the
responsibility aura is less prominent all around, and raising questions about
whether someone has a right to speak seems out of place.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> are parallel entries or whether they form a combination
that taken together means “teach authoritatively” (hendiadys).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Greek uses case endings to indicate
grammatical functions within a sentence. A reader would expect that a noun can
be the common object of a double verb if both verbs govern the same case. (a)
In 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:12 </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>διδάσκειν</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>is used
absolutely (no object indicated) while </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> governs the genitive. It
would seem most likely then that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ανδρός</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> is the object only of </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, since
it is genitive case. (b) Another disjunctive aspect of the verse is the
presence of “neither” (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>οὐδέ</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>). The second verb with its adjuncts seems to be a
second grammatical entry. If so, <i>teach</i> does, in fact, mean <i>“I do not
allow a woman to teach”</i> (period) <i>vs</i>. <i>“I do not allow a woman to
teach (a man).”</i> <u>But</u>, that does not mean she can teach only women and
children <u>if</u> we understand that <i>teach</i> is being used in the sense
of official teaching (as in the teaching done by elders, the topic Paul goes on
to address in the beginning of the next chapter). Under this reconstruction
Paul means that women are not to be official teachers; that is, they are not to
function like teaching elders. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>NOTE: If Paul means </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>διδάσκειν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (seq.
acc.) and </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> (seq. gen.) as a composite, he creates a situation
where the noun the verbs govern cannot be both cases. In similar situations,
the nearest element can determine the form of the sequential term. A singular plus
plural compound subject has the verb in the number of the nearest subject; a
predicate adjective after a compound subject of different genders can have the
gender of the nearest subject; an attributive adjective with two nouns of
different gender can carry the gender of the nearest noun. Under that analysis,
the reason </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀνδρός</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> is genitive is that it follows the nearest verb, not
that it relates only to that verb. The reason “man” does not appear after each
verb may be that the verbs <u>are</u> together as composites (hendiadys);
Paul’s directive would then apply to teaching authoritatively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As far as <u>concept</u> is involved,
however, the point can still be made that Paul is thinking about
authoritatively teaching men. It is just that grammatically he divides up the
idea into two parts: (a) she is not to teach authoritatively and (b) she is not
to exercise authority over men. The combination still means that she is not to
teach authoritatively men (or anyone else, for that matter). The concern then
about her teaching unauthoritatively children, women, or even men lies outside
Paul’s frame of reference.</span></p>

alternative in “Where Is the Command to Silence?” <i>Christian Standard</i>,
May 21, l989, p. 4. Whatever being <i>silent</i> means here in<b> 2</b>:11, 12
(cp. </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>σιγάω</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> in 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34), it evidently does not
eliminate “prophesying” (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:5; Acts <b>21</b>:9). The only
other New Testament uses of </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> are in Acts <b>22</b>:2, where the quieted mob in the
temple became even more silent when they heard Paul addressing them in Hebrew (<b>21</b>:40
+ <b>22</b>:2), and in 2 Thessalonians <b>3</b>:12, where Paul tells certain <i>“lazy
and disorderly busybodies”</i> (<b>3</b>:11) to work <i>“with quietness”</i>
and eat their own food. People with nothing to do can fill their time with
gossiping, <i>etc</i>. The cognate adjective occurs in 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:2,
where Paul encourages prayer for political leaders so Christians might lead a “quiet”
life, and in 1 Peter <b>3</b>:4, which instructs women to “adorn” themselves
with a meek and “quiet” spirit in contrast to showy appearance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In 2 Thessalonians the word (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>)
apparently represents the opposite of clamoring disorderliness. 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>
has this same set—orderliness and silence—that Paul contrasts in forbidding
women to “speak” (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>λαλεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>). The “silence/quietness” (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>) given to
Paul by the mob in Acts<b> 22</b> again contrasts with their previous shouting
and violence (<b>21</b>:34-35). The great “silence” (<b>21</b>:40, </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>σιγή</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>)
became “more quietness” (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>). The two nouns must have related meanings, or the
second could not be used to intensify the first. Perhaps </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>adds the implication of respect. In Acts <b>22</b> the
mob may have shown some respect because Paul was speaking to them in Aramaic
rather than Greek or classical Hebrew rather than Aramaic. 2 Timothy<b> 2</b>,
Acts <b>22</b>, and 1 Corinthians <b>14</b> involve a combination of
orderliness, quietness/silence, and respect. In 2 Timothy <b>2</b> </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
stands not only in contrast to teaching (where there is speaking), but also in
contrast to exercising authority over men. So “peacefulness,” “respect,” and “deference”
are in the situation if not in the meaning of the word </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, but it
would not be accurate to say that the word meant “peaceful” <u>instead of</u> “silence”
because it contrasts with teaching and parallels <i>deference</i> (<b>2</b>:11).
The context, hence the word, involves both silence and deference. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The meaning of words is fine-tuned by their
circumstances. In these cases, <i>silence</i>, whether covered by the </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>σιγή</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> or </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχία</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>,
serves as a synonym for deference (2 Timothy <b>2</b>:11, 13; 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34a,
b). Paul and Luke use the concept as an approximate opposite of disrespectful,
disorderly noisiness, which can vary all the way up to riotousness. In the
church setting, that “silence” contrasts at least with (a) badgering questions
(1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34-35). We have inferred “badgering,” or “carping,”
questions because that is one way to harmonize the text with Paul’s earlier
approval of women prophesying (<b>11</b>:5; cp. Acts <b>21</b>:9). This silence
also contrasts with (b) speaking in untranslated languages, because the women
in Corinth were to be silent like the untranslated language-speakers (<b>14</b>:28,
30). In 1 Timothy<b> 2</b> the women’s silence contrasts with (c) teaching. We
have argued earlier that “teaching” seems to mean “official teaching” in 2
Timothy since in other texts women did other kinds of teaching. Finally, women’s
silence contrasts with (d) exercising authority over men. In both 2 Timothy (<b>2</b>:11)
and 1 Corinthians (<b>14</b>:34), the concern is about not breaching the deference
principle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There are similarities between 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:8-14
and 1 Peter <b>3</b>:1-6. The mention of dress and adornment in both contexts
along with “quietness,” “meekness,” and “deference” may suggest that the </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡσυχι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>-
root contrasts with showy or loud dressing as attention-getting behavior. 1
Timothy <b>2</b> and 1 Peter<b> 3</b> use the same terminology to describe
behavior in the church, in the first instance, and behavior in the
home/marriage, in the second text. That point reinforces the contention that
the structure of the church and behaviors there need to correlate with the
structure and behaviors in the home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Women’s silence apparently does not
prohibit (e) women’s prophesying. This last point is somewhat less certain
because the previous context in 1 Corinthians <b>14</b> involves prophesying. But
because of 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:5 and Acts<b> 21</b>:9, there is evidently
some sense or circumstance in which women could prophesy without opprobrium. Perhaps
the female prophesying in chapter <b>11</b> and with Philip’s four daughters was
<u>not “in church”</u> (<b>14</b>:19, 28; could “in the <i>churches</i>” mean “in
the <i>church services</i>”?), or was <u>with women or children</u>. Perhaps it
was done <u>within the parameters of female deference etiquette</u>. A woman
might be <u>asked</u> to share, for example. In responding she would not be “usurping”
(cp. that possible meaning of </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> in 2 Timothy <b>2</b>:12) as she would if she tried
to “take her turn” right along with the male presenters (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:26-35).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Silence for untranslated language-speakers
would not prohibit them from speaking in the native language or in translated languages.
In like manner, the silence for women is not silence in every sense or
circumstance, but in contrast to prohibited things (the hermeneutical law of
opposition). The prohibited thing seems to disregarding female deference (1 Corinthians<b>
14</b>:34b, <i>“in deference as says the law”</i>;<b> 11</b>:10, <i>“authority
on her </i></span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>head</span></i><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>; 2 Timothy<b>
2</b>:11, <i>“with deference”</i>). Consequently, <i>silence</i> amounts to a
synonym for <i>quiet demeanor</i>, <i>deference behavior</i>, and the
prohibition forbids competitive behavior because it manifests a rejection of
the female deference principle. Clamoring for attention by asking badgering
questions, insisting on speaking, assuming or demanding equal access, trying to
“tell the men how it is,” and the like would have been especially out of place.
Competitive behavior was <u>unacceptable</u> for men too (1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:8;
<b>3</b>:2-3) because it would be counterproductive; but more than that, it
would have been <u>embarrassing</u> to see women do it (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:35).
Not only would they not be edifying the church, but they would also not have
been “keeping their place.” In a culture where certain behavior was expected
from women in mixed public settings, their trying too hard to get involved with
questions, prophesying, and teaching would have compromised the deference
principle. Not only was it “out of place” and “pushy,” but women would have had
a harder time getting involved appropriately because they themselves would have
felt out of place going against expectancy. If they had to override their own
inhibitions to do it, it would “show.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Speaking in a way that implied deference
would not come under Paul’s prohibition even in Paul’s own day, things like
unofficial teaching in a mixed setting, teaching women and children,
prophesying in mixed settings. However, in the modern Western world, public
involvement is not so readily construed as insubordination. On the one hand,
the cultural variable widens the range of options because more activities are
now regarded as non-authoritative, and so no breach of deference if a woman
does them. Speaking, teaching, and veil-wearing have meanings that are in part
culturally infused. In our culture, not wearing a veil does not connote
insubordination; similarly, a woman’s speaking up in public does not mean
insubordination; by the same token, teaching is not automatically associated
with authority and, therefore, with insubordination if a woman does it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On the other hand, there is more to the
meaning of activities among believers than the meanings that are culturally
infused. There are also meanings that are biblically infused into certain
activities because scripture assigns them to certain roles. Official teaching
could not be turned over to female responsibility, but much of the teaching
that women do in our setting would probably not qualify as official teaching. It
is especially less problematic when a woman carries herself with an attitude
that is appropriate to her supportive role in marriage, home, and church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In group settings, who has <u>responsibility</u>
is a consideration because organization creates orderliness for better
accomplishing the purposes of the group. <u>Authority</u> comes in to reinforce
responsibility for various facets and levels in the operation. <u>Deference</u>
means conducting oneself in a way that allows those with responsibility to
fulfill it to God for the church/family and the world. In the home and the
church, the New Testament seems clear that God has assigned to <u>husbands</u> final
responsibility—hence authority—in the family and to elders final responsibility
in the local church. Wives are to conduct themselves in a manner that
recognizes the greater responsibility God has laid on their husbands in the
home. Women are to conduct themselves in a manner that recognizes the greater
responsibility God has laid on men in the church. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The primary point in the first section
above is that Paul’s arguments from the Old Testament establish the first
point, namely, that men are more ultimately responsible for the operation of
the body of believers than women are. The cultural variable does not eradicate
that point, but it does affect applications to such things as teaching,
veil-wearing, and silence, because cultures do not invest these activities with
the same meaning relative to the authority issue. Female deference is the
underlying principle, and these gestures that communicate deference may be
culturally conditioned by the first-century setting where they were given. That
has been the judgment of modern interpreters relative to veil-wearing; by
parity of reason, we may say something similar about female teaching and
silence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Within that framework we propose the
following way of handling the other specifics within 2 Timothy <b>2</b>:8-15. Paul
is not addressing a localized situation in Ephesus; he is laying down
directives used everywhere, including Corinth. When he speaks of “teaching,” he
means official teaching as done by an elder, which evidently differs from
prophesying because the latter does not include the authority overlay. More
basically Paul says that he does not allow a woman to exercise authority over a
man, much less usurp such authority or try to be domineering toward him. <i>“Being
silent” </i>means that a woman conducts herself in a manner consonant with her deferring
posture and supportive role. Paul’s appeal to Genesis connects with step (<b>B</b>)
and not automatically with step (<b>C</b>) as well. Distinguishing (<b>B</b>)
and (<b>C</b>) ends up not affecting much the interpretation of 2 Timothy <b>2</b>
if we take Paul to mean “teaching” officially, that is, in a responsible
position and demeanor. He is not prohibiting teaching in the absolute but in
respect to what Paul has in mind, the work of elders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the modern setting, there may be some
adjustment in the application of deference to a woman’s teaching activity, but
it should not go beyond prophesying to official teaching. Activities in mixed
settings that today might not vitiate Paul’s principle would include leading
discussions, imparting information, especially if requested to do so; giving testimonies
to general audiences; asking honest questions. Obviously, teaching other women
and teaching children do not fall within Paul’s purview.</span></p>
