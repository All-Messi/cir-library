<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One point in 1 Timothy <b>2</b> has to do
with husband-wife <i>vs</i>. man-woman as Paul’s intended reference. Connecting
the statements of 1 Timothy with (a) a husband-wife contrast rather than (b) a
man-woman contrast represents a crucial variable between instruction on marriage
roles <i>vs</i>. gender roles. A third approach to the text has something of
the same effect but seems to be more straightforward and therefore less cumbersome:
(c) Paul is addressing “standard situation,” that is, married with children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Advantages of that tack on <u>women’s
studies</u> include the following: <b>(1)</b> <u>it fits into a general manner
of dealing with issues</u> in the New Testament, not only on women’s issues but
on other subjects and not only in Paul but elsewhere. For example, New
Testament writers speak of <u>baptism</u> in terms of standard situations. We
are not told what to do with “hard cases” like a leper who decides to become a
Christian (cp. someone in our own day who wants to accept Christ in an ICU or a
north Alaskan Eskimo who wants to be baptized in December). Closer to our study
area is Paul’s will that <u>younger widows</u> remarry. Likewise in 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:15
the apostle speaks of a <u>woman as bearing/rearing children</u> without
verbalizing an aside that exempts barren women. In 1 Corinthians<b> 14</b>:34,
where he addresses <u>women asking questions</u> in the gathered assembly (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐκκλησία</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>,
<i>ekklēsia</i>), he phrases his directive in terms of women who have husbands,
whereas a significant minority would not be married. In 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>
Paul discusses <u>veil-wearing</u> as per standard situation: the man being the
head of the woman (<b>11</b>:3), woman created for the man (<b>11</b>:9), the
man and the woman are not without each other in the Lord (<i>i.e.,</i> are not
to operate individually, <b>11</b>:12), the references to the creation account,
and so on. The <u>creation account</u> itself envisions standard situation It serves
as the historical and doctrinal foundation for all other biblical statements
about men-women relationships in the Bible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A second advantage of standard situation is
that <b>(2) </b><u>it does not depend so heavily on vocabulary arguments and
close grammatical distinctions</u> that are often too difficult to establish
and may only correlate with conclusions that are possible but not necessary or
obviously preferable. Among other things, we need not assume the task of
showing when </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀνήρ</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<i>anēr</i>) and </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>γυνή</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<i>gunē</i>)
mean <i>“man and woman” </i>rather than <i>“husband and wife.”</i> Instead, we
appeal to more basic contextual factors that vocabulary decisions end up being
based on anyway. In 1 Timothy <b>2</b>, for example, Paul envisions a married
situation since he speaks of women raising children (<b>2</b>:15). Even his
references to Adam and Eve (<b>2</b>:13-14) are clearly husband-wife references
because Adam and Eve were spouses. It becomes then a further question decided
by considerations whether and how the comments in Genesis <b>1-3</b>, 1 Timothy<b>
2</b>, or 1 Corinthians<b> 11</b> and<b> 14</b> apply to male-female circumstances
aside from marriage. In other words, again, Genesis <b>1-3</b> is itself a
description of standard situation.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Agreeing that when Paul addresses standard
situation in 1 Timothy <b>2</b> and elsewhere, does not remove the texts from
questions about gender roles. We are faced with why he addresses the standard
situation as he does. Speaking of circumstances aside from marriage, we could
assume that God had natural reasons for ordering husband-wife relationships as
he did, reasons we have elsewhere called “relative gifting,” which are by
degree true of men and women statistically speaking, regardless of marital
status. So even though Paul is speaking in 1 Timothy of a husband-wife
circumstance (standard situation), we do not automatically take his comments
purely as culturally conditioned (<u>culture</u>) practices relative to
marriage only or sheer will-of-God mandates (<u>authority</u>) only for the
sake of good order. Those comments may be rooted in <u>created nature</u>,
which God bestowed in conformity to the nature of the larger circumstance he
was bringing into being—marriage and society. They would be true of men in
contrast to women regardless of marital status or cultural circumstance. This
point can then be related to <u>wisdom <i>vs</i>. law</u> as the sense in which
Paul means what he indicates in these verses to Timothy as well as in his other
texts about related issues.</span></p>
