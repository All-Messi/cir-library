<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(a)</b> The <u>law of contrast</u>
implies that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> does not mean “dominate” since it is a correlative
term with </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὑποταγή</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> in the previous verse. </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ἐν</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>πάσῃ</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'> </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὑποταγῇ</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> and </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> seem to be correlative expressions like <i>learn</i>
and <i>teach</i>, with which they appear. Correlative terms stand in a common
larger category as natural contrasts: lost-saved, father-son, prophecy-fulfillment,
faith-works, and the like. Within the same context the sense in which one is
meant is the sense in which the other is used. If <i>father</i> means physical
father, then <i>son</i> means physical son, not spiritual son. If <i>prophesy</i>
means to state a significant principle, then <i>fulfill</i> means to be an
example of that principle, not the occurrence of a prediction. Correlative
terms obey the law of contrast/opposition/negation inside the law of harmony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Correlative terms and the law of contrast
may help establish the meaning of </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> in this passage. Since it appears only once in the
New Testament, scholars in women’s studies have diligently collected examples
of the word in other settings. The difficulty with the results of such
painstaking research is that the evidence for an intense, negative connotation
(“domineer,” “murder”) may be due more to their differing contexts than to the
conventional meaning of the word itself. Besides, usages drawn from across
several centuries run the risk of lexical drift. Observations on derivation,
constituent morphemes, and cognate words are likewise helpful but not
satisfactory because word meanings are established by usage more than
derivation, constituents, and related terms.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Appealing to the law of contrast with
correlating terms cuts through the ambiguous and conflicting results of these
other procedures. Contrast suggests that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> does not have a negative
connotation, because being in subjection does not have a connotation. If </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
means <i>“dominate”</i> or <i>“be autocratic</i>,<i>”</i> we would expect </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐν</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>
</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>πάσῃ</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὑποταγῇ</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> to mean <i>“in reticence.”</i> The contrast would be
between dominating and not dominating. The dignity of all human persons
requires that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὑποταγή</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> bear a positive connotation in parent-children and
husband-wife relationships. It means associating with the other person in a way
that recognizes that the other person is the being held responsible. The law of
contrast creates the expectancy that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> means <i>“exercise
authority over.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(b)</b> In a second application of the
law of contast, we would expect a contrast between deferring and not deferring,
rather than between deferring and “domineeringly” not deferring. In contrast to
the previous entry about unlike connotations, the point here is that the “size”
of the ideas is not the same. One category (deference) is set in contrast to a
subdivision of the opposite category (oversee domineeringly).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(c)</b> Likewise, the <u>law of harmony</u>
implies that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> does not mean <i>“dominate”</i> since it pairs with </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>διδάσκειν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>.
This observation holds true especially if the verbs are parallel rather than conflated.
If the two verbs express one composite idea, however, the whole could have a
negative feel (<i>“to teach with a domineering air”</i>), although the
prohibition seems too specific for the flow of the text. Furthermore, a
negative composite idea would run counter again to expectancy from the law of
contrast with correlative terms. The negative expression <i>“teach domineeringly”</i>
would not naturally contrast with the neutral expression <i>“be in complete deference</i>,<i>”</i>
or perhaps <i>“be in deference in everything.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(d)</b> The <u>law of harmony</u>
implies that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> does not mean dominate, since </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> plus “teach”
parallels the distinctive roles of elders given in the next paragraph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(e)</b> We would expect Paul to warn <u>men</u>
not to be domineering toward <u>women</u>, because that is surely a more common
problem. In his household teaching (Ephesians <b>5</b>:22-<b>6</b>:11;
Colossians <b>3</b>:18-4:1; and 1 Timothy <b>6</b>:1-3), he warns in each case
against the typical faults of each member. Peter follows the same pattern in
his first epistle (<b>2</b>:18-<b>3</b>:7). Such would not be the case here if </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
carried a negative implication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(f)</b> No one should be domineering
toward anyone else. Paul would not specify that <u>women</u> not be domineering
over men when there is no reason to single them out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(g)</b> Assuming a neutral connotation
for </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> would conform to the principle of <u>minimum
affirmation</u>. The more precise meaning requires more precise evidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For these contextual reasons, it is more
natural to adopt the reading “exercising authority over” rather than “domineer.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Because of derivation and some uses that
mean “murder,” researchers often conclude that </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
connotes intensity and therefore domineering leadership. Perhaps, however, the
implication about intensive degree is not in the <u>manner</u> but the <u>level</u>
of exercising authority. The implication would not be negative but final. It
would mean exercising final authority. It would not then be a synonym for (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>κατα</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>)</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>κυριεύω</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
(note Matthew <b>20</b>:25; Luke <b>22</b>:25; 2 Corinthians <b>1</b>:24). “Exercising
final authority” would fit our conviction that Paul is talking about women not
exercising authority over men in the final slots of home and church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Although the word is paired with a neutral
term, it could in effect have a negative turn because of a special feature of
role-reversal. A writer might mean that when women try to exercise authority
over men, it comes off as domineering because it is unnatural both to them and observers.
The women would be straining to do what “goes against the grain,” something
that feels “backwards” and uncomfortable for them. New or inadequate people in
authority positions often come on too strong because they are compensating for
that sense of inadequacy. The phenomenon shows up with new husbands, parents
who have children they feel they cannot control, policemen new to the job,
people trying to lead in the face of prejudice, and so on. Paul’s point would
be, <i>“I don’t let women oversee men because in effect it becomes domineering.”
</i>The likelihood of such a take is a matter of judgment. Paul does do something
similar in his comment about young widows “<i>being drawn away by sensuous
impulses”</i> (1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:11). An interpreter would be more apt to take
this tack on<b> 2</b>:11-12 as wisdom rather than law. Wisdom would allow it to
be a generality or significant possibility, which makes it a more likely true
observation Paul could mean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another way the law of contrast with
correlative terms would not require </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>αὐθεντεῖν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> to bear a neutral connotation is to suppose there is
a contrast between abuse and correct use. Paul would then be saying, <i>“Do not
domineer; be in subjection.”</i> The first is a corrective on the second; so
there would be a natural pairing: correct vs. incorrect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Are “teach” and “exercise authority” two verbs for one
composite idea</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>—<b>teach
authoritatively?</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Teaching and ruling are the two
distinctive activities of elders, the listing of whose characteristics is Paul’s
next topic. If he is anticipating that subject, the two verbs are not as likely
to form one composite idea. Teaching and ruling are two responsibilities in the
eldership role, and they would be operating at different times. There is ruling
that occurs aside from teaching, which means the two are not a composite;
hence, they are not a composite in <b>2</b>:12. If we take the two verbs as one
composite idea, we do not connect them with the distinctive responsibilities of
elders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Even if we do not conflate the verbs,
context indicates that Paul meant authoritative teaching because he contrasts
teaching with subjection expressed by quietness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Examples of two verbs for one composite
idea include Acts <b>10</b>:46 (<i>“They began to speak in languages and
magnify God”</i>), Acts <b>19</b>:6 (<i>“They spoke with languages and
prophesied”</i>), and Revelation <b>2</b>:20 (<i>“She teaches and seduces my
servants to commit adultery”</i>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Is Paul being descriptive or prescriptive when he
says, <i>“I do not allow a woman normatively to teach a man”</i>?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Although the <u>form</u> of statement is <u>de</u>scriptive,
its <u>meaning</u> could be <u>pre</u>scriptive. In <b>2</b>:8 Paul says
similarly, <i>“I want men in every place to pray. . . .” </i>Likewise, Titus <b>3</b>:8
says, <i>“I want you confidently to affirm these things so that they who have
believed in God may be careful about maintaining good works.”</i> On the other
hand, 1 Timothy <b>5</b>:14 says<i>, “I want younger widows to remarry . . .”</i>;
and Philippians <b>1</b>:12 says, <i>“I want you to know that . . .”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Is 2:11-12 a statement born of wisdom or is it a
command that would be disobeyed? </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(See
“Wisdom or Law?”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Taking
it as wisdom is a lesser affirmation. As wisdom, <b>(a) </b>it could be a
strong generality, a policy based on relative gifting (statistical by degree),
and could envision standard situation only. Wisdom would allow it to be based
on cultural and situational factors in addition to relative gifting. As wisdom,
<b>(b)</b> it could be said because male deference at church would not fit well
with female deference at home. As wisdom, (c) the “reason(s)” given in <b>2</b>:13-14
as well as elsewhere are reasons for wisdom rather than reasons for law; they
are reasons for advice against risk, not command against disobedience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Taking these verses as wisdom rather than
will-of-God <u>and</u> connecting them with elders’ distinctive qualifications
would imply that women could serve as elders. If women elders are unacceptable,
either<b> 2</b>:11-12 is will-of-God unto disobedience or the verses do not
connect with chapter <b>3</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Taking these verses as wisdom rather than
will-of-God forfeits husband headship in marriage, because headship reversals
would have to occur between home and church in some cases. Since husband
headship is not negotiable, then neither is male eldership and its equivalents;
and these verses are not just wisdom but law—in standard situations, at least.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            From the standpoint of wisdom, the wisdom
of not having women normatively teaching men could be that <u>the home is
structured in the opposite order</u>. The house connection in the context comes
in the last verse of chapter <b>2</b> and in the appeals to the order of
creation. The wisdom of not having women normatively teaching men also comes in
connection with relative gifting. The contextual connection comes with the
deception in the fall, the implication being that women are not as adept at
holistic thinking, being more narrowly referenced. They have a more difficult
time keeping the affective element distinct from the rational.</span></p>
