<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpreters have proposed several ways
for removing from present observance of New Testament directives about
male-female role relationship in the church and the home: 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:8-15;
1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:2-16; <b>14</b>:33b-36; Colossians <b>3</b>:18-19; and
1 Peter <b>3</b>:1-7. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One way has been to <b>(1)</b> <u>consider
female deference a fallen condition</u> (Genesis <b>3</b>:16). Now that Christ
has removed the curse, the principle no longer obtains. But the New Testament
injunctions appear after Christ would have removed this supposed “curse.” Besides,
“rule” (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt'>מָשַׁל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>, <i>mashal</i>)
in Genesis <b>3</b>:16 does not mean “rule” in some unwholesome sense as in a “cursed”
estate; elders are to “rule well” in the church (1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:17; Hebrews
<b>13</b>:7, 17) and in the home (1 Timothy <b>3</b>:4; cp. deacons in <b>3</b>:11).
Paul argues for female deference because the man was created first and the
woman was deceived. In 1 Corinthians<b> 11</b>:7-9 the apostle adds that she
was created from man and for man, and that Adam was created in the image of God
(in some sense, degree, directness, or manner that Eve was not (cp. Genesis <b>2</b>:21-23,
18).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> The five observations
pertain to events that occurred before any fallen condition existed.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> Moreover, the other elements of
the “fallen situation” in Genesis <b>3</b>:14-21 have not been removed. Lastly,
it is not a fallen condition that God is the head of Christ and that Christ is
the head of every man, observations that Paul lays parallel to the man as the
head of the woman (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:3; cp. Ephesians <b>5</b>:23-24).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A second way has been to (<b>2)</b> <u>see
inconsistency between the principle of equality enunciated in Galatians <b>3</b>:28
and the call for female deference</u>. Equality and deference are incompatible
because inferiority is supposedly the only reason for deference. (See, for
example, Virginia Mollenkott’s comment in the “Foreword” to Paul King Jewett’s <i>Man
as Male and Female</i>, p. 8.) New Testament writers did not see an implicit
contradiction between their Christian impulse toward interpersonal equality and
their cultural impulse toward male responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> There are at least four difficulties with the
inconsistency proposal. <b>First</b>, in the apostolic witness precisely,
inspiration surely has the purpose of avoiding such a situation as this. Otherwise,
we wonder what practical value the doctrine would have. <b>Second</b>,
inferiority is simply not the only reason for deference. A division of labor
can be assigned for practical purposes, period. Faculty members are not
inferior to the dean; a dean has responsibility assigned—as well as authority
appropriate to that responsibility—for the harmonious working of the academic
enterprise. Even if men and women were totally interchangeable, by positive
commandment<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3 </span>God could still
assign responsibility in a way that avoided neglecting important aspects of the
work.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> Finally, Paul’s
subject in Galatians is salvation; moving the sameness principle beyond his
subject loses the apostle’s authority for that move. (See </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>the essay in <i>Evangelical
Hermeneutics: Selected Essays from the 1994 Evangelical Theological Society
Convention.</i> Ed. by Michael Bauman and David Hall. Camp Hill, PA: Christian
Publications, Inc., 1995, pp. 123-45.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Third</b>, leadership rank does not correspond
with relative worth. The seven chosen in Acts <b>6</b> to serve tables were not
inferior to the twelve apostles, who did not want to turn aside from <i>“the
ministry of the word”</i> to serve tables (<b>6</b>:2, 4). Neither was serving
tables a task inferior to proclaiming the word of God. James uses <i>“visiting
the fatherless and widows”</i> as a prime example of <i>“pure and undefiled
religion”</i> (<b>1</b>:27). Confusing rank with worth represents a serious
error in egalitarianism. Being in charge is not a “perk,” and not being in
charge is not a “put down.” Leadership is responsibility for accomplishing
purpose, not position for indicating worth or stroking self-esteem. (See
comments in “Ministry Before Consensus on Women’s Roles in the Church,” pp.
2-3.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Roles in the home and the church are to be
understood in terms of Paul’s body figure (Romans <b>12</b>:3-8; 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:12-31;
cp. 1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:17). Good-bad, superior-inferior is always to be
figured relative to purpose. Who is to say whether seeing or hearing is
superior or more important? Eyes are not very good substitutes for ears and <i>vice
versa</i>. Which organ is most significant depends on the need in given cases,
but the given cases differ</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>,</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> and they involve many different functions
simultaneously. Christians are not to view leadership the way the world views
it (Luke <b>22</b>:24-30). The world’s tendency to base self-worth on success
in competition—success at gaining rank over others, in this case—is the
specific aspect of “worldliness” that does so much damage when it comes into
the church and the Christian home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Fourth</b>, we suspect that God has
correlated his assigning of fundamental role emphases with his relative gifting
of men and women. So, it is not just a positive commandment that impacts the
division of labor—a sufficient explanation in itself, but a divine diversity
that by complexification raises the potential for success and makes human
interaction more interesting and fulfilling at the same time. The Christian
response to differing gifts and roles is neither pride nor abasement, but
celebration and mutual appreciation, because the male cluster of strengths no
more correlates with superior worth than the female cluster correlates with
inferior worth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We might <b>(3)</b> <u>regard these
directives as generalities rather than absolutes</u>. A tendential present could
translate 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:12: <i>“I [tend] not to allow a woman to teach.”</i>
Such a rendering assumes that “man/husband” is not the common object of <i>“teach
or exercise authority over,”</i> because exercising authority over men/husbands
is elsewhere proscribed. Since male-female role relationship in the home cannot
be handled that way, however (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:3; Ephesians <b>5</b>:23),
it does not appear likely that we should understand Paul that way in church
matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In a statement like <i>“I do not allow a
woman . . .”</i> (1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:12) we might <b>(4)</b> <u>suppose that
the writer is being descriptive rather than prescriptive</u> (cp. 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:8;
1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:7-9, 12-40). He would be giving “advice” rather than “commandment.”
Commandment prescribes the one approach that arises from the nature of the case
and/or the authority of the Lord. Advice chooses one possibility because it
seems wisest under typical circumstances. Advice corresponds with the area in
wisdom that lies beyond law, wisdom being a larger category than <i>torah</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another way to put the idea is that Paul
states a personal preference based on, say, social propriety rather than a
theological mandate. We could read <i>“I do not allow a woman to teach or
exercise authority over a man”</i> (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:12) on the analogy of <i>“I
want younger widows to remarry”</i> (1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:14) or “<i>I would that
all men were like me”</i> (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:7). Paul uses similar
expressions, however, for matters other than personal preference. As to what is
lawful and what is expedient, he says, <i>“I will not be brought under the
power of any”</i> (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:12). Moreover, throughout his
discussion of various marital issues, he distinguishes between divine
revelation and personal preference or private judgment (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:1-40).
Even more to the point is the immediately preceding comment in 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:8,
<i>“So I want men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath and
disputing,”</i> obviously not a statement of personal preference (as to
holiness, wrath, and disputing, but not with holding up hands).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We could <b>(5) </b><u>suppose that Paul
meant 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:12 as a restraint on extremes rather than an outright
prohibition</u>, but that would not work with other comments about female deference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            More to the point in this document is
whether New Testament comments on male-female role relationships are
situational in a way that does not require compliance in modern cultures. Evangelicals
may <b>(7) </b><u>regard passages as situational in either a local or temporal
sense</u>. The idea is that Paul was dealing pastorally with first-century issues,
which called for incorporating an element of practicality into his directives. It
is not that he and other apostles failed to see the implicit contradiction
between fundamental principles and social evils (female subordination); they
did not want to throw unnecessary stumbling blocks in the way of the missionary
enterprise by introducing customs that would label them as social subversives. They
encouraged Christians to forgo personal rights for gospel progress (1 Corinthians
<b>9</b>:3-23). Paul’s handling of the slavery issue serves as an instructive
analogy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul was indeed concerned about the
impression Christian behavior might have on <u>non-Christians</u>. In reference
to the misuse of language speaking in Corinth, he did not want unbelievers to
think believers were crazy (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:23-25). In front of
unconverted Jews, Gentile Christians were to abstain not only from immorality,
but were to avoid transgressing certain ceremonial taboos as well (Acts <b>15</b>:19-21,
eating things strangled—and blood?). More related to our subject are Paul’s
comments that wives should defer to their husbands so God’s word would not be
blasphemed (Titus <b>2</b>:5) and that slaves should obey their masters so God’s
name and the teaching would not be blasphemed (1 Timothy <b>6</b>:1-2; cp. Romans<b>
2</b>:24). Peter admonished wives to respect their unconverted husbands to gain
them for Christ (1 Peter <b>3</b>:1-2, 5-6; cp. 1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:17?). Paul
circumcised Timothy to remove hindering his ministry (Acts. <b>16</b>:1). Concern
for adverse effect on <u>weaker Christians</u> was to guide Christian behavior
even on matters of opinion: shamble meat (1 Corinthians <b>8</b>; <b>10</b>:23-<b>11</b>:1),
unclean meat (Romans<b> 14</b>:14-15, 20-21), and wine (Romans <b>14</b>:21). For
this very reason, Paul earned his own living lest even <u>Christians</u> get
the impression that he was another sophist philosopher teaching for personal
gain (2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:13-18).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Particularly with 1 Timothy <b>2</b>, some
interpreters have suggested that Paul’s remarks were situational in that they
addressed a <u>local</u> problem. This passage is the clearest one that
specifically addresses the <u>church</u> situation as to women’s not teaching
and exercising authority, although in 1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34 Paul does talk
about women/wives being “quiet, or “giving deference,” in church assemblies. Other
passages address female deference in the <u>home</u> (Ephesians<b> 5</b>:21-33;
Colossians <b>3</b>:18-19; 1 Peter <b>3</b>:1-7). With 1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:9-15
could be removed from present-day application, it would enhance the case for
women serving in every church role.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We may infer from the following
considerations, however, that 1 Timothy <b>2</b> was not due to peculiar
circumstances in Ephesus. <b>(a)</b> 1 Timothy has several indicators that its
content did not represent local policy. <i>“I do not permit”</i> (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:15)
is itself a generality statement. In the same paragraph, people <i>“in every
place”</i> were to hold up holy hands (<b>2</b>:8). Later on in the letter, he
explains that he wrote in order to show (people/Timothy) how to conduct
themselves/himself in the church (<b>3</b>:14-15). Perhaps he wanted to provide
confirmation that Timothy was acting on Paul’s behalf in ordering the Ephesian
church according to “traditions” Paul himself had been following (cp. 1 Corinthians
<b>11</b>:2; 2 Thessalonians <b>2</b>:15; <b>3</b>:6). 1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:12 is
comparable to his practice of encouraging younger widows to remarry (<b>5</b>:14).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(b)</b> Paul’s letter to Titus (<b>1</b>:5)
lays down for churches in <u>Crete</u> teachings and procedures similar to
those in 1 and 2 Timothy, which were delivered to <u>Ephesus</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(c)</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> Several times Paul tells the Corinthians that his
policies were general ones: <i>“so I ordain in all the churches”</i> (1 Corinthians
</span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4</span></b><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>:17; </span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>:17; </span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>14</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>:33-34; </span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>16</span></b><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>:16;</span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> 14</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>:36). One of these policy statements deals with
male-female role relationship in the church. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(d)</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> Many New Testament documents circulated from the
first. Paul tells the Colossians to exchange letters with the Laodecians nearby
(Colossians<b> 4</b>:16). He did not consider that letter applicable to just
its original destination, which would be all the more so with pastoral letters.
Ephesians itself may have been an encyclical among the churches of Asia, and
might be that Laodicean letter under a different name. Galatians and Revelation
were designed for circulation. One explanation of the textual confusion in
Romans <b>15-16</b> has been that the epistle existed in more than one
recension, being used as a circulating treatise for didactic purposes. By the
time 2 Peter was written, the letters of Paul were known even in the provinces
of northern Asia Minor, where Paul himself had never evangelized (2 Peter<b> 3</b>:15-16;
Acts <b>16</b>:7). The general epistles as a group testify to the intentional
broad destination and distribution of New Testament writings (James; 1 &amp; 2
Peter; Jude). Even the little missive to Antioch from the conference on
circumcision was recopied and distributed among the Gentile churches during
Paul’s second tour (Acts <b>15</b>:15-29; <b>16</b>:4). With so much literary
circulation going on from the very inception of the Gentile mission, it is
hardly plausible to suggest that items of practical content were intended for
parochial use.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(e)</b> New Testament writers
understood that they were writing scripture (cp. 2 Peter <b>3</b>:15-16). New
Testament scripture naturally addresses the scope of the apostolic mission—all
people groups till the end of the age (cp. the principle of apostolicity in canonical
theory). Since apostolic writings were the functional equivalent of the
apostolic witness and authority, presumption argues against a culture-bound New
Testament. While not eliminating culturally referenced advice for original
audiences, such an observation hardly prepares us for assuming at every turn
that we are reading someone else’s mail on matters as basic as male-female
relationship. We expect culture-bound material to be at least recognizable for
what it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(f)</b> The kinds of reasons Paul gives
for male-female order in the church and the home are not localized reasons. They
are broader than what would apply just to Ephesus, Asia, or the Mediterranean
world of Jews or Gentiles: man’s being created before woman (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:13),
his being created in the image of God (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7),<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> the woman’s being created from
the man (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:8), her being created for him (1 Corinthians<b>
11</b>:9; Genesis <b>2</b>:18), the sequence of the fall (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:13),
Eve’s being deceived in the fall (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:14), woman’s being the
weaker vessel (1 Peter <b>3</b>:7), the husband’s being the head of the wife as
Christ is the head of the church (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:3; Ephesians <b>5</b>:23),
and agreement with the Law (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:34; Genesis<b> 3</b>:16?). At
least the historical and natural reasons in that list are not subject to the
place-time variable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For a control case, <b>(g)</b> readers
would like to see how Paul dealt with cases that <u>were</u> local
difficulties. As a matter of fact, we have no clear example of such a thing. In
one instance Paul strongly objected to a cultural-religious custom. The way he
handled circumcision is useful because it was ethnically limited, or “localized.”
Though circumcising Timothy to remove practical hindrances to Christian
ministry (Acts<b> 16</b>:1), Paul did not allow the Judaizers to force
circumcision on Gentiles for religious and national (which includes cultural)
reasons. In cases of personal preference, he labeled them as matters of opinion
and enjoined—yea, insisted on—tolerance: vegetarianism (Romans <b>14</b>:2-3),
special days (Romans <b>14</b>:5-6; contrast Colossians <b>2</b>:16-17). In
cases of custom, he dealt with them pragmatically without appealing to
theological, historical, or natural reasons; giving a daughter in marriage <i>vs</i>.
letting her give herself in marriage is an example (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:36-38).
In short, there is no case of using theological, natural, or historical
arguments in <i>post facto</i> fashion to enjoin an obvious matter of culture
or preference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            From a negative standpoint, <b>(h) </b>there
are no cues in the text that 1 Timothy<b> 2</b> addresses a local situation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(i)</b> The principle of female deference
appears in more than one author. While all the materials relevant to the <u>church</u>
setting come from Paul, in <u>household</u> teaching the principle of female deference
appears in Peter as well (cp. 1 Peter <b>3</b>:3-7). Church and home must
operate by compatible principles. So to speak, there cannot be a situation
where “the buck stops here” in the home and somewhere else in the church; the
two institutions cover the same full range of faith and practice and address
many of the same issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, <b>(j)</b> early Christian communities
were rather mobile. In Romans<b> 16</b> Paul greets twenty-six people he knew
before they moved to Rome. Phoebe was going to Rome from Cenchrea to work at
least for a while in some Christian endeavor. A large entourage of workers
traveled back and forth as part of the Pauline circle. With such an interchange
of both ministry and membership personnel, significant differences on something
as basic, important, and universal as male-female roles would have caused
considerable confusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            To show that a certain practice was
universal in the Christian community of the then-known world does not
necessarily show that it was meant to be permanent throughout history. That
raises the question of whether New Testament directives on male-female roles
were <u>temporary</u> because they were given within the implied limitation of
first-century Mediterranean culture. That possibility throws a different light
on wives deferring to husbands (Titus <b>2</b>:5) and slaves submitting to
masters (1 Timothy<b> 6</b>:1): both were to submit so the word of God would
not be blasphemed. Outside that first-century setting, wives not deferring to
husbands might no more cause non-Christians to blaspheme than slaves not
submitting to masters would. In that case, wives would not need to defer any
more than slaves would. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            However, enjoining deference to avoid
blasphemy is a different thing from enjoining deference <u>only</u> for that
reason. We have to ask whether other reasons are given for wives and slaves
submitting—reasons that lie in the nature of things, the theory of things, the
divine order of things, the purpose of things. Our observation is that the New
Testament gives no such reasons for slaves submitting. Slavery is dealt with <u>only</u>
in practical-pastoral terms (Ephesians <b>6</b>:5-9; 1 Timothy <b>6</b>:1-2). Paul
never says, for example, that the master is the head of the slave as Christ is
the head of the church. In fact, he apparently encourages slaves to gain their
freedom if they can (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:21).<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>5</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            But on female deference there are other
reasons given. As already noted, man was created before woman (1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:13);
man was created in the image of God (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7);<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1 </span>woman was created from man (1 Corinthians
<b>11</b>:8); she was created for man (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:9); man is the
head of woman as Christ is the head of the man and God is the head of Christ (1
Corinthians <b>11</b>:3); man is the head of woman in the sense that Christ is
the head of the church (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:3; Ephesians<b> 5</b>:23); Eve
was deceived but Adam was not (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:14),<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> and perhaps woman is the weaker vessel (1 Peter<b>
3</b>:7).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Like slavery, veil-wearing is often put
forward as a parallel with the first-century female deference principle. But
the custom of wearing a veil is not itself tied to historical, natural, or
theological reasons in the New Testament. It is tied to the female-deference
principle, which veil-wearing expressed<i>—“having authority on the head</i> [</span><span

than “not veil-wearing.” (It does not seem likely that “being contentious”
would be called a “custom,” or “practice,” a third option some commentators
like Grosheide here proposed.) We take it that veil-wearing was not itself a
custom of churches as such; it was not a Christian practice. So, the
Corinthians should not insist on veil-wearing to the point of causing
dissension in the church. (For additional comments on that context, see the
document entitled “1 Timothy <b>2</b>:9-15.”)<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>7</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We have noted the reasons for female deference
three times before. Some interpreters have taken at least some of them as <i>post
facto</i> reasons to reinforce merely practical directives. The sense in which
the reasons are reasons is an appropriate question to raise, but we need to
raise it in a way that it does not beg the question or call for a negative
burden of proof. In exegesis we should not let the unacceptableness of an idea
serve as a basis for making its stated reasons<i> post facto </i>and then
asking for proof that they are not <i>post facto</i>. There ought to be a
positive basis for reducing their value in that fashion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Although it is often not possible to
shoulder successfully the negative burden of proof, we may note the absence of
any clues in 1 Timothy <b>2</b> or elsewhere that reasons for female deference
were meant “after the fact.” For slavery, veil-wearing, dress code, and the
like, Paul does not give the kinds of reasons he gives for female deference,
nor does he use <i>post facto</i> reasons on these other matters. The manner of
handling Paul’s reasons is part of the descriptive <i>vs.</i> prescriptive
viewpoint itself addressed earlier; so, arguments given there against the
descriptive/personal-preference viewpoint also speak against seeing those
points as <i>post facto</i> reasons for it. 1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:8ff. has other
teachings that are not personal preference so as to be reinforced by
confirmatory evidence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, we wonder whether most reasons
given for most things could be handled as <i>post facto</i> reasons. Having
raised that control question, however, we may still ask how likely it is to
regard that way all the reasons listed under (f) above. Does not God’s creating
man first imply his <u>actually</u> ranking him first? Does not God’s creating
woman for man and from man provide <u>actual</u> reasons for believing that God
<u>did</u> give man primacy over woman in the final level of responsibility? Why
would God create man and woman in the sequence and format that he did and why
would the account of it say what it says except to communicate that very thing?
Even if Paul did appeal to these factors only as confirmatory reasons, would
they not, in fact, be primary ones? With no clue in the text of 1 Timothy <b>2</b>,
the reader has no reason to opt for a <i>post facto</i> status for these facts
except by the nature of the case, but the nature of the case cannot help the
proposal here, because the nature of the case is the point at issue. Unless
something favorable to the approach can be brought forward, we take the reasons
as actually <i>a priori</i> evidence for male-female role relationship in the
home and the church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Having come this far in the discussion, we
are left with one other proposal: the Genesis account is ahistorical, and the
text that reports occurrences there does not represent the actually happened.
It was put together by patriarchal writers in a patriarchal society as a way for
them to talk about a likely backstory. The “account” is etiological, informed
by current customs. The same mentality that Paul and Peter illustrate in their
directives was the mentality that originated the presentation in Genesis that
Paul draws on for his “reasons.” One is not a reason for the other; they are
simply alike, refer to each other, and are at best merely consistent. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In other words, to avoid the female
deference principle, we would be setting aside scripture as a reliable guide
for interpersonal behavior between people and between people and God as
reflected in the account of origins. We would be doing it to fit in with a contemporary
social consensus. But doing that removes the church’s prophetic role in society
and changes it into a reinforcing advocate of society’s intuitive inclinations.
To say anything pertinent to this last proposal, we must look at scripture’s
claims for itself and decide whether the phenomena fit the claims. (See essays about
scripture on this website to get started in that topic.) Meantime, adopting
such a viewpoint would remove us from having any basis for faith and practice
other than what society is willing to hear.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The appropriate conclusion seems to be that the texts
do not envision a local or temporary application in addressing female deference
in the home and the church. Much of the confusion in our contemporary setting
comes, not from some degrading implication in such an arrangement between the
sexes, but from misunderstanding what deference is, what formal Christian
leadership is to be like, and how the arrangement is modeled after Christ’s
loving relationship to the church. Correcting these confusions goes a long way
toward reducing the current controversy. For suggestions in that direction, see
our other documents on women’s studies, especially “Prolegomena to Men and Women
in Christ.”</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span>Paul
does not explain himself when he says that man <i>vs.</i> woman was created in
the image of God (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7). Whatever he means about man here
is not true of woman. His comment is surprising because everywhere else being
created in the image of God applies equally to men and women: Genesis<b> 1</b>:26-27;<b>
5</b>:1-3; <b>9</b>:5-6; James<b> 3</b>:9-10. The apostle could hardly be denying
such an obvious point. We understand <i>“the image of God”</i> and <i>“the
likeness of God”</i> as references to the interpersonal capacity, which both forms
of mankind share equally. Since in 1 Corinthians <b>11</b> Paul does not appeal
to the <u>sequence</u> of creation as a reason for female deference—as he does
in 1 Timothy <b><i>2</i></b>:13, perhaps he is playing on the fact that Adam
was <u>directly</u> created in God’s image while Eve was created in God’s image
by being created from Adam. She had the image by being created from Adam who
had it first, rather than by being created directly from nothing into God’s
image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            An added point may apply as well. One
implication of being in God’s image is having dominion over creation (Genesis <b>1</b>:26,
28; Psalm <b>8</b>). Again, that factor applies most originally to man because
he was created before woman and exercised that responsibility by naming the
animals before God created woman from him. As responsible being, mankind is
like God; in exercising that role before woman was formed, man was most like
God in the sense of responsibility. In saying that man <i>vs.</i> woman is in
the image of God, Paul presumably means it in the sense of directness (Eve
created from Adam) and degree (relative dominion, Adam created earlier). Furthermore,
scripture uniformly refers to God in masculine terms even though sexuality
cannot be the reason; so, more ultimate responsibility must again be the point.
Priority in time combined with woman’s being created from man implies his priority
in operational order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span>Another
aspect of the Genesis account may relate to male-female order even though no
New Testament writer appeals to it. Before the fall Adam called his wife “woman”
(cp. Genesis <b>3</b>:20). Naming implies something about relative order and
responsibility (cp. Genesis <b>2</b>:19-20).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span>“Positive
commandment” means enjoining one option when more than one could work. It
contrasts with “moral commandment,” which arises from the nature of the case as
the one way to act or at least the best one.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span>One
problem many middle-aged feminists face is the realization that they cannot “have
it all.” Originally, they were told that they could have a career right
alongside the men and have a family too. Many of them did not marry, many who
married did not have children, and now it is getting too late to experience the
good things that come from having a home, and they feel cheated. A woman cannot
work eight to ten hours a day and still have enough physical and emotional
energy to give primary attention to children. Men cannot do it either. Who then
is left to take care of that important task? Children are the ones who end up
suffering for the misguided energies of adults.</span></p>

last reason is difficult to assess because Paul does not explain the connection
with his subject. Presumably he does not mean that all women are “punished” for
Eve’s sin. More likely, her being deceived reflects something in her nature—some
tendency that Satan took advantage of in taking advantage of her. What that
tendency might be is experientially and experimentally hard to get at either by
male or female “researchers.” Neither of them can easily get outside their own
subjectivity and sexuality in designing experiments and interpreting data. Could
it be that women do have a greater tendency to trust, which the unscrupulous
can exploit? If being deceived connects with “weaker vessel,” could it relate
to a woman’s greater sense of vulnerability, hence, being more prone to believe
suggestions about deprivation and exploitation? Is there some truth to the
notion that women are more affectively and intuitively driven, and that such a
trait, healthy in itself, predisposes them to certain kinds of mistakes that
need to be minimized in religious leaders, especially in the teaching and
ruling ministry? Could having a more affective-intuitive orientation relate to
Paul’s not wanting women officially “teaching” (<i>vs.</i> prophesying) because
the exegetical process calls for a more rational orientation than a tendency to
respond to one’s “sense” of things? These questions seem to be the right kind
to ask regardless of how confident we feel about answering them. Werner Neuer’s
<i>Man &amp; Woman in Christian Perspective</i> provides a helpful entry into
considerations of male-female differences.</span></p>
