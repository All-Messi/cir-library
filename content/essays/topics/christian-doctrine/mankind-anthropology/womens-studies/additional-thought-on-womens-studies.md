<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some additional questions arise from
previous presentations on women’s studies. For one thing, I have used “ministry”
in the title of a paper that centered on leadership in relation to women's
roles. “Ministry” is broader than leadership, but leadership is the area in
which disagreement about women's roles has arisen. One way to help resolve
controversial issues is to appeal to the larger category in which they stand. A
<u>title</u> about “ministry” is useful on this subject because women are
clearly free to make significant contributions to kingdom work; the question is
whether they are free to make contributions in formal leadership ministry over
men. Ministry as the larger category sets the context for leadership ministry. Any
distinctive elements in the latter must be added in such a way as not to
contradict the larger framework. The thesis in “Ministry Before Consensus” has been
that we can carry forward the kingdom's work significantly and with minimal
negatives even before we resolve the problem. We can do that <u>if</u> we keep
the problem clearly defined, <u>if</u> we keep it from spilling over into
foreign issues, and <u>if</u> we maintain a proper understanding of Christian
leadership. <u>Women's</u> formal and informal Christian leadership ministry
needs to conform to Christian leadership ministry generally, Christian <u>leadership</u>
ministry needs to take place in a way that harmonizes with Christian <u>ministry</u>,
and Christian ministry of every sort must retain the characteristics of
interpersonal process. Since it is ministry that we want to get done, ministry
is the subject area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A related question is whether “ministry of
Christians in the church (men or women) can be considered apart from leadership
issues.” Some ministry is neither informal or formal <u>leadership</u>, but
again that is not the kind of ministry women's roles </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><img width=435 height=264

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>raises questions about.  Furthermore, <u>informal</u> leadership,
which is through influence alone, is also not part of the current issue—or at
least ought not be; everyone should influence people for Christ in whatever
ways he can, both inside and outside the church community. The issue is whether
the New Testament restricts women from serving in ultimate <u>formal</u>
leadership roles that have supervisory authority over <u>men</u>; should women
teach or lead “offic-ially”? We cannot consider ministry apart from leadership
issues, because the area of disagreement is about women's exercising formal
leadership over men. Minimizing that difficulty can come from a proper
understanding of Christian leadership and other more basic relevant categories.
The values and characteristics of those basic categories are retained in the
more specialized ones. If we practice the more fundamental issues correctly, we
avoid much of whatever danger could come from wrong conclusions about the most
specialized area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The previous paragraph assumes a view of
leadership ministry that retains supervisory authority in some places. To avoid
excesses and misuses of authority, some have tried to eradicate authority from
church structure altogether. Despite the claim that no authority exists in the
church (<u>Christ</u> has been given all the authority in heaven and on earth),
these interpreters do not in fact operate without using authority; they simply
emphasize cooperation and consensus. Their idea seemingly works only because
good leaders who have authority do most of their leading without it; they lead
by influence most of the time. The result feels like cooperation, as it should;
but the responsibility and right to decide nevertheless exists, and is called
upon from time to time when influence does not suffice for practical reasons. Instead
of discarding authority because of its abuses, we do better to stress
responsibility, understanding that authority comes into the picture only to reinforce
responsibility. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We may add the fact that the church is a
voluntary society; if authority becomes <i>“lording it over the flock,”</i>
people just leave. That practical fact impacts the extent to which authority
plays its role in the body of Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A question also arises as to why 1 Timothy
<b>2 </b>was <i>“<u>the</u> one New Testament text”</i> used in the paper as
the base for <i>&quot;the major generalization about women's work in the
church.&quot;</i> The reason for referring to that context was not so much that
it is the only one relevant to the issue of men-women relationship in <u>church
roles</u> (<i>vs</i>. home roles), but because in it is the fullest, clearest,
and apparently most straightforward one on that topic. Even if it were the only
one that touched on the question, it we would still need to hear it, because we
take a view of scripture (and apostolicity in canonicity) that guarantees the
propriety of apostolic directives aside from any <u>number-of-references</u>
consideration. Again, in accordance with the view of scripture assumed in these
studies, a <u>harmony of viewpoint within the subject area</u> was assumed
across the texts that in various ways relate to men-women relationship
generally. This observation tends to balance the presentation and thereby avoid
extremes by listing the religious (and non-religious) activities we know biblical
women did; these other texts are among “the other many texts” relevant to the
women's-roles question. Galatians <b>3</b>:28 and other <u>texts on related
topics</u> are not dealt with individually because of space and time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As regards related topics, I have supposed
that a timeless pragmatic variable harmonizes <u>man-woman equality</u> as per
Galatians <b>3</b>:28 (theoretical) with <u>role-emphasis diversity</u> as per
1 Timothy <b>2</b> (practical); role assignments for men and women correlate
with the relative gifting of men and woman (nature), that relative gifting
being statistical by degree more than kind. Furthermore, the structure of the
church should mesh with the structure of the home. (Besides <i>topics </i>related
to men-women relationships, we should look at <i>consistency in reasoning</i> on
subjects we consider cultural issues: slavery, veil-wearing, and the like.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In addition to a difference based on <b>(a)
</b>assumed relative gifting, opting for <u>divine role assignment</u> rather
than <u>situational directive</u> depends in part on <b>(b)</b> the kinds of
reasons texts give: Adam was first formed, then Eve (1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:13);
Eve was deceived, but Adam was not (1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:14); the woman is the
weaker vessel (1 Peter <b>3</b>:7); Adam was created (more directly?) in the
image of God (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7). These reasons are rooted in history
and nature, which do not change with time and place. Admittedly the texts do
not say explicitly why these reasons are reasons or in what way they belong to
the subject. They could be <i>post facto</i> rather than <i>a priori </i>reasons.
In some cases, they could be reasons for the basic principle—female submission—rather
than reasons for the cultural manner of signaling that principle. The latter
does seem to be the point of Paul's argument for veil-wearing in 1 Corinthians<b>
11</b> (cp. the document “1 Timothy <b>2</b>:9-12,” p. 1). It might apply also
to <i>&quot;teaching</i>,<i>&quot; </i>because cultures can regard teachers and
teaching differently. Women's teaching in 1 Timothy <b>2</b> does not seem to
be explained this way, because their “teaching” is approved in other
circumstances. Teaching or not teaching, then, is referenced to differences of
circumstance or nature of teaching within the circumstances rather than
referenced to the setting/culture itself. Since Paul combines his prohibition
with “ruling” men, since he is moving into eldership characteristics, and since
teaching and ruling are the two distinctive responsibilities of elders, Paul
evidently means that he did not let women do normative, authoritative, or
official teaching. Paul's not letting <i>women exercise authority over men </i>(1
Timothy <b>2</b>:12) could likewise not explain a difference between
fundamental principle and the cultural manner of signaling that principle. The underlying
principle would be female deference, which is the same thing as not exercising
authority over men. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another consideration is an additional
level in the practical application of the female deference principle: whether a
culture considers teaching an authoritative function aside from the manner in
which a woman carries herself in a teaching endeavor. It also relates to how
the teaching situation proceeds: a discussion leader is different from a
directive presenter.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Thirdly, opting for some gender-referenced
role assignments depends on <b>(c)</b> certain accompanying features of the
texts. In another document (“1 Timothy <b>2</b>:9-15: Situational or General?”),
I have assembled factors that seem to indicate that Paul's comments are not
meant in a localized or temporary sense. So, his comments in 1 Timothy were not
distinctive for Ephesus or for the first century.</span></p>
