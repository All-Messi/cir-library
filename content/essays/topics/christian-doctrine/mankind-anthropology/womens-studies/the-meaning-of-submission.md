<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As with other controversial matters, the
biblical view of marriage and the family gets lost in the throes of pendulum
thinking. Truth tends to lie between extremes, but on this issue unnecessary
rigidness creates an extreme opposite and equal reaction. After a while,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>discussions on headship and submission get lost in a
battle between those extremes and lose sight of the proper orientation for the
subject. Emotions take over on one side, which wants to defend the accuracy of
scripture in all matters whereof it speaks. The other side wants to breathe
some fresh air of freedom for women and their service in the kingdom. Whenever
something comes up that seems to foster one extreme, people on the other
extreme react. As a result, discussion does not resolve the issue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Pendulum effects are like reverse
Hegelianism. Hegelianism pictures processes of change where one view (“thesis”)
creates an opposing view (“antithesis”), and over time the two compromise by
including elements from the original extremes (“synthesis”). The pendulum
effect turns that format around by taking what looks like a synthesis and
moving to one side of norm, which stimulates reaction too far to the other
side. </span></p>

Responsibility </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The point about headship-deference in
marriage is this: headship means final <u>responsibility</u> in the home;
hence, submission means acting in ways appropriate to a husband’s final
responsibility for the purpose, welfare, security, and orderliness of the
family. Because <i>submission </i>has come to connote acquiescing to dominance,
we have substituted <i>deference</i> as a more correct expression of what
characterizes people’s response to others who have final responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. <u>Deference in marriage takes place in
the context of personal relationship characteristics</u> because marriage
belongs in the interpersonal category. Any setting that involves people falls
within the personal framework. Distinctives of that setting add to the original
framework without contradicting it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Deference does not bypass or
stifle personhood. The difference Christianity makes on leading has a
corresponding difference on following. The kind of leading scripture talks
about does not depersonalize followers. When followers follow, leaders can lead
interpersonally instead of authoritatively, which means that the followers are
not so much followers as associates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. <u>Marital deference stands in the
context of Christian leadership theory generally</u>. Marriage, parenting, and
eldership are different circumstances of Christian leadership. Whatever we say
about one of them must fit with what we say about Christian leadership
generally and about personal relationship, because Christian leadership takes
place in the context of persons. Leadership theory must fit the nature of
persons because persons are the ones leading and being led. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                      We
enhance the understanding of the hierarchical aspect of marriage if we remember
the typical things said about leadership in general. <b>(a) </b>Leadership is
earned before it is given. That is one thing courtship is for—earning respect. Marriage
then gives that leadership. <b>(b)</b> Leadership operates through <u>personal
influence</u> before <u>legal authority</u> (or <u>physical force</u> in cases
like a police force and national defense). Christian leaders do as much as
possible through the first before invoking the second.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        3. <u>The distinctive factor
in leadership is responsibility</u>. Authority comes into the picture only to
reinforce responsibility already given. Husbands are examples of servant-leaders:
(a) they serve God above in leading those “below” to fulfill the purposes God has
given the group. (b) A servant-leader is likewise a servant to those “below” to
accomplish what is for their welfare (cp. Hebrews<b> 13</b>:17 re elders).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In marriage as well as in any other situation
with leadership, there is no need to invoke authority except (1) <u>on points
that impact responsibility</u>. Even then, authority is invoked only (2) <u>as
a backup when for some reason influence is not sufficient to achieve the required
results</u>. Leadership and personal relationship are identical until influence
is not enough. That is why leadership takes place even outside of leadership “positions.”
In such cases, we call it “natural leadership” (<i>vs</i>. formal leadership). Furthermore,
the social context requires invoking authority (3) <u>in a manner that does not
contradict the personal context</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Deference</u> and <u>headship</u> are
correlative terms; they fall within a common larger category. The meaning of
the first is implied by the meaning of the second and <i>vice versa</i>. To understand
deference requires understanding headship. Since headship means responsibility,
deference means cooperating with responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the husband-wife relationship, because
of the husband’s responsibility, the wife defers beyond what love already calls
for mutually. Certain behaviors characterize that recognition. She does not
pressure him into doing her bidding. She does not establish domicile when it is
his responsibility to find work and provide for her and the children. On
sensitive matters that affect them conjointly, she does not speak on her own
outside the home or in front of the children. Beyond ways of acting that derive
from personal relationship itself, any action is acceptable that fits with his
final responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                                                                      As
an added note on the connotation of “submit,” we note Paul’s comment to the
Corinthians about the household of Stephanas that had devoted themselves to
ministering to the saints, <i>“I urge you . . . to submit to such<sup>mas </sup>and
to everyone<sup>mas</sup> that helps and labors.” </i>The context does not indicate
that Stephanas was an elder in Corinth—which is possible, but Paul’s urging has
to do with the household, a larger entity that reminds us of Isaiah’s wife as
“prophetess.” In addition, Paul broadens the application to anyone that labors
for the Lord, which introduces unofficial service into the scope of his reference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            I. Headship as responsibility in an
interpersonal setting shows how hierarchical (<i>vs</i>.
egalitarian/equalitarian) marriage has nothing to do with the foreign items
often mixed into the picture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        A. In regard to <u>decision-making</u>,
responsibility does not eliminate a wife’s input, especially on matters that
affect her, and most things affect her. It does not mean <b>(1) </b>making all
final decisions or <b>(2)</b> making them to the husband’s preferences. Paul’s
leadership as an apostle was not compromised because Apollos did not want to go
to Corinth when Paul wrote his first epistle to that city (1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:12).
Responsibility does not suggest a husband’s <b>(3) </b>being in on every
decision. Healthy marriages work out procedures the partners agree on, and both
proceed with these principles without redeliberation. If headship does not
involve these things, neither does deference. These points come from good
leadership style. Not allowing input, <i>etc</i>., illustrates immaturity in
headship, not headship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        B. Deference does not mean
having a submissive <u>personality</u>. It does not mean that a wife cannot be
an extrovert. It does not take away any effervescence natural to her. It means only
that she does not run out ahead or try to take over in her outgoing tendency. Who
does the most talking is a function of personality and verbal ability, not an
indication of leadership. Not the amount of verbalizing, but the “weight” of it,
is what demonstrates leadership. Weight comes from the power of ideas and
placement of responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        C. Headship and deference do
not imply anything about <u>ability</u>, intelligence, and so on. Although
scripture seems not to address the point, interpreters often suppose that God
has gifted men and women in ways that correspond more closely with their
overlapping responsibilities. The configuration of gifts and the differing
degrees of shared gifts—which include most abilities—best equip men and women
for their complementing roles. The <u>distinctive</u> emphasis of wife’s roles grows
out of childrearing (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:15). The <u>distinctive</u> emphasis of
husband’s roles taking final responsibility for family needs like provisions
and security (1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:8). The two roles are overlapping,
corresponding gifting is by degree, and differences are statistical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Scripture gives reasons for its directives
on husband-wife relations: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        1.   in the creation man was
first formed, then Eve (1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:13); </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        2.   in the fall, the woman
was deceived but the man was not (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:14); </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        3.   woman was created from
man (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:8, 12a); </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        4.   woman was created for man
(1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:9); </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        5.   man is by woman (1
Corinthians <b>11</b>:12b); and </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        6.   women are weaker (evidently
in a physical sense; 1 Peter<b> 3</b>:7). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The reasons are historical and constitutional, but New
Testament writers do not spell out why historical reasons are, in fact, reasons
or how the gifts of men and women differ to give rationale for a husband’s final
responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            D. Deference does not eliminate a wife’s <u>thinking</u>
for herself. The teaching about headship does not remove anyone’s moral and
religious self-responsibility. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            E. Deference is not a <u>feeling</u>. Deference
does not feel like deference when headship flows from love. It seems little different
from the relationship in which it occurs. It “feels like” cooperation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One problem in this subject lies in
English vocabulary. <i>Submission</i> has come to connote “submissiveness,”
which conjures up passive personality and low self-esteem. That is foreign to
most women’s personalities and rightly so. “Submit” implies obedience under
duress, one not born of free will. The fact that submission is commanded and
that it is a matter of <i>“submitting yourselves”</i> (Ephesians <b>5</b>:21)
combine with the nature of proper leadership to eliminate any authoritarian element.
Because of the connotation of “submit,” we have used <i>defer</i> for translating
</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὑποτάσσομαι</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<i>hypotassomai</i>). <i>Fear</i> translates </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>φόβος</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<i>phobos</i>).
In social contexts, <i>respect</i> better expresses our attitude toward Christ (Ephesians<b>
5</b>:21, <i>e.g</i>.) and a wife’s attitude toward her husband (Ephesians<b> 5</b>:33).
It means respect for another’s worth and responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            F. Similarly, deference has nothing to do
with <u>worth</u> or anything that affects self-esteem. Self-worth derives from
interpersonal matters, not from status—from self-giving<i> vs</i>. competition.
Deference is for a purpose, not a person; deference does not comment on the
worth of the one deferring or the one deferred to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            G. Deference comes from the <u>motivation</u>
of respecting the fact that the other has a job to do. It compares favorably
with the Hebrew writer’s admonition that his readers should obey their “rulers”
in the church because those leaders must give account (<b>13</b>:17). Deference
does not imply insincere cooperation to curry favor or appease power. That
false view of submission corresponds with a false understanding of headship; it
fails to make personal relationship the permeating factor. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            II. Headship as responsibility in an
interpersonal setting means that most things in marriage are not matters of
leadership but of cooperation, preference, personality, expediency, and love. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The first thing in marriage, parenting,
and eldership is not authority, but caring, because the first thing is personal
relationship. Headship as responsibility in the context of love means letting love
accomplish first as much as it can. At this level, marriage <u>is</u>
equalitarian/egalitarian because most things in a marriage do not call for “leadership.”
That is why equalitarian marriage sounds plausible, especially in contrast to
abuses of headship, which are too common. Equalitarianism—at least
interpersonal equalitarianism—embodies an important truth: love governs
marriage like it governed courtship. It embodies an important half-truth,
however, because there is more to <u>marriage</u> than <u>personal relationship
</u>and certainly more than <u>sheer individualism</u>. Especially when
children come into the home, family theory must suffice for <u>family,</u> and
in some societies that goes beyond nuclear family to <u>extended family</u>. As
the size of any group increases, complexity increases, and the need for some structure
likewise increases. As long as a couple does not have children, the emphasis on
headship is relatively low; love and influence take care of most everyday matters.
Division of labor and sex-related roles come into operation more when husband
and wife have children to care for. New Testament teaching about marriage and
the home is calculated to guide complex family settings as well as the simple
ones. </span></p>
