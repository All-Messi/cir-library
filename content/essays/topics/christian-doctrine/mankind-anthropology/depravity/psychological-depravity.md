<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In many cases, opposing
natural depravity amounts to opposing natural determinism,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> that is, a determinism based in
mankind’s substantive nature itself. On a strict Augustinian model, natural
depravity creates a determinism from within due to <u>disordered nature</u>.
Its remedy must come by miraculously reordering the corrupt nature so that the
person who <u>could not</u> respond before <u>must</u> respond now. The
objection has been that this construct cannot resolve the Great Dilemma because
it puts within God the variable between “the all” God desires to save and “the
some” he decides to save.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Systematically speaking,
Augustine did not have to make regenerating grace such that the recipient must
respond. He did not have to consider it effectual; he could have considered it
effective. “Effectual,” or efficacious, guarantees the result while “effective”
tends toward it. The remedy needs only to reorder to the point of <u>potential
response</u>. By unnecessarily carrying it to <u>necessary response</u>,
Augustine demonstrated his supposition that obedience before justification
would be merit. A false presupposition about the nature of salvation created—or
at least correlated with—an error in his understanding of the nature of man. Merit
is not <u>doing the action</u> ourselves, but <u>achieving the result</u>
ourselves. The latter is what is not possible. God gives the result, not the
action, the ability to do the action, or the necessity of doing the action. The
essential error of Augustine’s earlier answer to Mani regarding the <u>source</u>
of sin becomes clear in his later answer to Pelagius regarding the <u>solution</u>
to sin. “Depravitizing” human nature unnecessarily adds to the causes of sin
because “undepravitizing” human nature becomes unnecessary for avoiding merit. Sin
and evil are <u>disconformity</u>, not <u>privation</u>, because sin must
involve a relational element.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Functional determinism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            To explain the first Great
Awakening from a Calvinistic perspective, Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) moved
toward what can be called “functional determinism.” The Edwardsian model
created a double source of determinism—a determinism from within due to <u>weak
nature</u> (more than disordered nature) and a determinism from without due to <u>strengthened
stimulus</u> (more than miraculous reorganization of the nature itself).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Under either model, however,
no choice appears <u>between</u> good and evil, but only the result of being
able to respond to the one good alternative to which God draws the individual. Both
Augustine’s and Edwards’ constructs give <u>freedom to choose for</u> good
works, but not a prior choice of <u>freedom to choose between</u> good and evil
works.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2 </span>Advocating choice
between good and evil does not suggest that doing the one is necessarily as
easy as doing the other. The causes for universal sinfulness apply equally to
the origin and continuation of each person’s sin.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'> </span>The contention is, however, that these causes do not
essentially differ between the unsaved and the saved. Having no concept of
choice <u>between</u> good and evil, necessarily corresponds with the doctrine
of particularism; otherwise, those for whom redemption was accomplished would
not necessarily equal those to whom it is applied. Edwards’ stimulus-response
construct does not meet the criterion of the Great Dilemma any more than
Augustine’s model did. In both cases, the variable that would solve the Dilemma
ends up in God, which makes him inconsistent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Saying that the variable
lies within us means that stimulus does not necessarily equal response. <u>More
stupendous evidence does not necessarily create more desirable results</u>.  This
idea is implicit in the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke <b>16</b>:19-31).
The request to have someone go back to five living brothers is answered, <i>“They
have Moses and the prophets to hear.” </i>The rich man argues that his brothers
would repent if someone went to them from the dead, but Abraham observes that
unwillingness to hear the former predicts refusal to hear the latter. More
stupendous display of evidence does not necessarily correspond with greater
likelihood of repentance. Avoiding <u>sufficient evidence</u> exhibits the same
mentality as evading <u>stupendous evidence</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Notes to this same effect
occur also in Matthew <b>11</b>:20-24; Mark <b>6</b>:1-6; Luke <b>10</b>:12-16;
and John <b>12</b>:37. The Jewish leaders had ideological reasons for not
accepting Jesus’ claims, teachings, and deeds. The Pharisees were attempting to
apply the doctrinal test of Deuteronomy <b>13</b>:1-5 without questioning
whether they understood the doctrines (John <b>7</b>:40-41). Their refusal to
reconsider their beliefs illustrates the pride that lies at the heart of sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>More stupendous love
tends to create more desirable results</u>. When Jesus was anointed by the
sinful woman, he enunciated the principle that the one forgiven the most loves
the most (Luke <b>7</b>:43, 47). An inverse proportion may exist between the
degree of entrenchment in sin and the degree of response to sanctification. On
the one hand, the greater the forgiveness the greater the responding love. On
the other hand, the extent of entrenchment in sin does not correspond with the
extent of overcoming it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Laying out an overall
framework eliminates parallel possibilities, but it does not positively arrange
the internal structure. Eliminating natural depravity avoids the Great Dilemma
because a man can at least respond to external influence. The task changes here
from biblical to speculative theology, specifically to formulating a hypothesis
about the mechanisms for discontinuity between stimulus and response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(1)</b> <u>On the
response side</u>, we may posit a lack of correspondence due to the power of
imagination and related concepts like self-transcendence, the tacit dimension,
penetration of a situation in thought, and creative ability. What issues in
behavior does not equal exactly what enters as stimulus and influence. The mind
transforms perception into conception because the rational power of imagination
formally manipulates experience by recombination, negation, subtraction, misperception,
and the like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Behavior comes, then, not
from reality itself but from perceived reality. Even more exactly, behavior
comes not from sheer perception, but from processed perception. Speaking this
way assumes <b>(a) </b>that the internal structures of the mind and external
structures of the world sufficiently harmonize and correlate for practical
purposes. It assumes <b>(b)</b> that the structures of the one do not come from
the other, but derive from a common origin in the creator of both. Finally, it
assumes that <b>(c) </b>persons come equipped with the forms of rationality to
which experience gives content.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3 </span>Limited
experience necessitates imagination. For example, in conceptualizing the total
flow of reality from limited perception, a person might imagine that a
seemingly straight line is in fact part of a very large circle. On the other
hand, he might imagine that the observed revolutions of life are actually
spiraling upward or moving toward a goal like a wheel rolling down the road. Concepts
like these may in turn impact behavior. Experience is active rather than
passive action; it involves creativity as well as reception. The rational power
of imagination adds to what it receives to produce the completed conception. Behavior
issues not so much from <u>per</u>ception of reality as from <u>con</u>ception
of reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(2)</b> <u>On the
stimulus side</u>, the inherent power of the Christian message does not depend
on the quality and intensity of the presentation. Response may have greater or
lesser intensity than the presentation had. Much of the inherent power of
Christianity lies in its correspondence with the actual needs of man—a
correspondence intuitively recognizable on the rational principle of
correlation. Amid alternative influences, persons tend to choose what best
correlates with their perceived needs. The faith of the Christian is that the
Christian faith is best suited to mankind’s real needs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Mankind has culture in place
of instinct. His acts come more from teaching than from heredity.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4 </span>The influence of an idea taught
by a person does not evoke so necessary a response as a physical stimulus does.
The Christian faith calls people to live by values instead of impulses, drives,
and stimuli. <i>“The unreasoned life is not worth living.”</i> Authentic
existence means living by transcendent values. Though spiritual values and
physical stimuli may both come under the term <i>stimulus</i>, the rational
power of <u>con</u>ception must be distinguished from the sensory power of <u>per</u>ception.
<u>Con</u>ception enables persons to live by transcendent values even in the
face of contrary imminent stimuli. As a result, persons do not have to live in
an Edwardsian stimulus-response determinism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Practical determinism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is also a practical
determinism in the case of those who have had no real opportunity to hear the
gospel unto salvation. One encompassing principle applies to this matter of
opportunity: <u>inequities during the time of proclamation are gathered up at
the time of judgment</u>. They are not determined during the process, but
adjusted for after it. Under the natural depravity concept, for there to be any
salvation at all, a preliminary operation of God must take place during the
time of proclamation. At that time the issues are essentially decided by virtue
of whom God enables. But if supernatural enablement does not have to occur, God
maintains his self-consistency; and in his wisdom he can evaluate inequities in
<b>(a)</b> the degree of sin pressure and in <b>(b) </b>the quality of gospel
exposure. Subsequent judgment takes into consideration qualifying features
during proclamation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In Romans <b>2</b>:12-16
Paul offers a positive framework for those outside special revelation. Paul
included the Gentiles in his argument from history, experience, and scripture
that all men are lost. The inference seems clear that in principle those
evaluated by conscience are under the perfection construct as surely as those
under law. They are both under an absolute standard of expectancy. The process
of judgment stays the same, but the basis changes. God renders judgment on the
basis of conscience (<b>2</b>:14-15) and law—or <u>gospel</u> (<b>2</b>:16),
even though sins of ignorance he can overlook or not impute (<b>3</b>:25; cp. 1
Timothy <b>1</b>:13; Acts <b>17</b>:30; <b>14</b>:16?). Since Romans <b>2</b>:14-16
connects conscience and law, the passage evidently teaches that judgment
applies to that area in which conscience properly leads. Since no one
consistently lives up to his conscience, he becomes as surely imperfect
relative to conscience as Jews became imperfect relative to special revelation.
The possibility of a Gentile’s being saved through Christ without hearing of
him seems as realistic as a Jew’s being saved through Christ before he came.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sliding-scale judgment does
not exhibit an evaluative determinism where everyone comes out the same. Paul’s
comments about the Gentiles represents God as conducting his judgment in this
manner. Sliding-scale judgment is also evident in comments about degrees of
punishment and reward: <i><u>“more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah”</u> </i>(Matthew
<b>10</b>:15; <b>11</b>:22; Luke <b>10</b>:24); <i>“the first will be last and
the last first”</i> (Matthew<b> 19</b>:30;<b> 20</b>:16; Mark <b>10</b>:31;
Luke <b>13</b>:30); <i>“twofold more the child of hell than yourselves”</i>
(Matthew <b>23</b>:15); <i>“better not to have known”</i> (2 Peter <b>2</b>:20-22);
<i>“many and few stripes”</i> (Luke <b>12</b>:47-48a); <i>“receive the greater
condemnation”</i> (Mark <b>12</b>:40; Luke <b>20</b>:47); <i>“she did what she
could”</i> (Mark <b>14</b>:8); <i>“to whom much is given much will be required”</i>
(Luke <b>12</b>:48b); <i>“he has the greater sin”</i> (John<b> 19</b>:11); <i>“the
right hand and left hand in the kingdom” </i>(Matthew <b>19</b>:28; <b>20</b>:21-23;
Mark <b>10</b>:36-40). The rewards of divine fellowship come in the form of
varying responsibilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Any form of absolute
determinism contradicts the implication of the Great Dilemma. The rational
power of imagination, the inherent power of the message, and sliding-scale
judgment bring modifying factors into the salvation process that help avoid
determinism. There is an environmental and hereditary component to all
behavior, but factors that we cannot control fall out of the judgment process. The
ones we can affect form the basis for evaluation. On the one hand, influence is
necessary and effective, because we will not change without it. On the other
hand, we can change when the influence comes, and the change is not necessarily
commensurate with the influence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Avoiding determinism must
preserve influence so ability to resist must allow tendency to respond. Interpersonal
love seems to meet these specifications. In the conquest of sin, if we succeed,
God gets the credit; if we fail, we take the blame. The situation is comparable
to a husband that overcomes alcoholism through the influence of his wife. He
might say, <i>“She made a new man out of me,”</i> even though <u>he</u> did the
“making.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Avoiding determinism must
also preserve a difference between the pre-Christian and Christian states since
becoming a Christian means receiving the Spirit who gives strength. At the <u>corporate
level</u>, the Spirit give <b>(a)</b> unity to Christian people (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>;
Ephesians <b>4</b>:3). At the <u>individual level</u>, he not only gives <b>(b)</b>
guidance as to what we are to do (Galatians <b>5</b>:25; cp. <b>5</b>:18, 17;
Romans <b>8</b>:14) and <b>(c)</b> strengthens us to do it (Ephesians <b>3</b>:16),
but also (d) intercedes for us when we fail to do it (Romans <b>8</b>:16,
26-27; Ephesians <b>2</b>:18; John 1<b>4</b>:16, 26; <b>15</b>:26; <b>16</b>:17).
<u>Before salvation</u> the previous dispensations of God’s love draw us to him.
<u>After salvation</u> the sense of present acceptance moves us to greater
triumphs in holy living than would be possible standing alone and lonely.</span></p>

through <b>(a)</b> <u>hearing the message about Christ</u> (Romans <b>10</b>:17).
Hearing may not always produce or enhance faith, but faith always comes from
hearing, as experience shows. The <u>content</u> of God’s purpose and pattern
for human life are found principally in the message that comes from the
outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <u>motivation</u> to
conform to God’s purpose and pattern for human life is found in the other three
elements of the process. Whereas the <u>cognitive</u> predominates in the
Christian message, the <u>affective</u> predominates in the rest, particularly
in <b>(b) </b><u>experiencing relationship with fellow Christians</u>. We feel God’s
love through the love of God’s people so that God has assigned a most
significant role to the church as a community that builds itself up in love
(Ephesians <b>4</b>:6). In New Testament literature, edification always appears
in connection with the body of Christ and the atmosphere of love (Romans<b> 12</b>;
<b>14</b>; 1 Corinthians <b>8</b>; 12-14; 1 Thessalonians <b>5</b>:12-22; the
Johannine literature throughout).</span></p>

dependence in a circumstance we cannot cope with, alter, or manage alone.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5 </span>Under the confidence that God
will not let come on us more than we can handle (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:13), several
benefits accrue to us when we successfully confront hardship and temptation. We
learn obedience (Psalm<b> 119</b>:67), respect (Hebrews <b>12</b>:9), proper
ranking of priorities (Romans <b>8</b>:18); psychological, or spiritual,
strength (2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:10; 1 Peter <b>5</b>:10), humility (2
Corinthians <b>12</b>:7-9), ability to empathize with other people (2
Corinthians <b>1</b>:4-5; <b>11</b>:23-29; Hebrews<b> 2</b>:18; <b>10</b>:34),
patience (2 Corinthians <b>1</b>:6; James <b>5</b>:10-11; 1 Peter <b>2</b>:20;
Revelation<b> 13</b>:10; <b>14</b>:12), and boldness (1 Thessalonians <b>2</b>:2;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, <b>(d)</b> for <u>a
Christian, guidance, power, and intercession come from sharing an I-You
association with the Spirit</u>. On the human side, is a psychological
depravity with the power of sin as the power of habit and faith as a natural
response rather than supernatural deposit. On the Holy Spirit side, is a person
rather than a power, principle, feeling, or attitude. <u>He does what persons
do in that he thinks</u> (Acts <b>15</b>:28), loves (Romans <b>15</b>:30), and
communicates (John <b>14</b>:26; <b>15:</b>26; Romans <b>8</b>:26; 1 Timothy <b>4</b>:1).
<u>He is treated like a person</u> in that he may be blasphemed (Matthew <b>12</b>:31),
lied to (Acts<b> 5</b>:3), tempted (Acts <b>5</b>:9), resisted (Acts <b>7</b>:51),
grieved (Ephesians <b>4</b>:30), and insulted (Hebrews <b>10</b>:29). The we-Spirit
relationship is an interpersonal relationship between us who have ability and
the Holy Spirit who sheds influence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Combined interaction of
components</u>. Three aspects comprise the sanctification process:<b> (a)</b>
vertical relationship to God, <b>(b)</b> horizontal relationship to other
people, and <b>(c)</b> personal development in the context of these two
dimensions. It is an interpersonal relationship centered in love and
characterized by reciprocation. The first aspect is the God-to-us love spiral. Love
always involves an act of self-giving that expresses it. The first step in the
whole program is this, <i>“God so loved . . . that he gave . . . .”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6 </span>God’s love provokes our love in
self-giving obedience, <i>“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7 </span>The cycle is completed when it
says, <i>“If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8 </span>Starting at different places,

adds to faith virtue, the <u>knowledge</u>, self-control, patience, godliness,
brotherly kindness, and love—which things make us active and fruitful to the <u>knowledge</u>
of Jesus Christ. Saying that love is not easily provoked (1 Corinthians <b>13</b>:5)
amounts to calling it the means to self-control and Christian growth. Since that
process is triggered externally by the love of God and others, the Hebrew
writer urges frequent assembly for promoting mutual sanctification (Hebrews <b>10</b>:19-25).
Agape love contains both rational and emotional aspects. Those elements appear
to be arranged in parallel rather than in series, as in humanism. Rationality
and emotion reciprocally affect each other and conjointly or separately can
move the will to action. The synoptic character of love especially qualifies it
for the salvation and sanctification processes.</span></p>

answers the Calvinistic will of complacency</u>. No legal complaint could be
raised against passing over some in the saving of others because, on the basis

is not consistent with the nature of love. God loved the world when he gave his
Son. If God loved the <u>world</u> in such a way as to give his son to save it,
he does not balance his justice and his love by directing love to some and
justice to others in Augustianian fashion. Love and justice are balanced, not
by being directed to different people simultaneously, but by being directed to
the same people sequentially.</span></p>

the mechanisms for conversion</u>. <i>First</i>, love takes the initiative so
that reversing the downward spiral of deteriorating relationships comes by an
act of unprovoked love. <i>Secondly</i>, love is synoptic, functional,
interpersonal, and reciprocal. It addresses interpersonal relationships and
touches on everything that comprises people in community. Love is both rational
and emotional so that it combines cognitive and affective content with the
social dimension through reciprocal behavior. By making love central in the
real world of history, Christianity offers higher potential than competing
faiths for meeting the needs of the whole self in its relations. <u>Thirdly</u>,
love is resistible so that it avoids determinism. Love replaces natural miracle

depravity is impersonal, which shows up in misformulated emphasis on holiness. In
its place, a construct is needed that is resistible so as to avoid determinism
and yet be effective over non-Christian systems. It must have degrees to be
better than the pre-Christian condition and yet not produce sinless perfection.
That construct is love.</span></p>

18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The first four diagrams
above incorporate several important variables in God’s operation relative to
depravity in connection with the Fall, individual regeneration, and personal
sanctification. Some of these cannot be captured by diagrams designed to
picture depravitizing-undepravitizing process <i>per se</i>. In the fifth
diagram, we have supplied numbers at crucial points in the total process in
order to locate other variables that apply. At station #1 the variables include
<b>(a)</b> <u>hypostatic <i>vs</i>. psychological depravity</u>, which refers
to affirming or denying natural depravity. All the layouts except ours suppose
hypostatic depravity. Another variable here is <b>(b)</b> <u>total <i>vs</i>.
partial depravity</u> within the natural depravity category. By “total” in this
connection we mean that the depravity inheritable from the fall is so severe
that a person cannot initiate response without supernatural, miraculous
operation of the divine Spirit on our very nature itself (usually, “total”
depravity means that depravity affects all aspects of the human person). A
final variant here is <b>(c)</b> <u>racial depravity <i>vs</i>.
self-depravitization</u>, which corresponds respectively with whether the
depravity is or is not inheritable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            At station #2 a variable not
covered in the first diagrams is <b>(d) </b><u>necessity<i> vs</i>. possibility</u>
of response subsequent to regeneration. Calvinistic-Augustinian regeneration
was deterministic; regenerated persons never fail to respond to the gospel. Arminian
regeneration was potential; regeneration restored people’s spiritual capacities
to the point where they could choose whether they would accept the gospel. In
general, the baptistic community has taken this alternate approach. By “baptistic”
we mean a broader spectrum of evangelical denominations than just those that
include the word <u>Baptist</u> in their name. Furthermore, there is a
difference between <b>(e)</b> <u>restoration by miracle <i>vs</i>. influence</u>.
A variable in station #2 plus #3 is <b>(f)</b> <u>partial <i>vs</i>. total
restoration</u>. Those who speak of natural, or hypostatic, depravity make the
restoration partial—in this life at least—except for the Wesleyan tradition. In
the latter there is a second definite work of miraculous grace either
simultaneous or subsequent to the regenerating grace unto conversion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That last distinction in
turn parallels <b>(g)</b> <u>miraculous or non-miraculous sanctification</u>,
that is, enablement to grow by miracle or influence. In the first option
miraculous regeneration is by operating grace; sanctification is by
co-operating grace. Regeneration is made possible by miracle while
sanctification is made possible by influence. Correlating with that distinction
is <b>(h) </b><u>terraced <i>vs</i>. degreed sanctification</u>, that is,
whether sanctification is instantaneous or processual. Wesleyan sanctification
is instantaneous insofar as there is a full restoration of pre-Fall spiritual
capacity; the person in fact may then grow under personal influence into the
ideal human person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A final variable not
addressed by the diagrams is <b>(i)</b> <u>apostasy <i>vs</i>. non-apostasy</u>.
In Augustine and Calvin free will is not involved either in becoming saved or
staying saved.  In the baptistic heritage there is free will in becoming saved
but not in staying saved—either because genuine conversion always lasts
(perseverance) or because God never withdraws salvation as a state no matter
what the person does (eternal security) or because God takes a person before he
degenerates to the point of reprobation. Perseverance is more characteristic of
the Calvinistic tradition while eternal security is more characteristic of the
baptistic heritage. In the Cottrell, Wesleyan, and Warren formulations, free
will is involved both in becoming saved and staying saved. Apostasy is possible
behaviorally, relationally, and statively; people can turn away from practical
Christian living, lose their interpersonal relationship with God, and no longer
be saved.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>17</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our own position in this
whole cluster of issues is that no demonstrable difference exists between
pre-Fall Adam and post-Fall Adam as far as spiritual capacity based in
inheritable nature is concerned. Since depravitization is not hypostatic,
neither regeneration nor sanctification is <u>miraculous</u>; they occur <u>because
of influence</u> rather than miracle. No one grows to the point of behavioral
perfection, but the change that does take place is <u>degreed change</u>
through influence instead of categorical change through miracle. Therefore, it
is <u>reversible</u> rather than one-directional. The power of sin is <u>habit</u>
not privation; it is <u>psychological</u>, not ontic. The pull of the past has
the character of habit, not the loss, weakening, or disordering of being. Interpersonalism
is the fundamental reality behind all these conclusions, whether they deal with
our nature, our behavior, or our relationship with God and other people.</span></p>

significantly how we conceptualize the process of (a) coming to salvation and
(b) continuing in salvation. Consequently, it affects the role of the Holy
Spirit, the value of apologetics for unbelievers, the process of interpretation,
the definition and manner of regeneration/conversion/salvation, the nature of
Christian growth, the reversibleness of salvation. T-U-L-I-P has long served as

T-U-L-I-P system injects ontic and legal factors that do not belong to
interpersonal relationships because both ontic and legal are impersonal
factors. Ontic elements introduce an inheritable defective nature that irresistible
miracle must correct. Unconditionality, limited atonement, and eternal security
are legal concepts. We need to “do theology” with interpersonalism as the
primary category. Ontic and legal considerations do not have a decisive bearing
on the matter at all. Their place, if anywhere, is practical and secondary. At
best, <u>legal matters</u> reinforce interpersonal ones; if the interpersonal
element is not there, legal operation can do nothing. <u>Ontic matters</u> drop
out of the evaluation process (judgment) unless, of course, they somehow
resulted from a person’s own self-destruction for which he was responsible in
the first place—self-depravitization in a natural sense. In other words, by way
of summary, instead of picking off various petals from the tulip, we need to

the <u>tulip</u> with a <u>daisy</u>. A daisy diagram captures something of the
nature of the situation. Interpersonalism is the basic reality in the Christian
worldview. We let that reality account for as much of revelation experience as
we can. Abstract thought, ontic being, and legal process do not come into the
picture except where scripture brings them in, and it brings them into the
picture within the larger interpersonal framework. The aspects of Christianity
we understand in an interpersonal sense. We can add petals to represent aspects
of that interpersonal process.</span></p>

account for <u>depraved behavior</u>, we have used a person’s own previous sins
to account for it. We have appealed to corruptibility rather than corruption,
self-perversion rather than race perversion. Here belong addiction and
compulsive behaviors, which combine psychological and chemical dependencies. We
admit the possibility of body chemistry affecting more than we might suppose,
but we do not absolutize that mechanism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

more than ontic basis. Instead of appealing to ontic miracle and medical
treatment to account for <u>behavioral change,</u> we have looked primarily to
interpersonal influence for both conversion and growth. We do not need to deny
a physical component in behavior nor the affecting of such components by
previous behavior, but that is self-depravitization. We do not expect to find a
chemical cure for behavioral problems although medical treatment can affect
some behaviors. Examples of perhaps surprising behavioral difficulties that can
be chemically affected are certain kinds of emotional and compulsive behaviors.
Emotionally driven behaviors include depression and its consequences,
aggression, and the like. The reversal of these tendencies can involve getting
rid of things like sugar and caffeine intake and using certain chemical,
electrical, or surgical treatments.</span></p>

self-depravitization: Paul says in Romans <b>1</b> that when we sin we receive

being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin (Hebrews <b>3</b>); sin deceives. Not
only is sin a habit, but sin is a hardener (<u>sin hardens</u>/<u>sin weakens</u>,
a weight—Hebrews <b>13</b>:2: will, <i>etc</i>.) That is why we call them sin; the
designer has told us how to live with ourselves and other people.</span></p>

innocence factors as givens in human nature that influence addresses and that
prime the pump for profitable hearing of the good news. Natural givens in us

say “in many cases” because theologians who believe in natural depravity do not
necessarily also believe in “irresistible grace,” as it is called. The Spirit’s
miraculous regeneration of sinners brings them to the point where they can
accept or reject the gospel. This latter approach usually includes the idea
that each of us during our life experiences this miraculous regeneration as a
kind of “common grace.” Consequently, the “limited atonement” in
Augustine-Calvin shifts to “whosoever will” (see comments on “TULIP” later in
this chapter as well as the materials in<i> What the Bible Says About Salvation</i>,
pp. 466-68; cp. 132-33, 150, 222-23, 529, and 560).</span></p>

the Christian system works. In regard to Luther, for example, Harry J. McSorley
maintained that the real controversy between him and the Roman Catholic church
was the freedom of the will: “Luther’s Central Concern: Neither Papacy,
Purgatory or Indulgences,” <i>One in Christ</i>, Vol. III (1967), pp., 429-31. James
Arminius in <i>The Writings of James Arminius</i> (Vol. I, p. 345) defined
freedom as the ability to refrain from acting when all requisites for acting
are present.</span></p>

is no distinction between relational and stative. We have included both
expressions here because some who believe in eternal security seem to think
that a person can lose friendship with God but not status with God. Salvation
seems to be a legal state of non-hell comparable to continued sonship with an estranged
father. By way of contrast, interpersonalism in salvation means that if the
friendship is gone there is nothing left. “Salvation state” means precisely
personal relationship with him.</span></p>
