Contribution of “Restorationism”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A less emphasized
contribution of the Restoration Movement has been its dispensing with the centuries-old
concept of natural depravity. The idea originated with Augustine of Hippo (354-430),
who was emerging from the Greek philosophical tradition that did philosophy in
the ontic category, in particular, Manichaeism. His seminal notion was that
evil was a privation of form in being relative to its pristine condition, with
perverted function arising from the deformation. That explanation of theodicy applied
to the human condition and its behavioral outworking called sin. The
Reformation and contemporary evangelicalism as well have incorporated that
concept into their systematics. A student of historical theology has to go from
the Stone-Campbell movement all the way into liberalism to find an absence of
the natural depravity concept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Origin of the Natural Depravity
Concept</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Despite no satisfactory
foundation for it in scripture, Augustine imagined that a part of the curse,
pursuant to mankind’s first sin, was a depravitizing of the human condition, a
condition that was passed on, as we would say, genetically, to the whole human
race; Adam and Eve were the human race and the source of it. That loss of
ability resulted from God’s direct curse on human nature or came perhaps as a
natural consequence of the sinful act itself. Because of depravity, humankind
cannot adequately do good or respond to it. So Augustine’s answer to evil as a <u>kind
of being</u> was a privation in the <u>form of being</u> relative to its pristine
condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The values of the concept for
Christian theology have been to guarantee that (1) we all sin (hamartology) and
that (2) self-salvation is not possible; so all notions of “works” are
precluded (autosoterism).</span></p>

Depravity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The natural depravity notion spills
over into soteriology by adding a supernatural component to the process. God must
reverse the depravity he first plagued us with, before we can respond to the
gospel (justification) and Christian growth can take place (sanctification).<sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            From that point on,
soteriology braids out into several courses like the Nile on its way to the
Mediterranean. That “braiding” can be organized around the familiar (arbitrary
divine choice +) T U L I P in “five-point” Calvinism. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>An Alternative Reconstruction </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Augustine’s philosophical programmatic
colors the reading of biblical texts in unnecessary ways and complicates the
theological picture tremendously. Calvin’s additions (1579-1625) further
complicate and sidetrack the whole theological enterprise. It is that historical
overgrowth that I think Alexander Campbell and company were trying to prune
away in their stricture on (speculative) “theology.” They combined that
stricture with “restoration” to the original kerygma understood as a hermeneutics
of <u>text</u>, bereft of the accretions of <u>conceptual</u> speculations derived
from theological method over time, especially those of Augustine and John
Calvin. The former brought ontology into the issue, and the latter brought
legal process into it, including soteriological elements built atop Augustinian
anthropology. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My own
understanding departs from the whole foreign reconstruction in the Augustinian-Calvinistic
system by formulating theology (holistic topical understanding) under (a)
interpersonalism driven by influence as opposed to the other three major
conceptualizations: (b) legalism driven by authority, (c) ontic nature driven
by force/power/miracle/authority, and (d) metaphysics driven by form. In this
presenter’s opinion, though eschewing Calvinism-Augustinianism has not been completely
successful, the Restoration Movement has largely “demystified” anthropology and
to a significant extent its soteriological outworkings as well. In practice,
cross-fertilization from other Christian traditions affects the thinking of
individuals who identify with the movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Lack of Need for Natural Depravity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In contrast to the
Augustinian-Calvinistic formulation, biologically inherited natural depravity seems
unnecessary for (1) explaining universal human sinfulness, because Adam and Eve
sinned without it. Besides, universal sinfulness is adequately explained by a
combination of (a) evil social influence directed at (b) pervertible bodily
drives, and (c) at an individual’s viewpoint of consciousness, which lends
itself easily to self-centeredness, the essential opposite of <i>“Loving your
neighbor as yourself.”</i> All three elements appear in “the falling,” not just
in the consequences of it. By implication each of us re-enacts what happened
with our first parents. Psychological depravity adequately accounts for
universal sin; natural depravity is overkill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(2) Natural
depravity also has no necessary place in avoiding self-salvation. (a) The
inability in autosoterism lies in the nature of imperfection, not in the nature
of us. Imperfection cannot be overcome once it is the case. Perfection is the
natural, original, and permanent standard for all personal associations, especially
fellowship with our holy God.<b><sup>2</sup></b><sup> </sup>(b)<sup> </sup>Furthermore,
the inability of autosoterism lies in the fact that salvation is
reconciliation, which is an interpersonal process. Acceptance back into
fellowship (reconciliation) lies decisively in the willingness of the offended
person (alienation) to forgive and accept an offender back into relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
Concluding Observation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            For practical purposes, we can
get on with the Christian enterprise without settling the current problem. It
is something like working on a computer without knowing or understanding what the
computer is doing “in the background.” But to thoughtful people, the issue can cause
unnecessary doubt and caution that undercut Christian living and ministry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>____________</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>­­            <sup>1</sup>Besides its effects
on <u>anthropology</u> and <u>soteriology</u> themselves, natural depravity has
bled over into other ideas: the <u>immaculate conception</u> of Mary so she
could be theotokos (“deity-bearer”) and our Lord as a man could be born without
human depravity (original sin). It specializes <u>regeneration</u> into a supernatural
reversal of inborn inability so we can respond to the gospel. That spills
depravity over into <u>pneumatology</u> since the Spirit would be the agent who
regenerates the fallen nature at least to where response can occur. Further
degrees of enablement become part of the <u>sanctification</u> process,
including the doctrine of the second definite work of grace in Wesleyanism. Inherited
natural depravity contributed to the practice of <u>infant baptism</u>. Depravity
lay behind the notion of <u>quietude in missiology</u> because preaching the
gospel does not benefit conversion until God decides to parallel the
proclamation with regeneration. Human nature is part of the larger <u>theodicy</u>
issue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In <u>theology
proper</u>, the depravity doctrine raises questions also about divine
self-consistency. Why would God depravitize us so he would have to turn around
and un-depravitize us for reconciliation even to become possible? Why make the
problem even worse by cursing us with inability? Why make us inherently sinful
and then blame us for it? At least, if we sinned on our own like our first
parents did, it would be our fault. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It will not do to
suppose that objectors have no right to question God’s consistency on this
point. We are not questioning God’s consistency, but questioning a construction
of theology that makes him inconsistent. Sure, it is human reason doing the
questioning, but it is also human reason that has created this anomaly. Inconsistency
is the mark of error. It calls for reworking a human analysis of the issue. It
calls for getting rid of something that raises more questions than it answers, creates
more problems than it solves. Claiming no right to question simply attempts to put
correction beyond the pale of possibility; but if it is not falsifiable, it is not
verifiable. So, <u>apologetics</u> becomes another victim of an ill-advised
formulation that in turn works against faith and acceptance of the truth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hermeneutics</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> also falls victim
to the natural depravity concept because without human ability, there is no way
to decide whether to start conceptually with Psalm <b>51</b>:10 or Ezekiel <b>18</b>:31:
<i>“Create a clean heart and right spirit within me”</i> or <i>“Make for
yourselves a new heart and new spirit.”</i></span></p>

extended presentation on this subject, see <i>The Implication of Divine
Self-Consistency for the Doctrine of Natural Depravity: A Biblical-Systematic
Approach</i>. PhD Dissertation, 284 pp., presented to the Faculty of The

Dale Moody, professor of systematic theology. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The dissertation
argues that insufficient positive basis exists in scripture for the doctrine of
natural depravity. Beyond that, the dissertation shoulders the negative burden
of proof to argue that scripture eliminates it as an understanding of human nature,
hence, the title element <i>Divine Self-Consistency</i>.</span></p>
