<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God created us to have <u>fellowship</u>
with him, so he made us in his image by giving us the <u>interpersonal capacity</u>.
But in practice there has always been a breakdown in the realization of that
potential in every individual, a breakdown we may call <u>depravity</u>.<sup>1 </sup>Like
Satan and the fallen angels earlier, every one of us has failed to express our
capacity adequately or correctly. In different ways and to varying extents we
fail to function interpersonally, in conformity to our own created nature, and
in accordance with divine purpose. With the exception of Jesus Christ, each of
us has misused the specific abilities that comprise interpersonal capacity and
its derivatives, and thereby has affected all aspects of ourselves, our
relations, and our destiny; so we say that everyone has <u>total depravity</u>.
It turns out that in varying degrees, depravity has been universal since the
beginning and all-pervasive in every person that ever lived. Depravity means
that although everyone has the real <u>creatable image</u>, no one fully has
the ideal <u>ethical image</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For purposes of thought and
discussion, within the ethical image we distinguish between <u>behavioral</u>
and <u>psychological</u> depravity even though in the real situation these two
aspects are inseparable and feed on each other. <u>Behavioral depravity</u>
simply means sinning; it is action that misuses or fails to use the abilities
intended for positive personal relationship and purpose. Behavioral depravity
functions in ways contrary to nature, relationship, and purpose. Our acts,
however, do not simply occur; they affect the doers as well as leave in them a
propensity to recur and a practical inability not to recur. Good acts occur,
recur, and strengthen; sinful ones occur, recur, and ruin. Consequently, <u>psychological
depravity</u> results from personal behavior reciprocated into the self. Psychological
depravity <u>is</u> ingrained anti-interpersonalism; it <u>is caused by</u>
ignorance plus evil influence brought to bear on psycho-physical drives—matters
we will elaborate presently. From the <u>practice</u> of sin comes not only the
<u>presence</u> and <u>penalty</u> of sin, but the <u>power</u> of sin to
enslave and destroy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is a correlation then
between the two aspects of human depravity and two of the three biblical usages
of words for “sin.” Sin is <u>action</u> contrary to a shared standard, a <u>social
state</u> of separation that results from such action, a <u>personal condition</u>
that comes from acting contrary to (inter)personal nature assumed in the shared
standard, and a <u>purposeless existence</u> as measured by divine commission. Sin
takes our morally neutral abilities and uses them in negative ways instead of
positive ones. “Depravity” addresses the first and third aspects of sin; “lostness”
addresses the second and fourth aspects of sin. A depraved person is one who
has sinned and thereby perverted himself, broken relationships, and become
objectively meaningless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            First, depravity means
unwholesome <u>behavior</u>. It is a breakdown in expressing the creatable
image. Depravity means not exercising the personal-interpersonal capacity
appropriately. Consequently, it is individualism, egocentrism,
anti-interpersonalism, non-self-transcendence. Since the image is a capacity,
depravity is not a loss of the created image or part(s) of it or even some
degree of it;<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2 </span>it is a
failure to use and express it appropriately. Second, depravity is <u>bondage</u>.
Bad behavior not only tends to enslave the self, but to separate us from others
and cut ourselves off from purposeful existence (life) in a way we cannot do
anything about on our own. Depravity is not necessarily the loss of the
potential even though from a functional standpoint misuse does tend to ruin,
but misuse does not irreversibly ruin in most cases. Needless to say, since
depravity represents our own failure to actualize—or actualize perfectly—our
interpersonal potential, the responsibility and guilt for depravity lies with us,
not God<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> or someone else. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Four factors describe
depravity. As already noted, most generally (1) <u>depravity involves a
breakdown between potential and actual</u>. The potential-actual differential
provides the reason depravity <u>can</u> happen. That difference establishes
the <u>possibility of the breakdown</u>. The image as interpersonal <u>capacity</u>
represents a capability rather than a fulfillment. God’s creating the image
into us does not create an interpersonal reality, but an interpersonal
potential.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            More specifically the format
of the potential-actual breakdown in <u>depravity consists of using neutral
abilities in negative ways</u> rather than positive ones. The possibility of
not perfectly realizing the interpersonal potential is due to the undetermined
nature of specific abilities that comprise interpersonal capacity. The
potential-actual differential means that abilities are not deterministic. A
given ability does not have just one but several possible applications, some of
which vitiate interpersonal existence. Individual abilities are either
necessary for interpersonalism or appropriate to it. Inasmuch as God created
these abilities into all of us, each of us has the interpersonal capacity these
abilities comprise, that is, the image. In not fully realizing the capacity,
people do not lose it or irreversibly scar it up; they simply do not actualize
it as consistently as they should. Each specific ability or combination of
abilities can operate in ways that either do or do not fit with personal and
interpersonal function and purposeful living: will, reason, creativity,
conscience, feelings, physical desires, self-awareness and self-transcendence;
psychological inclinations like the desire at least to <u>be</u> loved, the
drive for meaningfulness, the yearning for security, the impulse for innocence,
the capacity for habit formation, the social inclination. They are formal, not
contentful; they are occasional, not material, causes of sin. Using these
capacities dysfunctionally constitutes behavioral depravity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since the image is
interpersonal capacity, depravity is described in terms of the interpersonal
framework. Consequently, (2) <u>depravity collapses the interpersonal into the
individual</u>. That is the overall <u>pattern of the breakdown</u>. Depravity
is the individual person’s failure to become, and be, fully interpersonal. It
is our failure to be “more than” individual. Bipolar interpersonalism collapses
into unipolar individualism. Instead of the balance implied by <u>inter</u>-<u>person</u>alism,
there is a withdrawing into the individual. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) <u>Depravity reduces the
personal into the impersonal</u>. For all practical purposes, it reduces the
personal toward the “animal.” It tends toward making us into a
stimulus-response beings; it reduces us from living by our higher nature to
living by a lower nature, and operates by drives rather than decisions relative
to values. Depravity “sows to the flesh” (Galatians <b>6</b>:8). Depravity
makes us “psychical,” or “physical” (2 Corinthians<b> 3</b>:3), rather than
spiritual. Feelings go unchecked by will and reason, so there is a lack of
natural affection, concern, and love. We not only live individually, but
immanently. Collapsing the interpersonal into the individual and reducing the
personal into the animal are two major aspects of behavioral depravity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Living in a depraved way not
only fails to be self-transcendent, but time-transcendent as well. It refuses “authentic
existence” by not getting above our own point of view in time as well as space.
(4) <u>Depravity tends to collapse the future into the present</u>. It is
existential to the exclusion of the eschatological. Living only in the present
and living by drives are alike in not overriding the viewpoint of
consciousness. We disregard consequences and operate without purpose as part of
our motivation for acting. We tend toward immediate gratification at times when
we should practice delayed gratification. Since the rational capacity in the
image includes the ability to imagine, we can project our viewpoint over behind
the eyes of another person and live interpersonally as noted in the previous
entry. Similarly, by imagination we can project forward into the future and
consider the results of present behavior. So to speak, reciprocation should
take place between the present and the future. The present leads to
consequences in the future; and inasmuch as we can know that by warning or past
experience, the future shapes present action. Depraved behavior, however, tends
not to concern itself with the future either in respect to negative
consequences or positive purposefulness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the discussion above we
have used <u>depravity</u> broadly enough to cover sin as action contrary to a
standard for action and sin as alienation that results from sin. In common
usage, the term <u>depravity</u> most specifically connotes intensity and
highlights the personal perversion that results from sin and enslaves the
sinner—what may be called “psychological depravity.” In this sense, (5) <u>depravity
is the power of past failure over present resolve</u>. Not only can neutral
abilities be used in either negative or positive fashion; but when they are
used either way, a psychological imprint is left on the doer. Depravity in this
distinctive sense deals with the power of sin, a matter addressed more fully
below. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Depravity correlates with
sin and therefore with ethical theory and moral principles. Sin, ethics, and
morality address the interpersonal situation. As the collapse of the
interpersonal into the individual, depravity correlates with <u>sin as
self-centeredness</u> and pride. It breaches the principle of prioritizing the
common good over personal preference or individual welfare. Reducing the
personal to the impersonal violates the principle of <u>prioritizing the
spiritual over the material</u>. Living by the “lower nature” corresponds with <u>sin
as behavior based on drives rather than values</u>. Depravity includes <u>sin
as action contrary to nature</u>, that is, contrary to the interpersonal
situation and contrary to our own psychological and physical well-being. Depravity
includes <u>sin as action contrary to purpose</u>—especially divine purpose. Sin
is action contrary to purpose, contrary to nature that accomplishes purpose,
and contrary to relationship as an aspect of divine purpose; hence, sin is
action contrary to a shared standard for nature, fellowship, and mission; the
practice of sin brings depravity.</span></p>

Depravity </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The preceding section
described what depravity is and how it <u>can</u> happen. Now we need to
discuss why it <u>does</u> happen and why it happens universally and
all-pervasively. The <u>possibility of breakdown</u> between potential and
actual interpersonalism leads to considering the <u>reasons for actual
breakdown</u>. Reasons for depravity include originating and perpetuating
causes at the personal and interpersonal levels. These reasons fall into three
general categories: ignorance, influence, and desire. The success of these
causes plays on the fact that sin is easier and more intensely pleasurable at
the moment. Habit formation, or addiction, comes into the picture to make
harder the change back toward good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>The originating causes of
sin</u>. There are different forms of ignorance: viewpoint of consciousness especially
in the social setting, being unaware of what should be done or what is
expected. The originating causes of sin include sin without a tempter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Besides the <u>structural</u>
nature of the interpersonal situation and the ignorance possibility, there is
temptation<b> </b>aimed at<b> </b>bodily and psychological desires. Our own
depravity combines with other peoples’ contribution to it. It is easier to be
imminent than transcendent, individual rather than interpersonal, and
existential rather than eschatological. Transcendence includes rising above our
viewpoint. It is easier not to rise above the physical viewpoint to the
transcendent one, the individual viewpoint to the interpersonal one, or the
present viewpoint to the future one (projection of consciousness).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We live in several kinds of
tension. It is easier to be individual than interpersonal; individual is less
complex. It is easier to see our viewpoint than someone else’s; ours is more
real. It is easier to respond to the present environment than think about the
future hope. The present is more vivid than the future even though we can
project into the future to anticipate consequences even as we can project to
another person’s viewpoint to observe impact. The tendency to respond in kind
applies both to love for love and rejection for rejection. Our experience of
depravity in the world is a desire for self-actualization in tension with a
desire for social. These aspects of our situation are a fertile setting for
depravity to play itself out.        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We can transcend the
physical, the individual, and the present viewpoint. The physical, the present,
and the individual are more vivid and apparently “real” than the transcendent,
interpersonal, and the eschatological. They are not immediately available to
us; we have to “look past” these first awarenesses in order to see the second
ones—the needs of the psychological self, the needs others, and the effects in
the future. Our bent toward personal relationships&nbsp;sets us up for becoming
depraved by <u>evil social influence</u>. We do not enter a holy world or even
a morally neutral one. We enter one tainted by sin, and it is easier just to go
with the flow. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Combined with bodily drives
and a morally tainted environment is <u>ignorance</u> in several forms. When we
do not know something, we do not realize its effects. The most subtle form of
ignorance is <u>our individual viewpoint of consciousness</u> in place and
time. It could be called the “curse of particularity.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Development from birth to
adulthood</u> takes us through a more complicated experience than Adam and Eve’s.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God’s invisibility; the “silence
of God” is a mystery to us. We are tempted to think that <i>“hiding his face
from us”</i> only makes sin and disbelief a bigger problem. Paul’s programmatic
statement in Acts <b>17</b>:27 says that God appointed the human situation to
be such that people should seek God if perchance they might find him by groping
for him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Answers to this problem
include the idea that (1) God cannot stand being in the presence of sin, which
the incarnation denies. Others have thought that (2) God does not care (deism).
More likely is the observation that (3) we would not handle it well if God were
continually showing himself to us. Adam and Eve, prophets like Isaiah, and
others were afraid even when angels appeared to them. <b>(</b>4) Visible
presence would make us feel that God was “standing over us,” and we would serve
him out of fear more than freedom; we would obey out of a sense of coercion
more than willingly. Because of the sin and guilt factor, direct manifestation
would not fit with the interpersonal character he has chosen for the nature of
the human circumstance. God was striving for a higher kind of righteousness—one
practiced in the perceived absence of him as well as when he is <i>“walking
with us in the Garden.”</i> Even in the Garden, God came and went. It was
during one of his absences that Adam and Eve succumbed to the tempter. So even
in the ideal situation God appeared and disappeared instead of remaining
constantly visible. (5) God is more interested in our response to the real
opportunities he gives than our response to reality itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It does not create a problem
for eternity because (a) God has made himself known in special revelation. (b) Those
without special revelation he can judge by general revelation, especially by conscience.
(c) Hone way or the other he has given everyone adequate evidence for himself
relative to his judgment of them. (d) The problem is that we have characteristically
turned aside from him, not in a state of ignorance but of knowledge (Romans<b>
1</b>:21). We need sufficient evidence, not overwhelming evidence. (e) God
gives us more dignity by not smothering with his presence, not flooding us with
attention, or “hot housing” us to be perfect. Giving us greater freedom implies
affording us greater respect. (f) Strength of evidence does not correlate with
the likelihood of response. If we do not believe the written record of God’s
manifestation, we may not believe even direct divine manifestation itself (note
the rich man and Lazarus in Luke <b>16</b>:29-31). The reason is probably that
disbelief is more a function of attitude than of evidence. Finally, (g) in many
ways God is the more glorified by the <u>less</u> he does for us. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In all the explanations for
why we sin, the common element is that sin is easier. It is easier to yield to
bodily drives; it is easier to be non-interpersonal and non-eschatological. That
may be why God has given us a chance at reconciliation but has evidently not
done so for disobedient angels and especially for Satan who sinned without a
tempter (<i>“father of lies”</i>;<i> </i>John <b>8</b>:44). The psalmist says
that God has compassion on us because <i>“he knows our frame”</i> (<b>103</b>:13-16;
<b>78</b>:39).</span></p>

The Perversion of What Has Been Developed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The perpetuating causes of
sin have both social and individual components. In its social dimension, <u>personal
influence</u> is the mechanism. As influence brought sin into the human race,
so also it moves it from person to person and generation to generation. In
doing so, influence is not a separate factor because it appeals to various factors
in the individual: the bodily drives, ignorance, <i>etc</i>., noted above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            At the individual level, <u>habit
formation</u> adds a mechanism for perpetuating sin. “Self-depravitizing” is
more than personally becoming a sinner; it includes receiving in ourselves the
perverting consequences of sinning (Romans <b>1</b>:27). These consequences
include the physical consequences of profligate living as well as more subtle,
psychological effects. Deterioration because of sin comes as a reciprocal,
transactional, residual deposit in the one that sins.<b> </b>The perpetuating
causes of sin include the originating causes, because the features of human
existence that brought sin into the experience of Adam and Eve can bring sin
anew into the experience of everybody throughout history. Beyond the continued
operation of originating causes, we add social reinforcement and personal habit,
habit being the distinctive item for the perpetuating sin in the individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Depravitizing depends on the
transacting and reciprocating<b> </b>mechanisms in habit formation (James <b>1</b>:14-15).
They in turn are a function of our integrated nature. It is
self-depravitization even when the originating causes lie outside us in the
negative influences of society. It is our <u>response</u> not the temptation
that leaves its residual effect in our psyche. “Distinctively” is the point
because our desire to be meaningful, accepted (loved), innocent, and secure are
givens that do not belong under habit formation and retention; it is our
response in them that leaves its mark. There are psychological habits like
feeling angry, feeling depressed, wanting to criticize, sensing a need to
withdraw in situations that threaten security and raise fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The desire for acceptance
(love) can be misused by social <i>temptation</i>. Within the individual a
conflict arises between his interpersonal bent and self-awareness, between
social identity and self-identity. Depravity creates inner conflict between
individual viewpoint and social bent, between self-consciousness and
interpersonal impulse (cp. Romans <b>7</b>:12ff.). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That conflict showed itself in
the sin of our first parents. Eating the forbidden fruit pitted their desire
for personal welfare against interpersonal relationship with God and his
purpose for them. Personal self-awareness led to interpersonal
self-consciousness. They sensed nakedness and fear before the Person they
presumably loved. Even though it was not good for Adam to be alone (Genesis<b>
2</b>:18), his sin created a distance between himself and Eve as he implied by
his accusation, <i>“The woman you gave to be with me gave me some of the fruit”</i>
(Genesis <b>3</b>:12).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The desire for
self-preservation and identity can respond to social <i>rejection</i> by
competitive, defensive behavior as well as it might for attention-getting
behavior. The difference between defensive behavior and attention-getting
behavior lies respectively in the positive or negative perception of others. Rejection
by others leads to withdrawal or competition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Habit is behavior ingrained
by repetition as<b> </b><u>scripture</u> says: hardened <i>by the deceitfulness
of (previous) sin</i> (Hebrews<b> 3</b>:13; Acts<b> 19</b>:9—hardened and
disobedient). Hardening involves willful action inasmuch as God commands people
not to harden their hearts (Hebrews<b> 3</b>:13 &lt; Psalm <b>95</b>:8;
Deuteronomy <b>15</b>:7). For the most part, hardening is indirect willful
action since we usually do not will to harden ourselves; we just do things that
harden us. Scripture says that God hardens the heart. Previous sin hardens us
(our “hearts”); we know from experience that repeated actions dull the
sensitivity of the body and it becomes subject to the law of diminishing
returns. That process occurs at the psychological level as well. Dead in
trespasses and sins, not only means separate from God, but insensitive to the
consequences of sin as well as to the very fact that we are sinning (Ephesians<b>
2</b>:1ff). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

Experience shows us the same thing. Consequences come from misdeeds that we learn
too late lead nowhere and fail to satisfy. It hurts to care and then be
rejected, so we quit caring. That can happen with the conscience, the will, the
attitudes, the intellect, the feelings, even the physical senses. Hardening can
happen toward other people, the future, invisible and spiritual things, which
are easier to shut out than tangible things. This all can come both false
teaching (1 Timothy<b> 4</b>:1-2ff) and deliberate ignorance (Ephesians <b>4</b>:18;

figures for psychological insensitivity: “hardened,” “dead,” “seared with a hot
iron” (scarred and callous), “hard of hearing” (“dull of hearing”), “blind,” “stiff-necked”/“hardened
the neck [Nehemiah<b> 9</b>:16, 29]”; not turning our heads to see what God is
showing us or facing him when he calls us, “hardening the face (Proverbs <b>21</b>:29;
Ecclesiastes <b>8</b>:1; cp. Deuteronomy<b> 28</b>:50—“fierce countenance”),” <i>“shutting
up bowels of compassion”</i> (1 John <b>3</b>:17). Impenitence (Romans <b>2</b>:5)
is another kind of insensitivity. Psychological de-sensitizing takes place on
the analogy of physical de-sensitizing; callousness is comparable to calluses. </span></p>

good or ill.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>The ability
compensates for the limit we have on how many things we can consciously handle

The power of depravity goes under the expressions “bondage,” “bondage of the

mind when he said, <i>“A man is brought into bondage by whatever overcomes him”</i>
(2 Peter <b>2</b>:19). Included here can be the more extreme forms of habit
that we call <u>addiction</u>, or “getting hooked,” which can be a combination
of chemical and psychological dependency. With a more psychological turn are
such things as impulsive, obsessive, and <u>compulsive behavior</u>. Depravity <u>is</u>
the result and <u>cause</u> of these results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Influence is the mechanism
for reversing depravity. As negative influence on neutral abilities leads to bad
behavioral and psychological depravity, so positive influence on dysfunctional
behaviors can change them to functional ones. What influence establishes it can
change; what it can do it can undo and redo—though there is a difference in the
<u>degree</u> of difficulty. Sin as habit is not what might look like one-way
chemical reaction—concrete formation, for example. Even seemingly “one-way
chemical actions” can actually be reversed by other chemical reactions—even if
it takes a while, otherwise, the whole universe would eventually become
concrete, so to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If we take our cue from the
nature of habit, changing depravity comes primarily by substitution. Reversing <u>behavioral</u>
depravity calls for revelation to replace ignorance, good influence to replace
bad influence, and proper fulfillment of desires to replace their sinful
fulfillment. Reversing <u>psychological</u> depravity by proper behavior is the
normal technique for &quot;breaking a habit.&quot; As bad habits are not
changed by going from doing something bad to doing nothing, so also
psychological depravity is not changed by heeding prohibitions. We need to
practice alternative mandates. Most sins are dysfunctional so escaping the pull
of past sin takes place by fulfilling those desires in good, functional ways,
not by stifling them or trying to ignore them. The greater and more
long-lasting satisfaction that comes from righteous living erodes the pull to
fulfill desires in former sinful ways. Since feelings and desires are
established by action, doing different actions changes old bents to new ones. If
bents come from experience rather than heredity, then new bents come from new
experience. Bents and feelings lead to actions, and actions reinforce bents and
feelings. It is easier to will an action than to will a feeling or a bent. To
change the affections, then, we best go at it indirectly by willing to change
action. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Because of what the image
is, we can at least <u>be</u> loved even if in extreme cases we have virtually
lost the ability <u>to</u> love. The values of spiritual exercises are then
self-evident. Bible reading, meditation, communion, prayer, fellowship,
fasting, and service are at the same time means of change and means of growth we
can take the initiative in doing. Other Christians, in fulfilling their mission
mandate, can also take the initiative to persuade and motivate in conversion
and sanctification. The mechanics of both processes are the same: interpersonal
influence in its several forms. Sanctification is behavioral and psychological
change. The whole pattern of conversion and sanctification forms a continuum of
interacting aspects. The pattern begins with (a) influence from other people in
revelation, positive example, persuasion, encouragement, motivation, and
reinforcement. Both God and other people take the initiative in shedding
influence. The pattern continues with (b) the willing of alternative actions
that tend to (c) change feelings and bents so that (d) continuing those
alternative behavior patterns is easier and more consistent. That process takes
advantage of  reciprocity between persons between the inner and outer aspects
of each person.</span></p>

with miracle as habit contrasts with defect. Influence includes factors by
which one person affects the actions of another without circumventing his will.
Forms of influence include example/modeling, expressions of caring, giving
reasons, supplying motivation, offering hope, forgiving guilt, communicating
the person’s worth, offering relationship, providing purpose, being
trustworthy, establishing security, and meeting needs in general. Influence
does not appeal to <u>authority,</u> <u>force</u>, <u>manipulation</u>, or <u>miracle</u>.
Influence works through the will of the other rather than contrary to it or
aside from it. It occurs in the shared realm of interpersonal capacity; it is
not supernatural like miracle is. Natural and supernatural are not entirely
parallel categories since we share something with God called the image. Since
the nature of a cause must fit the nature of the effect, a natural defect would
require impersonal miraculous operation; but psychological habit can be
reversed by interpersonal influence that raises motivation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Depravity is a breakdown
between the interpersonal potential and its actuality. Behaviorally, depravity
collapses the interpersonal into the individual, reduces the personal into the
impersonal, and loses the eschatological. Psychologically, our behavior gets
ingrained into ourselves by way of the capacity for habit formation and then creates
a bondage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

abilities/characteristics meet temptation and for habits that harden and make
insensitive to positive influence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The originating and
perpetuating reasons for universal and all-pervasive sin are threefold: <u>ignorance</u>
in the form of &quot;innocence,&quot; our viewpoint of consciousness, God’s
invisibility, and misunderstood good example; <u>society</u> in the form of
evil example, social pressure, forced behavior especially in the unconscious
years, and social reinforcement; and <u>physical nature</u> in the form of
pervertible bodily drives. These originating and perpetuating causes create
hardening and habit, which in turn binds us and perpetuates our behavior
(addiction). These factors combine with the fact that sin is easier and more
intensely pleasurable and the fact that overcoming insensitivity and breaking
addiction is harder and more painful.</span></p>

conventional usage, <u>depravity</u> implies significant sinfulness—at least <u>characteristic</u>
sinfulness. That implication probably comes from the tendency to associate the
word with the second aspect of depravity that we are designating psychological
depravity.</span></p>

could speak about a loss of the “image” in Paul’s extended sense of the term—the
ethical sense, or the “ethos,” but that would address a different issue. In the
history of theological reflection, it has been common to equate the two
referents of the one term <u>image</u> or at least to make a one-for-one
connection between them. In such thinking, the image Paul says is being
restored in Christ (Romans <b>8</b>:29) is identified with, or
deterministically correlated with, the image that God created into mankind
(Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27). On the assumption that <u>image</u> has one referent—or
two referents welded together, restoring the image implies that it has been
lost, partially lost, or weakened. The problem with that reconstruction is
twofold: first, it confuses words and realities, and second, it
deterministically connects created being and express behavior. That root notion
about natural depravity <i>vs</i>. behavioral-psychological depravity spreads
systematically throughout the considerable number of areas connected with our
ontic nature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In these comments we are assuming a
viewpoint on the rationalism-empiricism issue. Rationality is inborn and gives
the “forms” of knowledge while empiricism supplies the content. Developmental
psychology teaches us that some abilities come to realization during the
developmental experience. Language acquisition, for example, needs to occur
when that skill is “programmed” to happened. If it is not—as with feral
children, it may not be possible later to develop it very well.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span>Abilities
within the image are “neutral.” The ability to form habits is neither good nor
bad; misusing it is sinful. That explains why God is not guilty for human and
angelic depravity. Though he is not <u>guilty</u>, he is <u>responsible</u> for
dealing with sin because he created that possibility and can stop its
realization. He does something about it by <u>limiting</u> it through
revelation, redemption, intervention, and consummation. <u>Revelation</u> tells
people how they ought to act for people’s greatest fulfillment and for the purposes
God has for us. <u>Redemption</u> offers to bring back from depravity those
caught up in expressing it. <u>Intervention</u> limits the degree of expressing
depravity, and <u>consummation</u> puts an end to it after sufficient
opportunity for revelation and redemption to accomplish their purposes (Romans <b>2</b>:4;
2 Peter <b>3</b>:9, 15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The idea that abilities are “neutral” does
not deny the fact that using them in “good” ways brings greater fulfillment by
contributing to positive interpersonal experience. Greater fulfillment in
living comes from using abilities in ways that foster positive feedback from
other people. “Neutral” also does not deny that using abilities in “good” ways
produces more long-lasting positive results. The ability to form habits,
choose, <i>etc</i>., are “undetermined” abilities in that we can use them in
more than one way. They are “neutral” in that it is only the <u>way</u> we use
them that raises the moral issue. </span></p>
