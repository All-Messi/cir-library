<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since the nature of mankind is a central
consideration in Christian theology, the doctrine of natural depravity in mankind
affects a variety of issues and impacts them in significant ways. The following
enumeration of consequences may not be necessary in every case, but historically
this concept has triggered them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. <u>Anthropology</u> itself is
significantly different because mankind is understood as born without the full
spiritual capacity that Adam and Eve had before they sinned. Beyond the
consequences of their sin that Genesis <b>3</b> and elsewhere indicate, natural
depravity adds to the silence of scripture by saying that in some way—either by
built-in natural result or direct divine penalty—their sin led to a defective
genetic nature that everybody has biologically inherited. Because we all have
descended from the same pair, we are all infected with this defect in every
aspect of our being. The <u>will</u> is weakened so that we cannot resist
temptation even when we want to. The <u>affections</u> are so disoriented that
often we do not even want to resist. We do not love what we should. Even
emotional disorders may integrate with natural depravity. Bodily <u>drives</u>
are perverted, which accounts for unwholesome sexual desires, homosexuality,
bestiality, gluttony, drunkenness, as well as inhibitive and compulsive
behaviors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <u>intellect</u> is skewed at least
relative to spiritual matters, so that we are blind to what should be “as clear
as the nose on our face.” Some have integrated the concept more broadly by
connecting it with the idea that supposedly people use only 5-8% of the brain’s
capacity. That somehow represents the difference between the IQ of fallen and
unfallen man. Unfallen Adam could use 100% of his brain power and was more
intelligent than afterward. He supposedly had great intuitive knowledge as well
as greater intellectual power than anyone has now. Some have claimed that he
had such a grasp of natural science as is unattainable today (John Laidlaw, <i>The
Bible Doctrine of Man</i>, 1895; see Gordon Clark, pp. 20-21).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. The doctrine of <u>sin</u>
(hamartology) changes because, in addition to sin as <u>action</u> contrary to
a shared standard for action and sin as a consequent <u>state</u> of alienation
resulting from that action, there is sin as a <u>condition</u> of human nature
before regeneration and to a significant extent afterward. This latter point
raises some speculations on Paul’s self-description in Romans <b>7</b>:12ff. To
some interpreters, the struggle would not even occur if Paul were describing
his unregenerate state. To others, the struggle must not refer to his
regenerate state or he would be succeeding in that struggle; Christ delivers
from <i>“this body of death”</i> (<b>7</b>:24-25). Depravity serves as the
primary explanation for universal, all-pervasive sin; sin negatively affects
every human being in every aspect of self and associations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Those who adopt the doctrine of natural
depravity usually take a <u>dim view of unregenerate people’s morality</u>. They
are overly negative about the sinfulness of sinners. Because of unavoidable
inherited depravity, people cannot be good, not simply in the biblical sense
that no one does everything right, but in the sense that no one does anything
right. Even the “good” they do is evil. Not only can they not do <u>good</u>, but
they cannot do <u>a good</u>. Their “good” act is evil because of tainted motives
perhaps. Benevolence and philanthropy may look good, but they are apt to be
perverted by some self-seeking motive, some attention-getting behavior that
feeds pride. Another tack says that the good act is evil because they do not do
it to the glory of God—a true observation in a sense because the unbeliever is not
acting in the name of Christ. The fear seems to be that if we admit that
unsaved people can do any good at all, we risk the assumption that they could
do all good, which in turn they falsely understand to imply that unbelievers
could save themselves. The self-salvation inference is unacceptable because
that would mean there is another way under heaven by which salvation is
possible than by the name of Jesus Christ; Christ then died for nothing. So we
pass to the next observation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3. Salvation (<u>soteriology</u>) is
complexified because supernatural <u>regeneration</u> must occur from God
before <u>conversion</u> can happen. Ontic rehabilitation must occur before
behavioral change can take place. If sin is ontologized, salvation must be
supernaturalized; if being is defective, miracle must repair it. “New birth,” “born
again,” “regeneration,” is not just an image for a new life in which we “start
over again” as from birth; it becomes a change of substance rather than just a change
of behavior and relationship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Natural depravity serves as a basis for
denying self-salvation—<u>autosoterism</u>. The reasoning they cannot “save themselves”
is that they cannot respond influence. So parallel to proclamation there must
be supernatural operation to enable them to respond to the message. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Classical Calvinism has been summarized
under the TULIP acronym: <u>T</u>otal depravity, <u>U</u>nconditional election,
<u>L</u>imited atonement, <u>I</u>rresistible grace, and <u>P</u>erseverance of
the saints. Total depravity logically precedes <u>unconditional election</u>
and sets the stage for it. Even if salvation could in theory be conditional
without being by works, it cannot be conditional for one practical reason: people
do not have the ability to meet the condition. If election is unconditional,
atonement need not be intended for more than those whom God has unconditionally
designed to save; hence, total depravity correlates with a limited (<i>vs</i>.
universal) <u>scope of the atonement</u>. Christ did not die for everybody, but
for those arbitrarily chosen ahead of time. When grace is then dispensed, the previously
chosen will necessarily respond; there is <u>effectual grace</u>, <u>effectual
calling,</u> <u>irresistible grace</u>. Once God has repaired the fallen
nature, it is permanently capacitated; hence, we have <u>perseverance of the
saints</u> as well (see below). All four subsequent doctrines harmonize with
natural depravity even if they are not positively required by it strictly
speaking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            4. The <u>ordinances</u> become involved,
too, if baptism relates to salvation in some way. <u>Baptism</u> may be
affected because the ontic change can be associated with that event, a concept included
under the expression <u>baptismal regeneration</u>. At baptism the candidate
may be regarded as receiving the ability necessary for Christian faith and
practice. Particularly in the Lutheran tradition, there is even the notion of
infant faith that is engendered by the washing of regeneration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            5. In the Wesleyan tradition, <u>sanctification</u>
becomes an essentially supernatural act in which a saved person receives a
second benefit that removes the last vestiges of inbred sin—vestiges beyond
those removed by regeneration. Having been restored to full spiritual capacity,
a Christian can live a sinless life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            6. <u>Perseverance of the saints</u>
depends on the idea that when God regenerates the fallen abilities of people,
he does it effectually. If a person is genuinely converted, the conversion will
last till the end. Any apparent case of falling from grace is taken to indicate
that the original conversion was not genuine or that it was backsliding rather
than apostasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            7. The doctrine of <u>infused grace</u>
teaches that a transformation occurs within the saved that enables them to
fulfill the will of God by their own now-increased ability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            8. Consequently, <u>interpretation</u> of
scripture gets affected because unregenerate minds cannot understand spiritual
things unless the Spirit enlightens those minds. That enlightenment does not
take place just by understanding the truth, but by upgrading the mental
equipment by which the understanding can come—or perhaps by implanting the
concepts <u>directly</u> in the mind rather than indirectly through the word. Enlightenment
occurs <u>during</u> proclamation more than <u>by</u> it, <u>parallel</u> to
scripture more than <u>through</u> it.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>35</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Besides affecting the process
of interpretation, the natural depravity concept leads readers to intrpret a
host of passages differently from what they apparently mean aside from reading
that concept into them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            9. <u>Bibliology</u>—word revelation in
general—may be adversely affected in correlation with the concept of natural
depravity coupled with depreciating the adequacy of word communication and a
negative higher critical view of scripture. Most Calvinists hold a high view of
scripture and prioritize special revelation, but Karl Barth has tried to make
up for the inadequacy of word revelation and a low view of scripture by a “high”
view of the work of the Holy Spirit. In this way, revelation ends up getting
identified with illumination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            10. <u>Illumination</u>, particularly for
the unbeliever, is not just the subjective experience of enlightenment that
corresponds with objective revelation. It is a supernaturally caused experience
on the occasion of revelation rather than a natural experience through the
agency of revelation. Enlightenment occurs parallel to proclamation, not
through it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            11. <u>Apologetics</u> may become an
essentially <i>post facto</i> enterprise because the unregenerate man cannot
appreciate evidence for the truth of the Christian message. Conversion is a
supernatural operation more than a response to evidence and influence that have
been directed to personal need. In such a schematic, Christian evidence moves
from a primary role to a confirmatory one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Canonicity</u> figures into the picture
differently as well. How a person recognizes which writings belong in the canon
of scripture is ultimately a subjective consideration. Historical, doctrinal,
and subjective considerations (in that order) are not adequate to establish
reasonable certainty about the origin of biblical materials. The people of God
intuitively recognize the voice of God that speaks in writings that are
normative for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Not only is special revelation unavailable
to sinners because they cannot accurately read it or hear it, as noted above,
but <u>general revelation</u> is unavailable as well. For theologians of this
persuasion, the witness of nature and conscience is usually considered
sufficient theoretically for giving a correct knowledge of the true God. The
depravity in man, however, vitiates that otherwise adequate basis for knowledge
about God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            12. Natural depravity broadens <u>pneumatology</u>
because it is the Spirit that performs the various supernatural acts that
reverse the effects of degenerate nature. In addition to the work not
occasioned by natural depravity, the Spirit must accomplish the <u>miraculous
regeneration</u> that enables conversion to occur. In Wesleyan thought, he also
performs a second definite work of grace that makes <u>entire sanctification</u>
possible so sinless living can result. His work includes <u>infusing grace</u>
and supernaturally <u>illuminating</u> the mind parallel to word revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            13. Practical areas are also affected by
the natural depravity concept. Depravity alters what are appropriate procedures
in pioneer <u>missions</u> work. Since unregenerate people cannot apprehend the
real import of general revelation, nature and experience cannot serve as a
foundation for introducing further truths made known in special revelation,
specifically those truths related to salvation through Christ. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Historically, the missionary enterprise was
hindered because if God wants the heathen converted, he will do it without our
help (quietism). Besides the misunderstanding of divine sovereignty in such a
sentiment, the reason this obvious falsehood seemed sensible is that depravity
must be overcome before preaching can do any good. If God decides to regenerate
any heathen, he will at the same time specially call someone to proclaim the
message to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            14. Similarly, <u>evangelism</u> in
previously penetrated ethnic groups is a matter of simply offering good news
without defense or argumentation, not simply because of the inherent power of
the message to convict the hearer but because unbelievers cannot respond to
preliminary apologetics based on reason, experience, nature, conscience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism can even degenerate into “getting
it said.” Since unbelievers cannot respond to argumentation and persuasion
anyway or even to the message itself, readiness is not something that can be—or
need be—enhanced. Propriety, quality of presentation, methodology, and the like
have no bearing on the “success” rate. It is unnecessary and even irrelevant to
take church growth principles into consideration. The point is simply to get it
said, because it is in connection with “saying it” that God has sovereignly
chosen to regenerate unbelievers so they can respond.<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>22</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            15. <u>Sexuality</u> in general takes on a
negative character because bodily drives are considered perverted. With this
notion have come <u>levels of sexual morality,</u> the lowest of which is
faithfulness in marriage, then celibacy in marriage after conversion, and
celibacy without marriage. Intertwined with this reconstruction is the doctrine
of <u>sex for procreation always</u>. This negative attitude toward sex
underlies much of the disdain for marriage, the <u>exaltation of celibacy</u>,
and the practice of <u>clerical celibacy</u>. It is likewise responsible for
the doctrine of <u>the perpetual virginity of Mary</u>, a notion that might be
forced into scripture but not something that arises from it. The <u>sex drive</u>
itself is depreciated to the point that no essential distinction remains
between a husband’s desire for his wife and a man’s lust for any woman; both
exhibit concupiscence. Augustine himself even theorized that if the fall had
not occurred, sexual relations would have been purely volitional acts aside
from desire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            16. Natural depravity impacts <u>Christology</u>
in a couple ways. First, when combined with other speculations, natural
depravity is used to explain the need for the <u>virgin birth</u>. Christ’s
incarnation would otherwise have been tainted by his being born through sexual
desire, that is, concupiscence. The idea is further elaborated by saying that
the male carries the defective genetic material related to depravity (see
DeHaan’s <i>Chemical Analysis of the Blood</i>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Depravity also reduces the power of the <u>incarnation</u>.
One may ask whether Jesus really identified with the human condition as man
must currently deal with it since Christ was not born with the hindrances that
we must handle. The incarnate Christ starts moving in the direction of the
docetic Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            17. The doctrine of <u>the immaculate
conception</u> grows out of the depravity concept as well. For Jesus not to be
born depraved, Mary needed to be born without depravity; that is, she was
immaculately conceived.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            18. Calvinists often object to speaking
favorably about <u>self-esteem</u>. Their pessimistic view of mankind makes it
seem inappropriate to encourage feeling good about ourselves or about what we
have done. We should glory only in what <u>God</u> does, what he has done <u>to</u>
us, and what he does <u>through</u> us. The point is not so much that in order
to glorify God we must depreciate man—although that does not always come
through very clearly; but that because of people’s innate, inherent sinfulness,
they should not think anything good about themselves, only something good about
themselves as regenerated and sanctified by God. Self-worth amounts to pride,
and self-interest equals self-centeredness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            19. In light of the natural depravity
concept, we must also ask the <u>theodicy</u> question. How can God be just in
holding us guilty for what we cannot help doing? God makes us in such a way
that we are genetically defective by birth, which makes us sin. We cannot avoid
sinning in the first place—even theoretically, and we cannot turn away from
sinning in the second place without regeneration. Responsibility and guilt must
lie at the point of decision, and we cannot act responsibly at that point
because we cannot make choices in spiritual matters. God becomes guilty for our
sin because he made us the way we are, which leads to the final observation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            20. Perhaps the most distressing
implication of natural depravity is its implication for <u>theology proper</u>.
Because of his <u>sovereignty</u> God supposedly cannot be considered unholy
for holding us responsible for what we cannot help doing. Sovereignty
degenerates into capriciousness, holy love degenerates into holiness plus
selective love—a contradiction of terms, and God starts taking upon himself the
nature of a principle or law more than the nature of a person. He starts
looking more like Allah than Yahveh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In so many areas, Calvinism tends to
operate in absolutes because it does not have a good feel for the interpersonal
construct in contrast to legal, natural, and metaphysical systems. Its
simplistic format is driven by the legal, natural, and metaphysical categories.
It is frankly an impersonal system that does not allow for the nuancing,
qualifying, reciprocating, compenetrating characteristics of interpersonal
relationship.</span></p>
