is one of several sections in Romans that have raised considerable controversy.
In this study we attempt to work out Paul’s meaning in terms of legal
imperfection in contrast to interpreting it in terms of humasn nature. Philosophically,
the <u>function</u> and <u>relationship</u> categories replace the <u>nature</u>
category. Theologically, <u>ethics and salvation replace anthropology</u> as
the central concerns. We propose to show that natural depravity is a concept
irrelevant to this text, if not false in itself.</span></p>

18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Two Means to Perfection</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Earlier in Romans Paul
labors to help his readers understand a distinction between what he calls “faith”
and “works,” code words for two formal means to a result in two different “systems.”
By <i>works</i> he means inherent result; by <i>faith</i> he means non-inherent
result.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> The result Paul is
concerned with is human righteousness, or to be more exact, being viewed by
another Person as having human righteous so that relationship between them can
exist. Inherent result applies to law while non-inherent applies to grace. Theoretically
under law (Mosaism), personal righteousness can come only from the person’s own
actions. The other Person views him as righteous because he <u>is</u> righteous
and gives him fellowship on that personal basis. Under grace
(interpersonalism), righteousness is not fully there, but the sinner trusts
(faith) the other Person to view him as righteous on the basis of his identity
with the One who <u>is</u> righteous (Messiah/Christ) and to give him
fellowship on that interpersonal basis. The sinner also trusts that Messiah’s
righteousness is the proper, adequate basis for the other Person can view him
as righteous likek the Messiah. Works as the direct cause of personal
righteousness clarifies what it means to be <i>“in bondage to sin” </i>(<b>7</b>:14-24)
and explains how a person <u>falls</u> into that situation (<b>7</b>:7-13). Faith
is useful for understanding the state of the believer under grace (<b>8</b>:17).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Two Problems with Imputed Perfection</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            After Paul declares that
everyone is lost (<b>1</b>:16-<b>3</b>:23) and shows the need for the “faith
system” in overcoming alienation from God (<b>3</b>:19-<b>4</b>:25), he lays
the foundation for that new system (<b>4</b>:25-<b>5</b>:19) and describes its
applications and benefits (Romns <b>5</b>:20-<b>8</b>:17). In this last section,
two questions come to Paul’s mind as soon as he declares that works under law
are not effective and that mankind needs to put faith in God’s grace. <u>Antinomianism</u>
is a problem on one side of the issue and <u>anti-Mosaism</u> is a problem on
the other. Antinomianism means that moral behavior has no decisive connection
with salvation. Anti-Mosaism is opposition to Mosaic legislation as divine
revelation about moral behavior. Jews falsely supposed that early Christians
were opposing the Law when they said God’s revelation through Moses was not a
permanent code for God’s people.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> Paul
makes his positive presentation in a way that keeps his readers from slipping
off into either false inference. Both points have a bearing on what he means in
Romans <b>7-8</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Antinomianism</u>. How
can Paul dispense with the Law without implying that it does not matter how a we
act? If actions have no meaning for salvation, does it not matter what we do: <i>“Shouldl
we continue in sin that grace may abound”</i> (<b>6</b>:1; cp. <b>6</b>:15)? Paul
answers that the intent behind providing a way of salvation is to get away from
the sin that leads to lostness. Bringing up antinomianism misses the point of
both law and grace because both deal with the sin problem. Furthermore,
observing that actions cannot themselves save us does not mean they bear no
relation at all to salvation. They may serve as conditions God lays down for
saving us through a system of non-inherent result (interpersonal process). The
antinomian issue relates to <b>7</b>:5-<b>8</b>:17 because <b>6</b>:16-23 follows
a rhetorical question to that effect, and what Paul answers there equals <b>7</b>:6;
<b>8</b>:1-17.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Anti-Mosaism</u>. How can
Paul dispense with the Law without saying there is something wrong with it? Can
he help casting aspersions on the Law by abandoning it in favor of another
system? <i>“Do we make the </i></span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Law</span></i><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> of none
effect through faith?”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<b>3</b>:31;
cp. <b>3</b>:1). No, because faith has the same purpose as law had—establishing
human righteousness and a person’s consewqurent relationship with God.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> <i>“Is the law sin?”</i> (<b>7</b>:7).
No, the problem is with us, not the Law that governs us. God’s Law is good (<b>7</b>:12-13,
16). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul shows in<b> 7</b>:1-4
how not being under law does not belittle law or move outside the spirit of the
Law into lawlessness. The question about the Law relates to Romans 7:5-<b>8</b>:17
because <b>7</b>:1-4 on the Law immediately connects with <b>7</b>:5-6, which
state respectively the alternatives of being under, and out from under, the Law’s
requirements. Verse 5 is elaborated in<b> 7</b>:7-24, and verse 6 is expanded
in <b>7</b>:25-<b>8</b>:17.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Without question legalism (<b>7</b>:5)
<i>vs.</i> antinomianism (<b>7</b>:6) is a framework of thought for Romans <b>7-8</b>.
Paul’s solution is that we are released from law as to the irreversible
consequences of disobeying it, but we are under law as a description of right
and wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Three Constructs Within Romans 7:5-<b>8</b>:17</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Three constructs lie in the
background of Romans <b>7</b>:5-<b>8</b>:17 and form a matrix in Paul’s
thought. (1) <u>This section must be interpreted in terms of the difference
between being under law and being under grace: Paul under Moses and Christ</u>.
What <u>faith</u> and <u>works</u> mean has been treated above, but we note
again that the distinction between them is relevant here. Not only (a) has that
distinction been a major theme in our essays; (b) the immediate context here<b>
</b>opens with dying to law as a way of looking at the change from Jew to
Christian. The comparison to a wife’s remarriage after a husband’s death is
especially significant because (c) it stands within the block of material that
urges Christians toward the implications of salvation for Christian living—a
section that includes at least<b> 5</b>:20-<b>8</b>:17. The section given
special attention here is not, then, the beginning of the topic in Paul’s
treatment. (d) Immediately after the analogy to marriage under law, Paul
applies that analogy to us under law (<b>7</b>:5) <i>vs.</i> not under law (<b>7</b>:6).
Romans <b>7</b>:5-6 summarizes <b>5</b>:20-<b>7</b>:4 and serves as a précis
for <b>7</b>:7-<b>8</b>:17. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (2) <u>This section must be
interpreted in terms of a parallel between Genesis 3 and Romans <b>7</b>: Adam
and Paul</u>. Several items are common to both chapters. “Knowing sin” sounds
like “knowing evil” (Genesis <b>3</b>:22). “Death” is the consequence of sin
(Genesis <b>2</b>:17; <b>3</b>:3-4, 19). There was a time when “I” had not
sinned, a time called being “alive.” “Beguiled” recalls Satan’s deception of
Eve (Genesis <b>3</b>:13; 2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:3; 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:14). “Desiring”
psarallels wanting the forbidden fruit. Lastly, the fallen situation is
irreversible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) <u>This section must be
interpreted in terms of a parallel between the history of the human race and
the life of Paul: Mankind and Paul</u>. (a) Being <i>“alive apart from the Law
once”</i> (<b>7</b>:9) does not derive from the context of the Garden
particularly because there was never a time when the first couple were apart
from law as God’s commandment. The commandment did not “come” to them after a
time of ignorance. The revelation to Israel through Moses, however, does
correspond to this part of Paul’s thinking. (b) Paul has referred to the coming
of the Law through Moses in Romans <b>5</b>:12-14 and in <b>5</b>:20. The last
verse begins everything up to <b>8</b>:17 and ties back in the other direction
to <b>5</b>:12-14. A consistent progression of thought becomes evident with that
observation. Moreover, the coming of the Law through Moses appears in the
statement with Adam’s original act of sin (<b>5</b>:12-14). In his mind Paul
associated the Adamic Fall and the Mosaic Revelation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            So there are three related
comparisons behind Romans <b>7</b>:5-<b>8</b>:17: a comparison between the
history of mankind and the history of an individual man, a comparison between
the Fall of mankind and the fall of an individual man, and the contrast between
a man under law and under grace. Each person’s life partially recapitulates the
history of the human race (innocence to accountability), re-enacts the Fall of
the human race (accountability to sinfulness), and requires the change from law
to grace (sinfulness to righteousness).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Coming of Imperfection</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Knowing Sin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In <b>7</b>:7-13 Paul
explains how “I” got into the death predicament. He says first that his
knowledge of sin came through the Law. What <i>“knowing sin” </i>means
partially depends on how closely Romans <b>7</b> parallels Genesis <b>3</b>. If
Paul deliberately connects them, <i>“knowing sin”</i> means experientially
knowing sin, being actively involved in sin, as distinguished from knowing what
sin is definitionally. Before they sinned, Adam and Eve knew definitionally
what was right (caring for the Garden, populating the earth) and wrong (eating
from the tree of knowledge). So, <i>“mankind has become like one of us knowing
good and evil”</i> does not mean knowing definitionally what good and evil are,
but participating in evil as well as in good—knowing experientially.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In Romans <b>7</b>, then,
Paul does not intend (a) a statement on revealed ethic <i>vs</i>. innate (or
scientific) ethic.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> It is not
(b) that right and wrong do not exist where there is no standard (<b>4</b>:15),
nor that (c) God does not hold wrong action against us until he reveals to us
that it is wrong action (<b>3</b>:25; <b>5</b>:13).<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>6</span> (d) Neither does he mean, <i>“It hit me what the Law
really meant.”</i> Rather, (e) he would not have sinned had it not been for the
Law (cp. <b>3</b>:20). All these other ideas may be true, but the point here is
not so much an <u>objective</u> one, as in the first three; nor a <u>subjective</u>
one, as in the fourth; it is an <u>experiential</u> one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sin and Law</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The question raised here is
how the Law relates to “my” sin. The <u>coming of sin</u> to “me” parallels the
coming of sin to the human race in the beginning. The <u>coming of the
commandment</u> to “me” parallels the coming of the commandment to the human
race through Moses. Many commentators suppose that (a) the commandments and
prohibitions of the Law in themselves aroused perverse desires dormant in Paul.
Most comments to that effect arise from the natural-depravity presupposition
generally brought to the passage. Aside from depravity, there is some truth to
the idea that forbidding something draws more attention to it than not
mentioning it at all. Continually reprimanding a child for some habit tends to
crystallize that habit in him. Nevertheless, that kind of adverse effect seems
not to be Paul’s point here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The suggested interpretation
is that (b) the Law was the occasion temptation used to lead Paul into sinning.
<b>(1)</b> In the Fall, Genesis does not picture Adam and Eve as lusting after
the forbidden fruit after God forbade eating it. The <u>prohibition</u> itself
was not counterproductive. Their natural “desire” for food was misdirected by <u>Satan</u>,
who took “the law” as an occasion to tempt them into fulfilling their desires “unlawfullly.”
Likewise, in Romans the commandment was the occasion by which <u>sin</u> slew
Paul in the day that he partook thereof. God’s Law is then the occasion
temptation uses to lead people into sinning against God. Temptation does so by
taking a desire that is in itself wholesome and urging us to satisfy it in an
unwholesome—in a way that is contrary to God’s revealed Law. So the problem is
not the desire nor the Law, but temptation by other persons to get “me” to
satisfy that desire the wrong way. Law—and the desire itself, for that matter—are
the <u>occasion</u> that temptation uses to bring about sin. Once sin is
brought about, the sinner is “trapped” in legal imperfection (state),
psychological compulsion (behavior), and interpersonal alienation if nothing
but law and behavior bear on relationship to the Lawgiver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(2)</b> In the history of
our race, there was no formal law before Moses on the basis of which God
imputed sin (<b>5</b>:13). There were interpersonal covenant values (Genesis <b>9</b>:1-7).
In one sense an act is sinful whether a sinner knows it or not, but God has
adopted the practice of not holding sin against us if he has not revealed to us
that he considers it sinful. Under that construct sin definitionally speaking
was already in the world before sin revelationally speaking came into being. So,
sinful practices preceded the Law on the basis of which God held people guilty
for those sins. The comparison is that Paul’s sinful practice preceded the Law
on the basis of which God held him guilty. So, the coming of the commandment
merely provided the basis for God’s beginning to <u>impute</u> to him what he
had already been doing before the commandment came. The conclusion is that the Law
relates to the sin of a man like Paul, not as cause to effect, but as occasion
to effect. The commandment itself is holy, righteous, and good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That understanding of Paul’s
thought is reinforced by the Jewish practice of celebrating <i>bar-mitzvah</i>.
Previous to about twelve years of age, the Jewish boy was taught what God expected
of him as a member of the Jewish nation. In <i>bar-mitzvah</i> he formally came
under the Law by becoming a <i>“son of the covenant.”</i> It meant the
personal, active acceptance of the Law under which he had automatically and
passively been placed by birth. Its functional equivalent is first communion
and confirmation in magisterial churches and roughly corresponds in time with
the age of accountability in the free-church traditions (baptism). Those acts
formalize into a point what in many respects is a process. Paul treats as a
point in time what must have had elements of process over time since he could
hardly specify an exact moment when the commandment “came” to him. In effect, <i>bar-mitzvah</i>
was not a coming into life, but into death: <i>“When the commandment came, sin
sprang to life, and I died.”</i> <i>Bar-mitzvah</i> was the occasion of “the
evil impulse.” The coming of the commandment was the occasion of the effect.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(3)</b> The placement of <i>“through
the commandment”</i> in <b>7</b>:8 and 11 may support the second way of viewing
the relationship between law and sin. Is it, <i>“But sin, taking occasion
through the commandment, worked in me all lust,”</i> or is it, <i>“But sin,
taking occasion, through the commandment worked in me all lust”</i>? Does <i>“through
the Law”</i> modify <i>“taking occasion”</i> or <i>“worked in me”</i>? The
latter leaves the reader hanging as to what “occasion” means, so the other
seems preferable. In <b>7</b>:5 Paul does not mention <i>“occasion,”</i> but
states in shorthand fashion that <i>“sinful passions . . . [were] through the Law.”</i>
Regardless of the grammar, the sense is that sinful passions are through the
influence of temptation in connection with the prohibitions of the Law. The <i>“passions”
per se</i>, we add, are not themselves sinful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since the Law was only the
occasion for sin, Paul does not blame the Law (<b>7</b>:12) or question God’s
motives in giving it. <i>“Did <u>good</u> become death to me? Certainly not. But
<u>sin</u>, that it might be shown to <u>be</u> sin, [became death to me] by
working death to me <u>through</u> good” </i>(<b>7</b>:13; cp. <b>5</b>:20;
Galatians <b>3</b>:19). The evil of sin used the good of the Law to bring about
the evil of death. God did not <u>do evil</u> that <u>good might come</u> (<b>3</b>:8)
as if he gave the Law to get people “messed up” so they would have to look to
him for salvation. God intended the Law to be a source of life, not a stumbling
block for death (<b>7</b>:10; <b>10</b>:5; cp. Galatians <b>3</b>:12; Luke <b>10</b>:28;
see Leviticus <b>18</b>:5).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God’s <u>first motive</u> in
giving the Law was to define what people should do to have life (<b>7</b>:10). Since
people had already developed habitual patterns of life, the <u>second motive</u>
for giving the Law was to sensitize them to the fact that what they were doing
was sinful. That intent was not to make them stumble, but to show them that
what they were doing was stumbling. God made sin <i>“abound”</i> by putting those
actions into the sin category (<b>5</b>:20; cp. Galatians <b>3</b>:19). The <u>third
motive</u> for giving the Law was to make sin <i>“exceedingly sinful”</i> (<b>7</b>:13).
Sensitivity to sin is not simply an increased awareness of right and wrong, but
our realization that we stand under a condemnation that leads to despair, which
in turn leads us to Christ (<b>7</b>:14-25). By attaching the death penalty to
the im perfection, God showed how flagrant infractions of his commands really are.
Since the punishment is commensurate with the crime, heavy penalty indicates
serious offense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Meaning of <i>Death</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God intended his Law to give
us <i>“life”</i> (<b>7</b>:10) by regulating our behavior, bringing us within God’s
purposes, and so giving us <i>“meaningful existence” </i>through relationship
with God and his purposes. But in practical effect, temptation relative to that
Law resulted in <i>“death.”</i> Although Paul uses <i>dead</i> and <i>death</i>
with more than one meaning in this context, he does not mean (1) <u>physical
death</u> when he says, <i>“I died</i>,<i>”</i> but something that resembles
it; because in <b>7</b>:1-4 he compares physical death to the topic at hand. That
comparison shows that physical death is not his subject and that certain of its
features do fit his subject. The spiritual death he means might be death as (2)
<u>separation</u>—separation from God (death separates husband and wife) and
therefore meaninglessness (for a woman a dead man can no longer mean “husband”).
Separation from the Law means not being affected by the Law, as when someone
says, <i>“He is dead to the world.” </i>Death could be (3) <u>internal conflict</u>
(separation between intent and physical desire).  Death could also be (4) <u>irreversible

all these elements of death apply to the various usages of <i>dead</i> in the

interpreters see a shift from pre-Christian to Christian experience, especially
in the reformed tradition, which follows the explanation of the later
Augustine.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span> (1) A shift from
past to present tense occurs here, which implies a change to Paul’s current
experience. (2) On the presupposition of natural depravity, a non-Christian
would not want to do good, would not hate sin, not delight in God’s Law, or
serve him with the mind. (3) The struggle between intent and accomplishment is
so characteristic of the Christian life (<i>“the spirit is willing, but the
flesh is weak”</i>; Matthew <b>26</b>:41 = Mark<b> 14</b>:38). For an
unregenerate person there is no struggle. For a regenerate person the struggle
supposedly reflects the partial restoration from depravity that the Spirit’s
supernatural regeneration gives toward an unfallen condition. Regeneration is
not something that enables us to the point that we no longer struggle with
temptation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In response to the <u>third
point</u>, we overdo the sinfulness of sinners by asserting that for them there
is <u>no struggle</u> for moral attainment. Non-Christians are not perfect, of
course, but that does not justify making them all out to be worse than they are
(or, for that matter, that they all are worse than any Christian). They need
Christ because they are not perfect, not because they are perfectly evil. Paul’s
point is not <u>how</u> sinful sinners are, but <u>that</u> they are sinful. Being
sinful at all means they need Christ. Being sinful at all means that they need
more than a definition of right and wrong. At a more general level, being
sinful at all means they need interpersonal factors applied to their
circumstance—grace for faith. During his days as a Pharisee Paul claims to have
achieved a rather enviable level of legal morality (Philippians <b>3</b>:6-11).
Though he was “blameless” (in a loose sense, of course), he was not perfect (<b>3</b>:12-16).
For that reason he told the Philippians that he needed to keep growing. <i>“Having
Christ”</i> released Paul from the necessity of total success in his struggle,
which freed him up to keep trying to bring about in his behavior (actual
righteousness) that for which Christ had <i>“laid hold of him”</i> (reckoned
righteousness). From a practical—and especially a theoretical—standpoint,
perfectionism stifles and unnerves. We do not do as well as we would if we were
not “trying so hard.” “Trying too hard” is like absolutely <u>having</u> to hit
both foul shots or lose the game. Some “good moral men” appear to strive as
hard to do good as many of us regenerate Christians do. Paul was a previous <u>Jew</u>
who had attained a notable level of moral quality; yet he needed Christ. In
Romans <b>2</b>:14-15, Paul speaks even of <u>Gentiles</u> as doing by nature
and conscience what Mosaic revelation contained. Advocates of the depravity
position tend to overdo how sinful sinners are, which is not surprising if
depravity were true; but bringing in such an indictment here more reflects the
depravity position than argues for it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One seeming justification
for the tendency to exaggerate the sinfulness of non-Christians appears in some
of the Old Testament scriptures Paul cites earlier in Romans <b>3</b>:10-18
(Psalm <b>14</b>:1-3 = <b>53</b>:1-3; Psalm <b>5</b>:9; <b>140</b>:3; <b>10</b>:7;
Isaiah <b>59</b>:7-8; <b>36</b>:1). But these descriptions do not have to be
taken in the extreme for everyone. For a significant number of people, the
passages amount to exaggerations for emphasis. They are affective statements
that reflect the way we often feel about other people—Christians included—and
about ourselves when we fail miserably or sin significantly as David did in the
incident with Bathsheba (Psalm <b>51</b>; 2 Samuel <b>11-12</b>). Admittedly
there are many people of whom such statements are not exaggerations in the
least. But that is different from claiming that non-Christians as a class do
not struggle to do good. Romans<b> 3</b>:10-18 must be understood in harmony
with<b> 2</b>:14-15.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, the Christian
struggle is not <u>the kind of struggle</u> Romans <b>7</b>:14-24 presents. That
these verses hardly describe a Christian becomes more evident when materials in
chapter<b> 6</b> and <b>7</b>:5 combine with <b>7</b>:14ff. (a) A Christian is
not properly, or at least fully, described as someone in bondage to sin. In
7:14 Paul says, <i>“I am carnal, <u>sold</u> under sin”</i> (cp. <b>7</b>:13). In
<b>7</b>:24 he cries out to Christ for deliverance from his <u>captivity</u>. Similar
language expresses the pre-Christian experience in<b> 6</b>:16-23, where Paul
refers to his readers as previously <i>“servants of sin”</i> (<b>6</b>:17, 19,
20). He does so in the past tense, which contrasts with the present <i>“servants
of God</i>,” <i>etc</i>. (<b>6</b>:22). They were not Christians when they
served sin; they are Christians now that they serve God. <i>“We have died to
that wherein we were held” </i>(<b>7</b>:6). <u>The Christian struggle is not a
struggle in a context of bondage</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (b) A Christian is not
properly described as someone who <i>“brings forth fruit unto death”</i> (<b>7</b>:5):
<i>“What fruit then did you have at that time with respect to the things you
are ashamed of now, because the end of those things is death?”</i> (<b>6</b>:21).
A Christian’s fruit is <i>“unto sanctification and in the end eternal life”</i>
(<b>6</b>:22). The “I” in chapter <b>7</b>, however, amounts to one who brings
forth fruit unto death in that a law works in his members in a way that puts
him where he needs to be delivered from death (<b>7</b>:24). <u>The Christian
struggle is not one that leads to death</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (c) A Christian is not
properly described as someone that lives in despair, crying, <i>“Wretched man
that I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?”</i> (<b>7</b>:24).
We have not received a spirit of bondage again unto fear, but a spirit of
adoption (<b>8</b>:15). We do not cry out, <i>“Wretched man that I am,” </i>but
<i>“Abba, Father.”</i> That deliverance is a present possession received by
those who have identified with the resurrected Lord through the resurrection of
the new man in baptism (<b>6</b>:1ff.). <u>The Christian struggle is not a
struggle that produces despair</u>. No one denies that Christian living
involves struggle; Paul buffeted his body daily to bring it into subjection (1
Corinthians <b>9</b>:27). But the struggle is not one of bondage to sin, fruit
unto death, and a sense of despair.</span></p>

point</u>, the change of tense at <b>7</b>:14 does not require a shift to

might be using a literary device as he does elsewhere (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:12,

likely here. More to the point is the fact that Paul’s topic is salvation,
which applies to everyone including Paul.<span style='position:relative;

grace Paul contemplates his present experience aside from the benefits of
grace. He views the Jewish state from the Christian perspective. That accounts
for the present tense and avoids the artificialness of saying that Paul is
talking about something purely hypothetical. Since <b>7</b>:14-24 applies to
Christians, it describes a present, real experience from Paul’s standpoint. Insofar
as it does not fully or properly describe Christians, it might be called
hypothetical. Romans <b>8</b>:1 describes the other aspect of the total
Christian experience. As a splice verse <b>7</b>:25 combines spiritual
aspiration and “fleshly” drag on it. Christ makes up the difference; or, to put
it more abstractly, interpersonal processes make up the difference between
personal performance and legal perfection, actual living and ideal expectancy.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

interpretation are the same as (1) the exegetical observations given above
against the reformed interpretation. There are features in<b> 7</b>:14-24 that

silent about Christ and the Holy Spirit, elements supplied in <b>7</b>:25-<b>8</b>:3
and<b> 8</b>:4-17 respectively. (3) Nothing beyond a Jewish person under law is
necessary for understanding chapter <b>7</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The reason <b>7</b>:14-24 <u>applies</u>
to grace, but does not <u>describe</u> grace, is that law and gospel are not
parallel categories except as bases for relationship to God (soteriologically).
Moses and Christ are not discontinuous divine economies (<b>3</b>:31,<i> etc</i>.).
They have a common purpose and a common “holy history,” the former preparing
for the latter (7:<b>14</b>-24) and the latter fulfilling the anticipations of
the former. Formally they relate as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Instead of two separate circles, they
are two overlapping ones. Both law and grace have distinctive features (A, C)
as well as common ground (B). Law (<b>7</b>:14-24) and grace (<b>7</b>:25-17)
are the same as to perfection standard and the struggle to attain it; so <b>7</b>:14-24
does not <u>describe</u> Christians even though some aspects of the description

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

under “law” (B) <u>definitionally</u> and “<u>demandingly</u>.” God defines
right and wrong for them and requires perfection just as surely as before. The <u>means
to perfection</u> is the main thing that has changed. Under law, perfect
righteousness is by works (A); under grace it is by faith (C). As a consequence,
there are opposite implications (A, C) for the struggle (B) common to those
living under either system. God’s Law always (B) requires death for sin
(alienation for disobedience). Since all people sin, the struggle under law (A)
leads to death, bondage, and despair. Serving the Law in effect meant serving
sin (<b>7</b>:25). Since all people in Christ stand uncondemned (<b>8</b>:1),
their struggle (C) leads to life (<b>8</b>:11), freedom (<b>8</b>:21), and hope
(<b>8</b>:24-25). Christians are <u>subject</u> (<b>8</b>:7) to God’s “Law”
(B), not <u>captive</u> to it (A). Being under Christ and being under Moses are
the same (B) <u>ethically</u><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11</span> and

experience described in <b>7</b>:14-24 does not have to be a Christian’s
struggle because it can be that of a regenerate Jew; so regenerate-unregenerate
does not belong to the discussion. (b) Christianity <i>vs.</i> Mosaism is not
distinguished by moral struggle; so chapter <b>7</b> <u>is relevant to</u>
Christians as to the fact of the struggle, but it <u>does not describe</u>
Christians in that struggle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Paul views the situation
under law from his Christian perspective, not as something he looks back on,
but as something he looks out from in his present position minus the benefits
of Christ. </b>He describes the legal circumstance (commandments and works)
minus interpersonal factors (grace, faith, and identity with the Righteous
One). This understanding is preferred over the one that looks back for four
reasons. (1) As a Jew, Paul would have spoken confidently, not despairingly, of
his place before God: <i>“. . . as touching the righteousness that is in the Law,
found blameless” </i>(Philippians<b> 3</b>:6; cp. Galatians <b>1</b>:13-14; 2
Corinthians <b>11</b>:21-22). (2) As a Jew he did not see the ineffectiveness
of animal sacrifice provided by the Law. Imperfections in his works were made
up for by offering a sacrifice that balanced the books, a sacrifice being
something he could give <u>in addition to</u> himself to make up for what he
lacked <u>in</u> himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) Jews seem not to have
perceived that Mosaic righteousness required perfection, but conceived of
righteousness as a preponderance of good deeds over evil ones. (4) Contemporary
Judaism concerned itself more particularly with matters that could be
quantified than with qualitative motivation. Jesus continually denounced the
Pharisees for getting “hung up” on such things and leaving undone the really
important things like mercy, justice, love. Paul also wanted his Roman readers
to turn aside from the traditional misemphasis on the measurable letter of the Law
and serve God in the qualitative spirit, or purpose, of the Law. Perhaps for
this reason he centers his discussion around the abbreviated form of the tenth
commandment: <i>“Do not covet.”</i> Coveting is a general covert attitude in
contrast to several other items in the Decalog that deal with specific overt
actions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In conclusion, Romans<b> 7</b>:14-24
does not properly describe a Christian, but it describes a Christian
contemplating his situation without the benefits of Christ, which amounts to
describing a Jew. But it is a description that only a Christian would give. Jews
did not really realize the predicament they were putting themselves in by
taking a purely legal approach to relationship with God. However, when a person
(a) sees that the Law requires moral <u>perfection</u>, (b) realizes that <u>death</u>
is the consequence of not actually living up to that impractical standard, and
(c) understands the <u>ineffectiveness of animal sacrifice</u> to make up for
failures under such a standard, the only possible reaction is psychological
bondage and emotional despair. Jews did not realize their predicament mainly
because they did not have the Christian experience for contrast.</span></p>

statements represent the purely logical movement within law and grace. They do
not include modal and qualitative distinctions in those movements. In the first
process, the mode of production is inherent result: sin produces death because
a sinful act itself breaks perfection. In the second process the mode of
production is non-inherent result: the aspiration for righteousness (implied by
identification with the righteous Messiah) only meets the interpersonal
condition on which God grants life. The third situation goes beyond the scope
of Romans <b>8</b> because Paul does not specifically address the struggle. It
must be remembered from Romans <b>7</b> (or brought in from Galatians<b> 5</b>:17-18;
1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:27; cp. 1 John<b> 1</b>:8-10). The second and third
processes presuppose the state of acceptance made possible by Christ. In all
three, <i>“flesh”</i> is equivalent to <i>“body”</i> (<b>6</b>:6; <b>7</b>:24; <b>8</b>:13),
<i>“passions” </i>(<b>7</b>:5), and even <i>“members”</i> sometimes (<b>6</b>:13,
19; <b>7</b>:5, 23). The <i>“human spirit”</i> (8:16) is equivalent to <i>“mind”</i>
when used alone (<b>7</b>:23) and to <i>“inward man”</i> (<b>7</b>:22). Finally,
<i>“death” </i>covers two related matters: the irreversible bondage inherent to
legal imperfection and the practical bondage that may be called habit
(psychological). Before discussing this last point, we must say some things
about Paul’s use of the word <i><u>flesh</u></i>.</span></p>

correlates with the reason he chose the term. In <b>7</b>:5 he speaks of sinful
passions; in <b>7</b>:7-8 he refers to the tenth commandment: <i>“Do not covet.”</i>
In the last half of chapter <b>7</b> we understood <i>“knowledge”</i> on the
background of the Fall to mean experiential knowledge. The inference is that
Paul uses <i>“sinful flesh” </i>(<b>8</b>:3) and <i>“sin”</i> personified (<b>7</b>:8-9,
11, 14, <i>etc.</i>) to mean flesh functionally, not flesh naturally. Therefore,
he does not mean that the stuff <i>“flesh” </i>is materially evil as in
Gnostic/Manichean dualism, or that it is formally evil by disorder relative to
a pristine state as in Augustinianism. Rather, he means that <i>“flesh”</i> is
experientially sinful in accordance with meaning <i>“knowledge of sin”</i>

not naturally sinful. <i>“Flesh”</i> is used <u>experientially</u>.</span></p>

self-centered behavior that correlates formally with the desiring of the flesh.
Thirst is quenched by taking something into the flesh from the outside. The
same is true of the other bodily drives. The flesh finds satisfaction only when
something is directed in toward it, as distinguished from finding fulfillment
by directing itself outward toward something else. Satisfying the flesh has an
outside-to-inside pattern, the same pattern that coveting has.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

with the mind/spirit/will the fulfillment of physical desires in conformity
with the moral norm, we have broken the perfection that law requires. The
decisive factor here are the physical drives that are not restrained by the
mind and directed into a suitable manner of satisfaction. That decisive factor
gives name to a state defined relative to law as imperfection; Paul calls it <i>“being
in the flesh”</i> (<b>7</b>:5). By nature, imperfection is irreversible. <i>Death</i>
is Paul’s term for irreversibility, or <i>“bondage.”</i> Bondage is bondage to
the penalty of law contrary to which we assuage physical desires. Theoretically,
one sinful act is all that is necessary for that legal consequence, as even the
Fall account witnesses (cp. also James <b>2</b>:10. That bondage called <i>“being
in the flesh”</i> is equivalent terminology for irreversibility. Furthermore,
the appropriateness of flesh terminology for what is also set forth in death
terminology is because flesh dies. <i>Flesh</i> is used <u>legally</u>.</span></p>

reasoning that explains the appropriateness of Paul’s flesh terminology for <u>legal
bondage</u>, we can understand <u>practical bondage</u> in flesh terminology
also. Practical bondage we have called “habit.” A habit is a learned pattern of
behavior that becomes increasingly automatic as a function of time and degree
of indulgence. A habit is learned behavior, not inherited defect. It is changed
the same way it is brought about—by interpersonal influence to alter <u>action</u>,
not by miraculous force to change being. Death as legal bondage is being <i>“in
the flesh”</i>; death as practical bondage is walking <i>“after the flesh”</i>
(<b>8</b>:4;<b> 6</b>:2). Legally, Christians are not <i>“in the flesh”</i> (<b>8</b>:9);
so practically, they ought not walk <i>“after the flesh”</i> (<b>8</b>:4). Instead,
they are legally in Christ (<b>8</b>:1) and walk practically <i>“after the
spirit”</i> (<b>8</b>:4). <i>Flesh</i> is used <u>practically</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Besides the law-flesh-death
cluster of terms, there is a cluster of spirit expressions: spirit of the law,
human “spirit,” Holy Spirit. That set of phrases raises two questions: (a) does
<i>spirit</i> means human spirit or Holy Spirit and (b) what is meant by <i>spirit
of the Law</i> <i>vs.</i> <i>“letter of the Law”</i>? To the first question we
may say that our spirit and God’s Spirit correlate in contrast to flesh and
Satan (sin, tempter). In unclear cases, we need not decide which is meant. It
seems most natural, though, to take <i>spirit</i> in the lower case when it
contrasts to flesh, and in the higher case when it contrasts with mankind. Flesh
is one aspect of us; so we expect what it contrasts with another aspect of us—our
spirit rather than the Holy Spirit.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12
</span>The hermeneutical “law of contrast” implies that contrasted items are at
the same level within a common larger category. Since <i>“flesh”</i> is within
the category “individual man,” we expect <i>“spirit” </i>to be within the same
larger category “individual man.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As to the spirit <i>vs</i>.
the letter of the Law (cp. 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:4-6), we set aside several
alternatives in favor of one that correlates with the rest of the spirit
cluster. The rejected ones are figurative <i>vs.</i> literal (Origen), personal
<i>vs.</i> written (Sanday), gracious <i>vs.</i> legalistic (Luther), internal <i>vs.</i>
external (Calvin). We chose the contrast between purpose and nature. The spirit
of something is some invisible aspect of it. The spirit of the Law is its
purpose, or intent: human righteousness. The letter of the Law means the
precise way by which law achieves that human righteousness: inherently
producing it through continuous obedience to its every command (Galatians <b>3</b>:9-14).
Some of the interpretations above are akin to this one, but they do not emphasize
the purpose <i>vs.</i> nature of the Law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            At last we can attempt to
state the mode of the Holy Spirit’s interoperation with the human spirit in
putting to death the deeds of the flesh (<b>8</b>:13; <b>6</b>:6). <u>That</u>
is Paul’s central concern in this section: the process of sanctification. We
must combine two points to elucidate the nature of the Christian struggle: (1)
the nature of a Christian’s state of acceptance; and (2) the nature of
practical sin as habit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our state of acceptance in
the Beloved means that God no longer looks on us with a “frown,” but comes to
us with “open arms” in the person of the Holy Spirit, who is <u>present</u> and
<u>loves</u> us. We are always more productive and successful when other people
are present and interested than when we are alone. We are always more
productive and successful in an atmosphere of love, acceptance, and
encouragement than in a climate of rejection. We more often win in our
struggles when we have the “home court advantage.” We know about the presence
and love of the Spirit, not by direct <u>perception</u> (Judges <b>16</b>:20),
nor necessarily by supernatural <u>products</u>, but by <u>promise</u> and
indirect “perception” through God’s people. The degree of help that comes from
the Holy Spirit is therefore in direct proportion to the level of our conscious
awareness of his Invisible presence. The level of awareness is affected by
activities and relationships that help us focus on the Unseen—<u>fellowship</u>
with those of like awareness who demonstrate the same love the Spirit has. The
experience of God is mediated through people who possess the divine attributes
of presence and love. <u>Bible reading</u>, <u>prayer</u>, <u>worship</u>, <u>meditation</u>,
<u>the Lord’s supper</u> are other activities that raise our level of
God-consciousness and consequently increase the “power” to conquer sin as
habit. That is how a Christian’s state of acceptance benefits him.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Secondly comes the nature of
practical sin as habit. If sin is habit, then what we need to curb and subdue sin
are those things by which we break habits. Sin is not the loss of some aspect
in our being as in natural depravity, so its solution is not through <u>miraculous
power</u>. Sin is an action we do; hence, its solution is through <u>interpersonal
power</u> from motivational strength supplied by interpersonal influence. That
kind of positive power exists between one person and other people and the Holy
Spirit. Both Satan and the Holy Spirit have their counterparts in people who
embody their characteristics, values, and behaviors. Interpersonal power
implies motivational power; the strongest motivational power is love; the
greatest lover is God; from his love no other person or thing can separate us (<b>8</b>:35-39;
cp. John <b>10</b>:28-29).</span></p>

Romans <b>7-8</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

13, John Calvin appealed to 2 Corinthians<b> 3</b>:12-18 to illustrate the kind
of thing responsible for Paul’s statements in the Roman letter. In that appeal,
Calvin undermined his own system by correlating regenerate-unregenerate with
law and grace.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>13 </span>First is a
summary of his reasoning followed by an alternative solution and the
anti-depravity implication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In 2 Corinthians<b> 3</b>:12-28
Paul compares the veil Moses put over his face with the veil that lies over the
hearts of Jews when they read the Law. For Calvin this veil, being associated
with the hardened mind (<b>3</b>:14), meant that the Jewish heart was <u>insensible</u>
to the import of the Law—rather than <u>insensitive</u> to it. Only when a
person turns to the Lord is the veil removed and the heart becomes <u>sensible</u>
to the Law. In this way Calvin brought to Romans <b>7 </b>the
regenerate-unregenerate distinction. <i>“I died”</i> came to mean <i>“became
insensible to.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The apostle’s intent,
however, relates to the Jews’ lack of awareness that the Law demanded
perfection. They apparently reasoned that God could not have meant sinless
perfection when he required holiness because such would not be possible. The Law
described an ideal, not a required achievement. They took the actual
requirement to mean what was possible for a person to do from a practical
standpoint, rather than what he ought to do from an ideal one. They substituted
practically perfect for actually perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God’s holiness is his
perfection, which is also his glory, a glory that the Law demanded of a person:
absolute perfection. In that all have sinned, none are perfect. They all <i>“fall
short”</i> of God’s glory (Romans <b>3</b>:23) by being “less than” holy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In light of that thought,
Paul’s analogy in 2 Corinthians takes on a different significance. As the veil
over Moses’ face reduced the glory of his countenance to a level tolerable to
their sight, the veil over their heart reduced the glory of the Law to a level
tolerable to their insight. Jews reduced that glory by substituting practical
perfection for absolute perfection and by supposing that animal sacrifice was
actually effective. These sacrifices were for individual <u>sins</u>, however,
not for <u>sin</u>, that is, not for removing a person from his sin status
(Hebrews <b>10</b>:1-4). Their practical presupposition prevented them (<i>“hardened
their minds”</i>; <b>3</b>:14) from beholding barefaced the glory of the Lord
into whose image they were to be transformed (<b>3</b>:18). When a person turns
to see the Lord, who is gloriously perfect, and realizes that he is to be as
holy as the Lord is holy, the veil that dims the glory of the Law’s demands is
removed (<b>3</b>:16). His mind allows the Law to say to him what it really
means because his mind also sees that the impossible demand it makes is taken
care of in the person of Christ. The perfection standard is made tolerable by
interpersonal considerations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Jews drew that pragmatic
veil between themselves and the Law because it had not been revealed to them
that Messiah would remove it (<b>3</b>:14) in such a way that they could look
on the full glory of the Law in its demands (<b>3</b>:7-11) and yet not cry
out, <i>“O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this irreversible
state of imperfection?”</i> The answer is, <i>“Messiah.”</i> There is no
condemnation to them that are in him (Romans <b>7</b>:25; <b>8</b>:1). So then,
the Law had a glory by virtue of the <u>perfection</u> it required of people to
make them like their glorious God, but Messiah has greater glory than his Law
by making it possible for <u>imperfect</u> people to look barefaced at that
demand without being driven to real and psychological destruction—death (2
Corinthians <b>3</b>:7-11). Not only does Messiah demand perfection, but he
goes beyond law in making perfection possible for imperfect people when they
identify with and commit themselves to him, his lordship, purposes, and values.
It is a “reckoned” based on the intent of the heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            What Calvin mistook for an
anthropological indictment is really an exegetical indictment. The point then
is not that the mind is hardened because the heart is <u>insensible</u>, but
that the mind is hardened because the heart is <u>insensitive</u>. The heart is
<u>insensitive</u>, not because it is <u>insensible</u>. <u>Insensitivity</u>
can be caused by other than an <u>inability to sense</u>. Insensitivity to the Law’s
demand for perfection was caused by the supposition that God could not mean
absolute perfection because that was not possible even before there was sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Either Calvin is
inconsistent in applying regenerate-unregenerate to Romans<b> 7</b> or natural
depravity is not true. In Calvinism the regenerate-unregenerate distinction
necessarily correlates with the saved-lost distinction. By appealing in Romans<b>
7</b> and to 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>, Calvin effectively correlates the
gospel-law distinction with the regenerate-unregenerate distinction. The
inference is that either there were no saved people <u>under</u> (not <u>by</u>)
the Law system, or depravity is not true. Since there were saved people during
the law system, we conclude that Calvinistic depravity is not true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the introductory
framework of thought, we differentiated two means to perfection: <u>works</u>,
which produce inherent results in the legal setting; and <u>faith</u>, which
meets conditions in an interpersonal setting for receiving non-inherent
results. The faith system means neither antinomianism nor anti-Mosaism. To
avoid these extremes, Paul combines in Romans <b>5</b>:20-<b>8</b>:17 a
recapitulation of human history (innocence to accountability) and the Fall of
the human race (accountability to sinfulness) to elucidate the change from law
to gospel (sinfulness to righteousness).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In<b> 7</b>:7-13 the Law was
the occasion temptation used through the flesh to produce death as irreversible
separation from God. Paul then describes in <b>7</b>:14-24 from his Christian
perspective the actual dilemma of a sinful person under Jewish Law. In <b>8</b>:1-17
he depicts the Christian life, where the letter of the Law has been met through
Christ and the spirit of the Law is met through the interpersonal power that
comes from the love and presence of the Spirit. Instead of crying out in a
state of rejection, <i>“Who will deliver me?” </i>a Christian cries out in a
state of acceptance, <i>“Abba, Father.”</i> As legal imperfection produces a
sense of rejection and separation from the Person who wrote the Law, so
gracious perfection creates a sense of acceptance and fellowship with the
Person who gave the gift of belonging. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This whole context is
understandable in terms of the law-gospel variable. The regenerate-unregenerate
variable is both un­necessary and untrue. To understand Paul’s thought, we must
substitute Paul’s stative considerations for Calvin’s anthropological
postulations. In so doing, we set aside a seventeen-hundred-year-old approach
to Romans <b>7</b>:14-24 in favor of one that is more in keeping with apostle’s
intent.</span></p>

himself had to deal with that fear of disrespect for the <u>Law</u> and the <u>temple</u>

[= Mark <b>14</b>:58]; <b>27</b>:40 [= Mark <b>15</b>:29]; John <b>2</b>:19-21).
The same charges came up at the trial of Stephen (Acts <b>6</b>:11-14; <u>Moses</u>
and the <u>customs</u> Moses delivered). It lies behind the conference on <u>circumcision</u>
in Acts <b>15</b> and all the encounters Paul had with Judaizing teachers who
followed him into the Gentile territories trying to get Gentiles to become Jews
in the process of becoming Christians. That problem not only precipitated the
Jerusalem Conference and the circulation of letters later from church leaders
in Jerusalem (Acts <b>16</b>:4); it called forth the epistles to the Galatians
and Romans and several passages in 1 Corinthians <b>1-4</b>, 2 Corinthians<b> 3
</b>and other letters. Later, the Jerusalem temple riot, which led to Paul’s
four-year incarceration in Caesarea and Rome, resulted from the same things, <i>“This
is the man that teaches everybody everywhere against the <u>people</u>, the Law,
and this place . . . ”</i> (Acts<b> 21</b>:28ff.; cp. <b>24</b>:6 + 12; <b>25</b>:8).</span></p>

interpreters must keep in mind that he is not dealing with the impersonal
problem that someone’s behavior does not measure up to an abstract standard for
behavior. The behavior/sin/action problem is in route to a personal relationship
problem. He is concerned about the problem of personal behavior in connection
with interpersonal relationship. The lack of relationship to God is what
lostness is (<u>alienation</u>). Changing the behavior that affects
relationship is <u>conversion</u>. Overcoming that lack of relationship is <u>reconciliation</u>.
Having that relationship is <u>fellowship</u> with God. <i>Drawing near</i> is
the Hebrew writer’s expression for that stative and recurring result (<b>4</b>:16;<b>

3</b>:22 is somewhat ambiguous even though its main thrust is clear enough for
present purposes. We have already said that <i>“knowing/to-know good and evil” </i>does
not mean (1) intellectually or definitionally knowing about good and evil
because Adam and Eve had already known about evil through previous commands and
prohibitions; so <b>3</b>:22 must mean experiential knowing. However, it cannot
be (2) an experiential knowing of good and evil that describes their being like
God. A holy God does not do evil; so experientially <i>“knowing good and evil”</i>
is not <u>causally</u> connected with “becoming like one of us.” (3) <i>“Knowing
good and evil”</i> can be <u>temporally</u> or <u>circumstantially</u>
associated with <i>“becoming like one of us.” “Becoming like God”</i> exercises
autonomy to the exclusion of higher authority as shown by disobedience. It is
evil to become like God by becoming independent, because it denies our
subordinate position, our limited nature, and our responsibility role under the
true Authority. It is <u>evil</u> for what is not God to become totally like
God. Knowing <u>good and evil</u> means acting out our own decision about what
is good or evil. It means becoming “wise” like God (<b>3</b>:5-6), or supposing
that we are wise in doing so. After evil entered the picture, God removed the
tree of life to keep evil subordinate through death. What “caused” Adam and Eve
to become like God was autonomous behavior. They tried to become more like him
than they were supposed to be. They exercised choice in a sovereign way. They
used their personal capacity (image) in an “anti-interpersonal” fashion. That
was evil because it was contrary to the Autonomous One’s will and contrary to
the fact that they were not independent beings. In that light, <i>“becoming
like <u>one of</u> us” </i>may have a partitive sense—one acting without
reference to the others in the situation. Understanding <b>3</b>:22 depends on
the meanings of <i>“becoming like God”</i> (= becoming “wise” and acting
autonomously), <i>“knowing good and evil”</i> (= deciding for themselves what
was good and evil, which was an evil thing to do), and <i>“one of us”</i>
(acting self-ishly). </span></p>

revelation calls for or human nature requires.</span></p>

general, we say the ethical standards in the Mosaic Law and in Christ are the
same. One well-known exception within the Law <i>per se</i> (<i>vs.</i> the
non-legislative sections of the pentateuch) is the divorce law of Deuteronomy <b>24</b>:1-4,
which allowed divorce for any cause (Matthew <b>19</b>:3-12; cp. <b>5</b>:31-21,
<i>etc</i>.). Even here Deuteronomy is dealing only with the <u>civil</u>
legislation on divorce, not God’s full <u>moral</u> (interpersonal) expectancy
as implied by the commentary on marriage found in the creation account that
Moses also wrote (Genesis<b> 2</b>:24; Matthew <b>19</b>:7-8). Several other
regulations in the Law are hybrids of moral and civil or ceremonial matters. In
such cases, the transition to new covenant involves dropping certain specific
ways (civil) of handling moral matters. In such cases, only the principle comes
across into second covenant.</span></p>

a listing of the usages of <i>spirit</i>, see the “Glossary of Terms” under <i>spirit</i>.
Spirit terminology is quite diverse in scripture. The constant seems to be “invisible
reality.” (1) The <i>S/spirit-flesh contrast</i> appears in John <b>3</b>:3-15;
Romans <b>8</b>:1-17; Galatians <b>4</b>:21-31 + <b>5</b>:16-25 + <b>6</b>:8-10.
(2) The <i>spirit-letter</i> contrast appears in Romans <b>2</b>:27-29; <b>7</b>:6;
2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:1-8. (3) The <i>Spirit-Father/Son</i> contrast appears
in a number of places like John <b>14</b>:16. (4) A <i>spirit-real</i> contrast
shows up in 1 Corinthians <b>5</b>:3, where Paul says he is with the
Corinthians in <i>“spirit”</i> even though he is absent in body. (5) <i>spirit-soul</i>
contrast comes up in 1 Thessalonians <b>5</b>:23 and Hebrews <b>4</b>:12. (6) A
<i>spirit-man</i><u> contrast</u> exists in cases that mention evil spirits or angelic
spirits (Luke <b>24</b>:39). (7) The word translated <i>“spirit”</i> (<i>pneuma</i>)
refers to the <u>“wind”</u> in John <b>3</b>:8 (cp. related words </span><span
