exegesis between Calvinistic and non-Calvinistic interpreters largely because
no resolution can come at the level of individual passages that have
implications for anthropology. A few examples illustrate the problem.</span></p>

Psalm <b>51</b>:10 interprets Ezekiel <b>18</b>:31 or <i>vice versa</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In these passages God opens
the heart, the human messenger opens the heart, God opens the heart through the
messenger, and the hearer opens his own heart. Is it that the messengers speak
of God’s opening the heart because they do not want to take any credit that
belongs to the power in a message they did not originate, or is it because God
did something to the hearers’ heart while the messengers proclaimed the gospel?
Is it that the hearers speak of God’s opening their heart because they do not
want to take any credit for something they knew they would never have done if
God had not taken the initiative, or is it that he caused them to do something
they knew could never have happened from the sheer power inherent in the
message? Is the power of God exerted to enable the heart or to change the able
heart? Unless some principle is found for getting behind these dilemmas, the
process of interpretation is at a stalemate.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Proposed Solution</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In preparation for the
proposed solution to this impasse, some observations on Hebrew idiom may prove
helpful. (1) <u>Assigning a good activity to both God and man</u><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> in the examples above parallels
statements (2) <u>assigning bad activity to both Satan and man</u> in Acts <b>5</b>:3-4.
But Peter said, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Ananias, why has <u>Satan filled your heart</u> to
lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land? While it
remained, did it not remain your own, and after it was sold, was it not in your
power? How is it that <u>you have conceived</u> this thing in your heart? You
have not lied to men, but to God.”</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Something similar occurs between 1
Corinthians <b>7</b>:5 and James <b>1</b>:14, <i>“Do not deprive one another .
. . in order that <u>Satan</u> not <u>tempt</u> you because of your
incontinence.”</i> <i>“Each person is tempted when he is <u>drawn away by his
own lust</u> and enticed.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) <u>People’s activity is
assigned to Satan</u>. Almost immediately after blessing Peter for his Good
Confession, Jesus calls him “Satan” for objecting to the death of Christ: <i>“Get
behind me, Satan”</i> (Matthew <b>16</b>:23). Judas’ decision to betray Christ
is described as Satan’s entering his heart (Luke <b>22</b>:3; John <b>13</b>:2,
27).         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (4) <u>The same activity is
assigned to both God and Satan</u>. The Old Testament text says both that Yahveh
and Satan moved David to number the people (2 Samuel <b>24</b>:1 + 1 Chronicles
<b>21</b>:1). Satan and Yahveh are both said to have brought all kinds of
suffering and loss on Job (Job<b> 1</b>:6-<b>2</b>:3, 10 + <b>42</b>:11). In
the last days, the coming of the Lawless One is according to the working of
Satan, which is the same thing as God’s sending people a working of error (2
Thessalonians <b>2</b>:9-10 + 11-12). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (5) <u>Satan is said to do
good</u>. Paul called his thorn in the flesh “a messenger of Satan,” even
though it was given to help keep the Apostle humble (2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:7).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (6) <u>God is said to do
evil</u>. God is the one who makes people deaf, dumb, and blind (Exodus <b>4</b>:11).</span><sup><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>5</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> God
hardened the spirit of Sihon, king of Heshbon, so he would not let the
wandering Israelites pass through his territory (Deuteronomy <b>2</b>:30). Samson’s
interest in Delilah was from the Lord, who was seeking an occasion against the
Philistines (Judges <b>14</b>:4).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (7) <u>Satan and God are
said to undo each other’s activity</u>. God sows the seed Satan takes out
(Matthew<b> 13</b>:19 = Mark<b> 4</b>:15 = Luke<b> 8</b>:12). God gives
repentance to those whom Satan has taken captive (2 Timothy <b>2</b>:24-26).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (8) <u>A bad thing is simply
assigned to Satan</u>. People’s blindness to the gospel is Satan’s blinding
them to it (2 Corinthians<b> 4</b>:4). Paul’s not being able to visit the
Thessalonians is Satan’s hindering (1 Thessalonians <b>2</b>:18). Cares and
anxieties are Satan’s continuous attempts to devour people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (9) <u>People’s turning away
is God’s giving them up</u> (Romans <b>1</b>:21 + 24, 26, 28).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The upshot of all this is
that in the case of human action God does the good in the same sense that Satan
does the evil. Scripture often credits a person’s action to (a) <u>its ultimate
inspiring source</u>. A good example of this phenomenon is Philippians<b> 2</b>:13,
<i>“For it is God that works in you both to will and to do.”</i> Paul evidently
means that God is, and should be, the motivating source of their high resolves
so that their obedience does not depend on Paul’s presence.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6 </span>Scripture credits a person’s
action to (b) <u>the one who permits and ratifies it</u>. Surely human beings
are not mere pawns in the hands of supernatural contestants. Using the Satan
statements as a control on the God statements, we conclude that the Bible often
employs linguistic and theological mechanisms in expressing a point other than
the immediate impression an English reader may receive.<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>            </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>A principle is needed for transcending the deadlock
between certain pairs of passages. The hermeneutical program is to select
principles which do not produce interpretations that ultimately violate the
self-consistency of God. To put it differently, interpretations are to be
chosen that do not eventuate in the Great Dilemma. This method does not
guarantee correct understanding, but it eliminates a class of incorrect ones. In
the biblical study of mankind and salvation, it provides a method for working
with texts arrayed against each other by interpreters of opposite viewpoints. From
the theoretical standpoint, the above passages about Satan’s activity seem to
suggest directions the answer may take, and so a list of relevant linguistic
phenomena appears below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Streamlining causal distinctions</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Common speech does not
always distinguish the precise ways in which causes and effects relate to one
another. Since scripture was written for the people in the language of the
people, we can expect this “streamlining of causal distinctions” to appear in
scripture as well. Biblical writers were men with a strong God-consciousness,
which further accentuates the tendency to use “God talk.” Semitic language
usage speaks more loosely than modern English does;<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>7</span> so English readers must take care not to impose upon
biblical idiom an expectancy created by their own customs of language usage. Even
the evil that exists is God’s doing insofar as he is responsible for it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Much of the
Augustinian-Calvinistic understanding of mankind and salvation comes from
reading causal statements in unnaturally rigid and “literal” ways. This
practice fits with the tendency to consider in terms of the categories of
nature and law those matters that are functional and relational, or at least to
try to reduce them to these categories. The philosophical errors about the
relationship of nature and action create a determinism that gets applied to the
interpretation process. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Passages exhibiting such causal
streamlining are taken to mean that people cannot respond unaided to the
influence exerted on them by the message, by human circumstance, and by
interpersonal relationships. For example, John<b> 6</b>:37 says, <i>“All that
the Father gives me will come to me, and the one that comes to me I will
certainly not cast out.”</i> Giving people to the Son does not eliminate their
ability to come to the Son. The Father designed salvation to involve people’s
coming to the Son; and the Son, working with the Father, accepts them. In the
same chapter Jesus says that the <i>Father “is giving you the true Bread out of
heaven”</i> (<b>6</b>:32) even while he speaks of his own coming <i>“down from
heaven to do God’s will”</i> (<b>6</b>:38). Jesus was delivered by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God (Acts <b>2</b>:23) even though he
laid down his life of himself (John <b>10</b>:11-18).         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Causal distinction includes
the difference between <u>permissive and prescriptive will</u>. Prescriptive
will refers to what God originates and specifies. Permissive will refers to
what originates outside of God under his ratifying control. Divine
glorification, purposefulness, and security come under both modes of divine
will. People’s actions allowed by God may be called God’s actions in the
permissive sense. Since God is omnipotent, he can intervene and stop whatever
is contrary to his purposes. Everything that happens, then, happens only
because he allows it or causes it directly or indirectly. E. M. B. Green
comments that permission-prescription is not linguistically distinguished in
Semitic dialects.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Calvinism customarily reads
the will of God as prescriptive will. In place of permission-prescription as
used here, Calvinism has necessity and compulsion. Both necessity and
compulsion are prescriptive, however. Necessity forces action from within,
while compulsion forces it from outside. But the location of the origin for the
determinism is not the point; determinism itself is the point. Permission
allows choice between possibilities and initiation outside of God whereas it is
difficult to see how these possibilities can exist under necessity and
compulsion. The “raised up” passages provide a case in point. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Perhaps another way of
conceptualizing this matter of causal series is <u>direct and indirect
operation</u>. People are not able to come to the Son unless the Father draws them,
but the drawing is through the proclaimed word they learn. Right after saying
that no one can come except God draws them, Jesus says, <i>“No one can come to
me unless the Father who sent me draws him. . . . It is written in the
prophets, ‘And they will be taught by God.’ Everyone that has heard from the
Father and has learned comes to me”</i> (<b>6</b>:44). The person “cannot”
come, not because of inability but because of circumstance. He has not been
taught by God, but by someone else. People that believe ideas incompatible with
the Father’s are not going to be drawn to the Messiah he sent. Jesus’ comments
apply to the Messianic misunderstanding in first-century Judaism. Since
political, militaristic expectancies for Messiah erred from the Father’s
intentions, religious leaders were not going to be drawn to Jesus because he
showed no political aspirations. To be drawn by the Father, a person has to
appreciate the values and purposes of the Father. Whether these leaders had the
ability to change their expectations and respond to the Father’s Messiah, lies
aside from the content of this context. John <b>6</b>:37, 44 do not address the
doctrine of natural depravity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Hebrew idiom can speak of a
man’s begetting his distant descendant. “Son of” can refer to a distant
ancestor. This familiar set of expressions readily illustrates indirect action
spoken of in the form of direct action. On the road to Damascus, Jesus told
Paul that he was persecuting <u>Christ</u> (Acts <b>9</b>:5; <b>22</b>:9; <b>26</b>:14).
Whenever someone does good or bad to Christ’s followers, it can be said to be
done to Christ himself (Matthew <b>25</b>:40-45).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Romans <b>8</b>:29 is
commonly appealed to by non-Calvinists to argue against Calvinistic
predestination. Calvin taught that God ahead of time determined the eternal
destiny of all persons aside from any consideration of acts on their part. However,
Paul says in this passage, <i>“Whom he foreknew he predestined.”</i> Calvinists
typically pose a prior question, <i>“Foreknowledge of <u>what</u>?” </i>The
response is <i>“foreknowledge of <u>faith</u>.”</i> Another prior question is
then asked: <i>“How did the person get that faith?”</i> The Calvinist says that
God <u>gave</u> that faith to him. But again, a question must be asked, <i>“<u>How</u>
did God give him that faith?” </i>Paul answers that question later in the same
epistle, <i>“Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ” </i>(Romans
<b>10</b>:17, cp. 14). Faith comes when a person responds to the word he has
heard. This line of thought exemplifies the importance of distinguishing
elements in a causal series.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            From an omniscient viewpoint
the distinction between <u>purpose and result</u> tends to disappear especially
when combined with the prescriptive-permissive variable. Verbally blurring
purpose-result appears in John<b> 9</b>:3. Jesus explains that the blind man’s
condition was <i>“so the works of God would be made manifest in him.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> What had a permissive origin in
the outworking of natural causes became an occasion for glorifying the Father
through his Son’s miracle. God permitted natural processes to work themselves
out unchecked. The result was that Christ could heal the blind man to God’s
glory. The omniscient God knew ahead of time what natural processes would
produce in this man’s life; yet he did not prevent that result. God also knew
that Jesus would heal him. This time, <u>permitting</u> the blindness had the <u>purpose</u>
of letting Jesus heal him to the glory God. That is a different thing from
saying that God <u>made</u> him blind so Jesus could heal him to the glory of
God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Related to the
purpose-result distinction is a distinction between <u>chronological and
logical order</u> in association with the doctrine of divine prescience and
prior intention. <i>“As many as were ordained to eternal life believed”</i>
(Acts <b>13</b>:48). The ordination to eternal life chronologically preceded the
foundation of the world (Ephesians <b>1</b>:4; Revelation <b>17</b>:8), as it
did the kingdom prepared for the faithful (Matthew <b>25</b>:34), and the
laying of the basis for entering it (Revelation <b>13</b>:8). Calvinism,
however, makes these all logically before as well as chronologically previous. The
importance of saying that these Gentiles were ordained to life is that letting
them come to “the light” (Acts <b>13</b>:47) accorded with God’s prior
intention announced in Isaiah<b> 49</b>:6. Luke cites the passage to justify
offering the gospel to Gentiles when the Jews refused it (Acts<b> 13</b>:44-46),
lest offering the gospel to Gentiles be seen as a corroborative reason for the
Jews’ decision to disbelieve. Not only had God determined that they could come,
but in anticipation of their coming, had ordained them to eternal life. Consequently,
Luke indicates the propriety of turning to the Gentiles in the historical
proclamation of the gospel. Ordination was to eternal life, not to the ability
to have faith; so the ordination <u>correlated</u> with faith rather than <u>caused</u>
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Romans <b>8</b>:7-8 requires
a distinction between natural and circumstantial inability: <i>“The mind of the
flesh is enmity against God, because it is not subject to God’s law neither
indeed can it be; they that are in the flesh cannot please God.”</i> <i>“The
mind of the flesh”</i> is described in <b>8</b>:6a as <i>“death</i>.<i>”</i> Death
stands for that system of thinking which does not go beyond the realm of the
physical, the natural, and the temporal. It is a thinking pattern that is “separated
from God.” This system is antithetical to the “mind of the spirit” (<b>8</b>:5b),
which gives precedence to spiritual, supernatural, and eternal concerns. People
operating in the “mind of the flesh” cannot please God because their <u>system</u>
is opposed to God and contrary to God’s spiritual, supernatural, and eternal
purposes. They “cannot” be subject to God because they are in a system that “is
not” subject to God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Apostle is speaking here
of an inability to please God while operating in the system of the flesh. He
says nothing about a person’s inability to change systems. No sinner can please
God because even the good the sinner does comes from a circumstance of
imperfection, which is enmity against God and which cannot be escaped because
of the nature of imperfection. A similar point occurs in 1 Corinthians<b> 10</b>:21:
<i>“You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.”</i> The manner
of the inability is circumstantial, not natural. The inability lies in the <u>circumstance</u>,
not the <u>person</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

need to take care in dealing with the English word <u>cannot</u>.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span> That it does not necessarily mean
natural inability should be obvious from a usage like John <b>5</b>:19, 30, in
which Jesus says he cannot do anything of himself. It clearly means that <u>as
Son</u> he cannot do whatever he pleases and yet be <u>Son</u>. Therefore, when
the text says in the same context, <i>“How are you able to believe”</i> (<b>5</b>:44),
it can have the same circumstantial force. Seeking the glory of <u>other people
opposed to God</u>, people cannot believe unto receiving the glory of <u>God</u>.
Believing people and believing God involves two incompatible programs. We must
let go of the one to take hold of the other. Whether we can let go and take
hold of the other differs from whether we can take hold of the second without
letting go of the first. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1 John <b>3</b>:9 clearly
involves circumstantial inability, <i>“Whoever God begets does not sin because God’s
seed abides in him, and he cannot sin because God has begotten him.”</i> For
one thing, “does not sin” means does not sin characteristically. In addition,
the passage means that we cannot be characteristically sinning and have God’s
seed in us. Having God’s seed in us and not sinning characteristically are
coextensive. If the one is missing, so is the other. The circumstance is such
that having the seed eliminates having sin and <i>vice versa</i>. That poses a
different question from whether we can lose the seed, so to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            To this circumstantial class
also belongs Jesus’ comment in John <b>15</b>:5, <i>“Without me you can do
nothing.” </i>We must abide in Jesus before what we do will have any
significance attached to it relative to kingdom matters. If Jesus abides in us,
we will be producing the fruit of that abiding because we will be doing things we
<u>would not</u> be doing without Christ’s influence. Interpersonal influence
is not such that we have to move in the direction of that influence; neither
does it apply in a case where we <u>could not</u> do the desired act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

quotes Psalm <b>53</b>:3 as saying, <i>“There is no one that does good, no, not
a one.”</i> Doing good appears in the beginning of the section where Paul sets
forth perfect righteousness as the requirement for fellowship with a righteous God.
The Apostle takes <i>good</i> to mean perfectly good as in Jesus’ reply to the
rich young ruler, <i>“There is none good except God”</i> (Matthew <b>19</b>:17;
Mark<b> 10</b>:18; Luke <b>18</b>:18). Paul does not claim that every act of
even a sinner is tainted by egocentric motives. He means that no one has
reached perfect goodness. Such people cannot do <u>good</u>, although they may
do <u>a good</u>, as Jesus says again, <i>“ . . . you, being evil, give good
gifts to your children”</i> (Matthew <b>7</b>:11; Luke <b>11</b>:13).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10 </span>Being once in the state of
imperfection, they cannot do perfect goodness even though they can do good
things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            According to John<b> 6</b>:44
no one can come to the Son unless the Father draws him. What Jesus means is not
that a supernatural influence must regenerate a degenerate capacity. Rather, he
means that no one can come to him except on the Father’s terms. No one can come
to the Son except the <u>Father</u> is the one drawing him. Trying to come to
the Son on some other terms means that someone besides the Father would be
drawing him. People cannot establish the kingdom of God after their own
designs, political or otherwise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            After the feeding of the
five thousand (John <b>6</b>:1-4), a note appears that Zealot forces,
endeavoring to further their political purposes against Roman occupation, tried
to make Jesus their Messianic king (<b>6</b>:15). The next day a four-stage
confrontation takes place between Jesus and these rebuffed patriots. As an open
challenge to their concept of the Messianic kingdom, Jesus concentrated
attention on his identity with the Father’s will. Anyone coming to the Son must
be willing to adopt the Father’s purpose for his Son. Being drawn by the Father
of the theocratic king equals responding to his program rather than to someone
else’s—like their own. It also equals responding to the theocratic Son himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The political leaders were
not in the circumstance of being drawn by the Father because they were being
drawn by their own military idols and political ideals. Whether they could in
themselves to be drawn by the Father’s purposes differs from whether they were “able”
to be drawn by the <u>Father’s</u> purposes committed as they were to <u>their
own</u> purposes. The two programs being incompatible, these leaders could not
operate in the one while being committed to the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A cluster of images in the
gospels center around the concept that only good trees bear good fruit (Matthew
<b>7</b>:15-20; <b>12</b>:33-37; Luke <b>6</b>:43-45; cp. James <b>3</b>:1-12).
Calvinistic interpreters take such statements to mean that there is a <u>correlation
between nature and action</u>. A general correlation does exist, but it is not
a one-to-one correlation between nature and action. That would be determinism. The
metaphors indicate a <u>correlation between inner action and outer action</u>
inasmuch as the figures of speech are used in condemning hypocrisy. The inner
actions of how people think, feel, and intend, express themselves outwardly,
because outward behavior arises from inner motives. One person can see another’s
invisible motives by attending carefully to his visible actions. Watching “fruit”
may suggest long-term observation that can detect the inconsistent living of
studied hypocrisy. People sometimes try to cover up (Matthew <b>7</b>:15) their
real intentions by good talk (Matthew <b>12</b>:34) and attempt to sever the
connection between inner and outer action. It does not usually take long to “see
through” such people because daily life issues to a great extent from the
unconscious self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The word <i>create</i>
signifies the making of something new. Psalm <b>51</b>:10 says, <i>“Create in
me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”</i> Paul has a
similar statement in Ephesians <b>2</b>:10, <i>“ . . . created in Christ Jesus
for good works.” </i>The subject of these verses is purifying the heart,
cleansing from sin, being changed, being put in a new category. Only God can
pronounce us no longer guilty of a misdeed, because it is against God that we
sin. Creating a new heart is not remaking something marred but changing its
functioning and relationships. Creation in Christ changes relationship and
standing as a result of being pronounced holy. “Creating” does not renew a sinner’s
faculty or ability. People sometimes say, <i>“He makes me mad.”</i> The
expression does not mean passiveness, but responsiveness even though the idea
is cast in words that sound like the enraged person is passive. This is a
matter of <u>personal influence</u> that moves someone else to action, not a <u>natural
creativity</u>.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11</span> What is in
fact an action is stated in substantive terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God’s giving the Gentiles
repentance unto life (Acts <b>11</b>:18) requires a distinction between <u>state
and action</u>. Calvinists misapply the law of opposition at this point. The
context deals with the contrast between Gentiles and Jews, not with a contrast
between repentance as done <i>vs</i>. repentance as given. The Lucan expression
means that God offers eternal life to Gentiles as well as Jews on the condition
of repentance. God has made his repentance-unto-life possibility available to
them as well as to Jews.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> The
intent is not that God needs to give Gentiles the <u>ability</u> to repent, but
the <u>opportunity</u> to repent unto salvation through hearing the gospel. Repentance
is not a gift received as distinguished from something done, but an opportunity
given that has salvation value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ephesians <b>2</b>:8 in
English translation may appear to indicate that <u>faith</u> is given in such a
way as not to be from the person, <i>“By grace you are saved through faith and
that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.” </i>The word <u>that</u> is
grammatically neuter, not feminine, and cannot refer to the feminine word <u>faith</u>
as its antecedent. Instead, <u>that</u> points to the impersonal idea in the
verb: salvation. Salvation does not come from us; God gives it to us by viewing
us as righteous.</span></p>

rule, the Jewish people refused their Messiah, but thousands did believe. What

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This last linguistic
mechanism combines with others in the case of 1 Corinthians <b>2</b>:14, <i>“Now
the natural man does not receive the things of God’s Spirit, because they are
foolishness to him; and he cannot know them because they are spiritually
discerned.”</i> First, the reader must understand what Paul means by “natural
man.” “Natural man” does not mean “unregenerate man,” because the preceding
context is not discussing the fallen <u>nature</u> of people, but the <u>circumstance</u>
of people without a revelation of the mystery (1 Corinthians <b>2</b>:7). <u>Natural</u>
man refers to one unaided by revelation from the <u>super</u>natural through
the Spirit. Paul makes a similar use of <i>nature</i> in Romans <b>2</b>:14
when he speaks of people without revelation doing “by nature” the things in God’s
law. The origin of what they do lies within their own educated conscience as it
often leads them into behavior that God wants but they have not heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul has a similar thing in
mind in 1 Corinthians 2 since he is speaking of the mystery not known in the
world (<b>2</b>:7-9) and only recently revealed (<b>2</b>:10a). Human wisdom
could not discover the means of salvation, because it had no access to the mind
of God, who determined the foundation of salvation (<b>2</b>:8). People would
never have thought that a dead man could be the basis of salvation unto life. Such
a thing was foolishness to philosophers (<b>2</b>:8; <b>1</b>:18, 23) and a
stumbling block to Jews, who anticipated an eternal political Messiah (<b>2</b>:8;
<b>1</b>:22-23). Unless people have access to God’s mind, they cannot know what
God is planning (<b>2</b>:9-11) any more than one person can tell what another
is thinking. People know only their own thoughts. Likewise, only God (“the
Spirit of God”) knows his own thoughts till he reveals them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Because natural people are those
without access to supernatural revelation, they cannot know what such
revelation contains. The word <u>know</u> in the original is aorist and should
probably be taken as an ingressive aorist, “come to know,” since the preceding
material deals with the divine origination of this knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The mind of God is examined
by the Spirit of God and must be understood in reference to a spiritual system.
The Spirit puts God’s thoughts into human language. Things of spiritual origin
expressed in human words can carry spiritual content (1 Corinthians <b>2</b>:13).
Paul does not say that we cannot <u>learn</u> these things when God teaches us.
Rather, we cannot <u>come to know</u> them without God’s teaching us through
revelation. We cannot find them out any other way. Consequently, 1 Corinthians <b>2</b>:14b
does not speak of our nature, but of the nature of our ignorance. We must
depend on revelation in order to come to a knowledge of God’s will. That
revelation is by the Spirit, whose message Paul identified with his preaching. By
preaching comes salvation; by philosophy comes lostness, as the Apostle
declares elsewhere in Romans <b>1</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In 1 Corinthians<b> 2</b>:14a,
Paul says that people, accustomed to reason and wisdom as the ultimate court of
appeals, do not welcome things not learned through wisdom.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>13</span> We understand him to mean that
as a general rule such is the case, <i>“ . . . not many wise men after the
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble [are called]”</i> (<b>1</b>:26). To such
people, ideas not derived through reason are not intellectually sophisticated. Paul’s
generalization need not be denied. Few intellectuals answer the gospel call
because they seek not to listen, but to discover for themselves so they can take
pride in the shrewdness of their discovery and tell other people about it (1
Corinthians <b>1</b>:26-31). Discovering carries more prestige than being told.
Finding out for oneself brings more glory than asking for instruction. Although
such people may not welcome or eagerly accept by faith the testimony of others,
they can do so and sometimes do.</span></p>

18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>“Dead through trespasses
and sins”</i> in Ephesians <b>2</b>:1 is often allegorized into meaning <i>“insensible
to spiritual matters.”</i> A corpse does not sense its physical surroundings,
but to compare lostness to death does not mean that every element associated
with a corpse can be applied to a sinner. A comparison parallels only specific
connections. For example, one does not ask of the figure <i>“Christ paid the
ransom,”</i> <i>“To whom did he pay it?”</i> That is not the reason for using
the ransom figure to refer to salvation. Christ’s work and paying a ransom are
alike in that the recipient cannot bring about his own release. There is a “payee”
in ransom transactions, but that aspect of ransom does not apply to salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

Ephesians <b>2</b>:1 means “separation from God.” To be “dead” to something
means to be separated from it or to lack awareness of it. To be “alive” to
something is to be “with it.” If Paul intends to compare death and lostness in
respect to separation and lack of awareness, he says nothing about the <u>ability</u>
to be aware. Conversely, to be dead to the world is to lack awareness of its
allurements in a participational sense, even as being dead to God means to lack
awareness of his promptings in any participational, responsive, or obedient
sense of knowing him.</span></p>

on passages that deal directly with anthropology. The Great Dilemma implies a
hermeneutical program whose direction is suggested by the observation that
Satan terminology for human activity parallels the God terminology that
Calvinism takes strictly. Among linguistic mechanisms relevant to these cases
are the tendencies (1) to streamline causal distinctions; (2) to interchange
nature, state, and action terms; and (3) to state generalities in the form of
absolutes, which sets up the danger of allegorizing the comparison. Whether
interpreters choose even to acknowledge these linguistic characteristics of
biblical expression will be determined by whether they fit with their
conception of human nature, divine nature, and the process of salvation
generally. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our contention is that (a)
the Great Dilemma shows the fallacy of the prior exegetical reasonings that
lead to that Dilemma. Correct interpretation should therefore be shaped by
whether other possible interpretations lead to that final inconsistency. Especially
is this general program appropriate because (b) the control passages about
Satan’s activities exhibit the same characteristics observed in passages about
divine activity. The sovereignty of God could conceivably be invoked to justify
some viewpoints on passages about divine activity, but sovereignty cannot be
invoked in like cases regarding Satan’s activity. Finally, (c) recognizable
linguistic phenomena observable elsewhere can be brought to bear on the
biblical evidence from the Calvinistic approach. These phenomena appear in
texts neutral to the present issue and in texts where presumably everyone would
agree they apply. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If appropriate linguistic
phenomena do in fact deal satisfactorily with individual passages used to
support the Augustinian-Calvinistic view of mankind, then at the very least no
decisive biblical evidence exists for that view. Only possible, not necessary,
interpretations exist, which would make depravity at most a matter of opinion. The
concept of natural depravity, then, does not have a biblical base, but a
philosophical one.</span></p>
