<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In place of the <u>natural
depravity</u> of traditional theology, we prefer to speak of <u>psychological
depravity</u>. In doing so, we acknowledge the power of sin without considering
ourselves subject to a determinism that results in lostness. In the construct
of depravity plus prevenient grace, psychological depravity functions on the
analogy of habit. Prevenient grace consequently omits natural regeneration from
God’s acts of grace that precede salvation. A view of human ability is
developed below under five criteria listed according to the sequence in which
they apply to the process of restoration to fellowship with God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Impossibility of original righteousness</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>The first criterion for a
biblical anthropology</b> is that <u>our view of mankind cannot provide for the
practical possibility of original sinlessness</u>. The <u>practical</u>
possibility of sinlessness, allowed by Pelagius, scandalized Augustine and
prompted him to overreact in propounding a view of mankind that eliminated even
the theoretical possibility of sinlessness.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span> Since Augustine’s time, one theological function of
natural depravity has been to guarantee the sinfulness of every person as
declared by the Psalmist, <i>“There is none righteous, no, not one”</i> (<b>14</b>:3
= <b>53</b>:3; cp. <b>5</b>:9; <b>140</b>:3; <b>10</b>:7).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> The following paragraphs propose
to show that universal sin does not require natural depravity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In our critique of Augustine’s
doctrine of evil, we enumerate originating causes of sin in each person’s life
and the continuing causes of sin in society generally. Different kinds of
ignorance, social experience, and physical components combine and interact to
create universal sin as a practical result. We are born into this life as
babies innocently impacted by varying degrees of evil influence from parents,
siblings, neighbors, playmates, schoolmates, and others. Consequently, we are
faced with negative moral input before we even have a standard by which to
evaluate that input. These immoral influences address the physical and
psychological desires at a time when the child has not developmentally reached
a stage where he can operate interpersonally with much facility and
consistency. Not having arrived at the socialization stage means that he has a
hard time projecting his consciousness over behind the eyes of someone else and
thus being able to fulfill the Golden Rule. He operates in a moral situation at
the very time he is not fully trained for relational existence or fully capable
of moving relationally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Pervasive effect of sin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>A second criterion of a
biblical anthropology</b> is that <u>our view of mankind must provide for the
pervasive effect of sin on every aspect of the self and its relations</u>.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:16.0pt'>3</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>First, sin
<b>(1) </b><u>produces personal guilt</u> in all those to whom God “imputes”
guilt, that is, holds sin against them. The imputation of that sin against a
person’s “record” includes all of us either because of disobedience to
revelation or disobedience to the correct leading of conscience.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>            </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Beyond personal guilt are those effects of personal
sin that accrue to each of us ourselves, not just to our status. Sin <b>(2) </b><u>perverts
bodily appetites</u>. There is pleasure in sin, but it lasts only for a while
(Hebrews <b>11</b>:15) because sating the senses soon deadens them and because
pleasure ends at death. Exploiting physical appetites subjects them to the law
of diminishing returns. When over-exercised and pursued for their own sake,
they do not yield the fulfillment sought in pursuing them. The physiological
and psychological make-up are alike in this respect as the Preacher says
incisively, <i>“He that loves silver is not satisfied with silver”</i>
(Ecclesiastes<b> 5</b>:10-12; cp. Galatians <b>6</b>:8). Only when desires are
fulfilled within the boundaries of restraint do we experience the satisfaction
intended in them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sin also <b>(3) </b><u>weakens
will power</u>. The strength of a habit is known to everyone who has tried to
break one. At an early age, people learn patterns of thought, behavior, and
emotional reaction at the conscious level. By repetition these consciously
learned patterns incorporate themselves into the personality at the
subconscious level and take on the strength of a habit that the mind does not
notice and the will finds hard to override.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sin <b>(4)</b> <u>confuses
the mind</u>. When God and his purposes do not shape our thinking, something
else becomes the center of our worldview, either ourselves or some other
substitute for the one true God. With a false internal or external center, we rotate
or revolve in a false pattern of living. Without God in our thinking, knowledge
is incomplete. Because this incompleteness has to do with ultimate concerns, it
necessarily errs. Sin lives the lie that the true God is absent, does not care,
or does not exist. As a result, the actions of the body produce a “living logic”
that accepts this error as true. People become “corrupt in mind” (1 Timothy <b>6</b>:5;
2 Timothy <b>3</b>:8).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sin <b>(5) </b><u>disorients
the emotions</u>. The lack of “natural affection” overtakes us when we give up
God and are given up by him (Romans <b>1</b>:24-32). Our heart will be where our
treasure is (Matthew <b>6</b>:21) because feelings attach themselves to the
objects of attention. The deceitfulness of sin produces despair by forming
compulsions that cannot be fulfilled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Recurring sin <b>(6) </b><u>defiles
the conscience</u> because the moral sense originally learned is subsequently
conditioned by action. When the promptings of conscience go unheeded, they
weaken with time. Conscience is not lost with the practice of a sin, but it
ceases to condemn that sin. It is seared with a hot iron and defiled (1 Timothy
<b>4</b>:2; Titus <b>1</b>:15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In all our parts we are dynamic
units. Being interdependent, the members influence each other reciprocally. The
body tempts the mind (James <b>3</b>:2-3), and the mind commands the body (1
Corinthians <b>9</b>:27). It is not possible to sin in only one part of the
self or to confine the consequences of sin to any one arena of conflict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In all our relations we are
also a dynamic unity, but the presence of sin <b>(7) </b><u>fragments society</u>
by alienating bond and free, male and female, Jew and Gentile, rich and poor,
learned and unlearned. Sin always tends toward death, or separation, vertically
from God (1), horizontally from other people (7), and internally from our own
selves (2-6). The effects of sin may be inferred backwards from the mission of
Christ and his church to save us (1 Timothy <b>1</b>:15), to unite us
(Ephesians <b>2</b>:15), and to heal us (Ephesians <b>5</b>:21-24). As acting
contrary to the nature of marriage dissolves marriage, acting contrary to the
nature of society destroys society. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sating the flesh turns us in
on ourselves and destroys our harmonious relations with other people. Sin
begets a selfishness that seeks independence from other people or manipulates
other people to selfish ends. When there is no common center for society,
society is impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A final consequence of sin
is that it <b>(8) </b><u>forfeits dominion over nature</u>. As ecological
concerns show, people cannot even fulfill the first commission to the human
race because sin has entered into the picture. Accordingly, the Hebrew writer
declares that one reason for the incarnation was to qualify Jesus as
representative mankind to stand over the works of God’s hands (<b>2</b>:5-9).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the first criterion of
anthropology, the givens of human existence account for <u>universal sin</u>. In
the second criterion, interdependence and reciprocity account for <u>pervasive
sin</u>. Within each of us, false action in one aspect feeds off into other
aspects. Between us, false actions in one of us beget false actions in others. Since
within persons and between persons the “parts” interact reciprocally, sin does
not remain isolated in any one aspect of us or our relations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Natural ability for response to God</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>The third criterion of a
biblical anthropology</b> is that <u>our view of mankind must provide for our
ability to respond to God</u>. For us to be able to respond to God, the process
of coming to faith interrelates the factors shown in the accompanying sketch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Subjective point of
contact</u>. The point of contact in us as fallen lies in our (a) sense of
dependence, (b) drive for meaningfulness, (c) need for innocence, and (d)
desire to be loved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On the negative side,
providentially God has built natural evil into our existence—disease, natural
catastrophe, suffering, and death. Genesis <b>3</b>:16-24 shows that because of
our sin God placed limitations in our experience. Removal from the tree of life
followed the exercise of independent autonomy by dependent beings. Living
forever while experientially knowing good and evil would mean that no practical
difference would exist between good and evil. By limiting freedom to less than
what seems ideal for us, the creator placed perceptually in our experience—not
just conceptually in our understanding—our secondary place in reality. General
revelation creates at least a subconscious awareness of finitude and
dependence. It is intuitively obvious that dependent beings need more than they
can supply and that they lack ultimate sovereignty over their destiny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On the positive side, we
seek a reason to live so that a sense of insignificance fosters suicide. As
individuals we are driven to purpose and to become, and as social creatures we
aspire to community and love. The need for security and innocence and the
desire for love and worth in community form two sets of givens in human nature
that derive from creation and providence. We naturally can recognize
dependence, guilt, alienation, and worthlessness, and can reason that only a
sovereign can determine his own significance and be central in society. The
ability to be loved provides the point of contact for redemption from guilt,
worthlessness, and insecurity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Objective revelation</u>.
A sense of dependence and meaninglessness on the subjective side does not
necessarily prove the existence of something to depend on or give meaning on
the objective side. It does, however, prime us for accepting that possibility. The
sense of finitude requires that external evidence for the Infinite not be
treated academically or indifferently. The sense of guilt and alienation makes
the offer of reconciliation relevant. The sense of meaninglessness legitimizes
listening to proclamation about a basis for worth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The point here differs from
the aim of what is called natural theology. Natural theology attempts to use
reason and experience to ascertain the existence of an omnipotent,
transcendent, personal, holy God. On the basis of that knowledge from general
revelation in nature, we can subsequently learn from special revelation in the
Bible the particulars about God, mankind, sin, and salvation. Philosophy leads
to theology at the content level in such an arrangement. In our proposal,
however, philosophy leads to theology only at the formal level. In the face of
general revelation, human experience justifies us in listening to what special
revelation says. Reason and experience do not generate the content of truth,
but they do create an awareness of the need for it. Special revelation then
presents the answer to that problem of need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For the positive object of
ultimate concern, we must involve the scripture principle. Proclamation
confronts us with the explicit answer to our implicit problem. In the preceding
diagram Step #1 prepares the needy for recognizing in the Christian faith the
object of their need. Step #2 is revelatory, coming to us from the outside. Revelation
does not replace intuition or <i>vice versa</i>. Revelation is recognized
intuitively. Intuition is contentless in itself. From a practical, functional
standpoint, the first aspect of Step #2 is <b>(a)</b> the <u>body of Christ</u>
that demonstrates an attitude and radiates a love. The crucial role of the
church in the atonement appears in Paul’s statement to the Colossians, <i>“I
rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the
afflictions of Christ for the sake of his body the church”</i> (<b>1</b>:24). The
second aspect is <b>(b) </b><u>the message of Christ</u> itself, proclaimed by
the church in word and deed, and given life, perceivableness, and power in the
world. Inherent within the message is a power independent of the witness of the
church. That power proceeds from its correlation with our needs so that, on the
principle of correlation, we can recognize in it the quality of answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Beyond correlation with
perceived needs is <b>(c) </b><u>the Christ event</u>, including the historical
evidence independent of the question-answer composite. The Christian kerygma
uniquely proceeds from historical events without which the faith would not
exist. Its eventness makes Christianity subject to historical inquiry, and so
Christian evidences combine with the inherent power of the gospel and the
living demonstration of the church to comprise one dynamic whole to which people
can respond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We need to point out here
that this order in Step #2—church, gospel, history—is the <u>practical order</u>
in proclamation. It represents the chronological sequence in which the
unredeemed come into contact with the objective basis for the faith. The <u>theological
order</u> of what is proclaimed begins at the opposite end with <u>the events</u>
in which the message inheres, <u>the message</u> that describes the intended
meaning of those events, and <u>the church</u> that proclaims that message. The
body of Christ does not originate the message, but conveys it, and the hearer
turns to face the One to whom it points.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>I-You encounter</u>. The
objective message directed toward people in subjective need leads to Step #3,
where the hearer begins to live in terms of what was proclaimed, demonstrated,
and sensed. Step #3 becomes the place of subjective confirmation through
personal experience, producing added practical evidence. Here is the place of
encounter in I-You relationship. For the negative side, the need for security
is answered in the omnipotent Father of Jesus Christ who can even resurrect the
dead. For the positive side, the need for significance is found first in the
love of the Father and then in the love of Christians. Paul extolled love in 1
Corinthians for giving a sense of meaning to words (<b>13</b>:1), abilities (<b>13</b>:2),
and acts (<b>13</b>:3). Love gives a sense of existential meaning (punctiliar).
From love arises the trust that creates hope for the future. The suicide of
purposelessness is replaced by a sense of eschatological meaning (linear). Existential
love and eschatological hope produce an ongoing sense of worth in the security
of community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christian living (Step #3)
refines perceived needs (Step #2) in terms of the gospel and the new experience
the gospel brings. This factor is important because correlation by itself
assumes that the right questions are being asked, and the needs are correctly
perceived. The gospel message and the Christian experience sharpen the
awareness of actual needs. Step #3 also reciprocates backward on the message
itself; experiencing the message clarifies the meaning of the message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We can respond to God
because negatively we can perceive our dependence and guilt, and because
positively we can yearn for love and purpose. We can respond to God because we
can recognize the correlation between problem and solution. We can see in the
faith the potential answer for our yearnings because therein <i>“the secrets of
his heart are manifest” </i>(1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:25). We can respond to God
because we can love in response to love, and we can hope because of the faith
love generates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Impossibility of self-justification</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>The fourth criterion of a
biblical anthropology</b> is that <u>our view of mankind cannot provide for the
possibility of self-justification</u>. Paul reasons that if we could save ourselves
Christ died for nothing (Galatians <b>2</b>:21;<b> 3</b>:21). The doctrine of
natural depravity has safeguarded against self-salvation. J. Oliver Buswell,
Jr., in a representative statement, spoke in this vein regarding Calvinistic
theology, <i>“The doctrine of unconditional election follows necessarily from
the doctrine of total inability.”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> Since
in Calvin’s view we are depraved, we have no ability to meet any conditions in
terms of which our election could be figured. Theoretically, other reasons
might conceivably eliminate self-salvation; but if inability is the case,
self-salvation is all the more impossible. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Using natural depravity to
explain the impossibility of self-salvation illustrates overkill. Other
sufficient reasons exist besides this <u>natural</u> reason. The most basic
reason lies in (a) the <u>interpersonal</u> character of salvation. A
relationship must be established from both sides. When one person breaks the
relationship by sinning, the other must do the forgiving before it can be
re-established. Furthermore, forgiveness by the other is not subject to
coercion. From a (b) <u>functional</u> standpoint, people cannot save themselves
because they need the influence of other people to help them rise above the practice
of sin that dissolves relationships. In a (c) <u>corporate</u> sense, we cannot
save himself because he cannot rise above the status of the group of which he
has chosen to become a part.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> When
a person sins, in effect he identifies with the “Adam” group by acting
essentially as Adam acted; consequently, he shares the effects of being part of
that group, particularly separation from God and more generally those
consequences that flow from that separation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We cannot save ourselves
because of the nature of imperfection. All interpersonal relationships use a
perfection standard. That is particularly so in fellowship with a perfect God. Once
perfection is lost it cannot be regained. The nature of imperfection means
imperfection cannot be overcome. Earlier we argued that, though someone could
theoretically remain sinless, practically speaking he will never do so. Here we
observe that even theoretically sinners cannot become sinless after they sin. The
two points taken together mean that all have sinned practically speaking, and none
can save themselves even theoretically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            People fall, not from
ability, but from perfection. It is not our nature, but the nature of our
circumstance that precludes self-salvation. The nature of imperfection means
that imperfection cannot be overcome. We cannot save ourselves, not because we
cannot respond to God, but because our response to God cannot save us. We
cannot “make up for” <u>our own</u> past sin by working harder from now on, by
going back and doing the act over, or by hoping guilt will dissipate with time.
There are no “leftovers” from <u>other saint’s perfect lives</u> that can be
transferred to imperfect people. The attitude and fact of the matter is that
when we have done everything commanded, we should say, <i>“We are unprofitable
servants; we have done what it was our duty to do” </i>(Luke <b>17</b>:10). Under
that circumstance no treasury of unnecessary good works can build up for other
people’s salvation. Besides, more is involved in personal relationships than
either person’s doing good things: there is always the added component from the
other person in the relationship, who sovereignly decides to accept us and love
us because of <u>his</u> goodness in wanting to do so. Relationships are not
caused from just one side, and they are not earned simply by the goodness of
either side. Love is what holds relationships together, and love on one side is
not caused by the goodness of the other, and love does not depend on that
goodness or at least a perfect degree of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Perfection is the ideal held
up in all relationships human or divine. Relationships exist, however, only
because repentance and forgiveness make up the difference between performance
and perfection. Moral perfection has always been God’s ideal. One sin cast our
first parents out of the Garden. The Mosaic Law required continually doing
everything commanded (Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:26; cp. Galatians <b>3</b>:10). Jesus
teaches in the Sermon on the Mount, <i>“So be perfect like your heavenly Father”</i>
(Matthew <b>5</b>:48; cp. James <b>2</b>:10). Once lost, perfection cannot be
regained; consequently, sinners cannot save themselves for interpersonal,
corporate, functional, and legal reasons. Natural depravity is not necessary
for protecting against autosoterism.</span></p>

to the mind without being welcomed there. Sin is an act and a state. It is not

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Wesley felt that scripture
implied entire sanctification in passages that (1) describe Christians as being
<u>restored to the image of God</u> (Romans <b>8</b>:29; 1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:49;
2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:18; Colossians <b>1</b>:15-22; <b>3</b>:10; Ephesians <b>4</b>:23;
cp. 2 Peter <b>1</b>:2-4). (2) Other passages <u>exhort the saints to have the
mind of Christ</u> (Luke <b>6</b>:40; Romans <b>12</b>:1-2; 1 Corinthians <b>2</b>:16;
2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:9; Philippians <b>2</b>:5-11; 2 Timothy<b> 2</b>:21;
Hebrews <b>12</b>:2; 1 Peter. <b>2</b>:21). Furthermore, (3) believers are to
be <u>filled with the Spirit</u> (Ephesians <b>5</b>:18). (4) The word <u>perfect</u>
occurs in commandments and promises: <i>“Be perfect as your heavenly Father is
perfect”</i> (Matthew <b>5</b>:48).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span> (5)
<u>1 John <b>3</b>:6-9 and <b>5</b>:18</u> say that a Christian does not and
cannot sin. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Further observations in
scripture, however, adjust this understanding of holy living. (a) Speaking to “sinless”
Christians in <b>1</b>:8-10, 1 John exhibits a pattern found elsewhere in
calling it a lie for Christians to claim sinlessness. (b) Evidently “to have
sin” (<b>1</b>:8) and <i>“to sin”</i> (1 John <b>3</b>:6, 8, 9; <b>5</b>:18)
respectively mean occasional sin <i>vs</i>. characteristic sin, because in the
latter connection John says that Satan <i>“sins from the beginning,”</i> hence,
characteristically (<b>3</b>:8).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> More
directly (c) in <b>5</b>:16-17 a distinction occurs between <i>“sin unto death”</i>
and <i>“sin not unto death,”</i> the latter being something a “brother” might
do. The <i>“sin not unto death”</i> clearly coincides with <i>“not sinning”</i>
because <b>5</b>:18 immediately reaffirms as in <b>3</b>:6, 9 that the one
begotten by God<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11 </span>does not
sin and because the only two Johannine definitions of sin occur in these two
contexts. The writer must have the same set of contrasts in mind in both
places. There is a Christian sinfulness not unto death that contrasts with
characteristic sinfulness unto death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As 2 Peter <b>1</b>:10
promises, with the continuing development of godly qualities a Christian will
never stumble. Jude 24 teaches that God can keep a person from stumbling. However,
James <b>3</b>:2 admits, <i>“In many things we all stumble.”</i> Not to stumble
and to stumble must mean, respectively, <u>falling away <i>vs</i>. falling
short</u> as in stumbling to fall (Romans <b>11</b>:11) contrasted with
stumbling only. There is a Christian sinfulness that contrasts with apostasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The paradox appears in
Pauline literature as well when the apostle expressly denies having attained
perfection (Philippians<b> 3</b>:12-14) only to affirm it afterwards: <i>“Let
us as many as are perfect, be thus minded”</i> (<b>3</b>:15). Not perfect yet
perfect indicates <u>behavior <i>vs.</i> state</u> (<i>i.e</i>., as <u>regarded</u>
by the other) or actual <i>vs</i>. “for all practical purposes.” There is a
Christian sinfulness that contrasts with justification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the Philippians statement,
Paul considers perfection (1) a <u>goal</u> rather than a achievement, <i>“I
press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
Jesus”</i> (<b>3</b>:14; cp. Hebrews <b>12</b>:2). The Hebrew writer ascribes
perfection to Christians as (2) a <u>state</u>, <i>“For by one offering he has
perfected forever those who are sanctified”</i> (<b>10</b>:14). He included
with it a perfection in (3) <u>conscience</u>, <i>“ . . . gifts and sacrifices
that cannot as regards the conscience make the worshiper perfect”</i> (<b>9</b>:9;
cp. <b>10</b>:1-3, 10). Being offered repeatedly, such gifts and sacrifices are
replaced by <i>“the body of Jesus Christ”</i> offered once and for all. The
saved experience the loss of any guilt complex. The <u>status</u> of being
viewed as perfect makes appropriate behavior tending toward perfection and
produces a <u>consciousness</u> of being considered perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Although sin is still sin
regardless of knowledge, it is doubtful whether “occasional sin,” “stumbling,”
and “not perfect” in the above examples can be accounted for simply by
ignorance as allowed in the doctrine of entire sanctification. (1) Paul presses
on toward this perfection as a goal. (2) 1 John<b> 5</b>:16-18 contrasts the
sense in which a Christian sins and the “sin unto death” for which a brother
does not ask forgiveness in another, which seems to imply its unforgivableness.
Wesleyanism, however, has not taught the unforgivableness of someone who lacks
entire sanctification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Entire sanctification has
three <u>exegetical weaknesses</u>. (1) It reads statements about the state of
justification as statements about the behavior of sanctification. “Sanctification”
as a punctiliar action in scripture does not mean that sanctification,
theologically defined, is instantaneous, but that the categorical change of
state is set forth under the idea of “making holy” as well as under the idea of
“making just.” (2) It reads statements about characteristic holiness as
statements about absolute holiness. (3) It reads statements about attempted
holiness as statements about achieved holiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Entire sanctification has
three <u>systematic weaknesses</u>. First there is (1) the question of how
sanctification could be by grace without involving natural depravity. A
stimulus-response or miraculous model could not escape determinism if it were
an operating grace rather than a cooperating grace. A second weakness in
Wesleyanism and in Pelagianism is (2) the supposition that the theoretical
possibility of perfection will lead to its actuality, though the two differ as
to whether this perfection is an original sinlessness or a subsequent sinlessness
only and as to whether this perfection is by ability or by grace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, entire
sanctification leads to an <u>experiential weakness</u>. It militates against
assurance of salvation. Calvinistic sanctification undercuts assurance by
making the present status inseparable from the final end inasmuch as
perseverance marks genuine conversion. Wesleyan sanctification undercuts
assurance by creating an experiential expectancy. Saved, but unsanctified,
citizens may not by experience be able to distinguish themselves from alien
good moral people or from apostates. The possibility of apostasy is not
objectionable as such, but there is a loss of assurance that can go with it
because of this formulation of sanctification. The self-authenticating of
Christian experience is subordinate to the kerygma. Salvation is known
primarily by promise (objective) and secondarily by experience (subjective). The
sense of assurance arises from this knowledge as we experience Christian
growth. The sense of assurance may not continuously be commensurate with the
objective basis for it; but when the expectancy is that it should come to be
commensurate, a temporary lull tends either toward fear and despair, or toward
insensitivity. A sense of assurance should not become a reason for assurance
lest a lack of that sense become a reason against it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Reasons against
subsequent sinlessness</u>. Even if a Christian <u>can</u> become perfect,
actually no one <u>will</u>. (1) All factors that led to sin in the first place
continue to operate later. What caused unfallen people to <u>fall</u> from
perfection will continue to make them <u>fall short</u> of it; and if they are
not careful to persevere, they may <u>fall away</u> altogether.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (2) Ingrained habit is
harder to break than to make, especially in subtle psychological patterns like
a sense of despondency, avoidance, frustration, failure, and guilt complex. Niebuhr’s
idea that people would not feel tempted had they never sinned overstated the
point,<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> but it drew
attention to the drag of past failure on present resolve. One interpretation of
Hebrews <b>4</b>:15 suggests that Jesus was tempted like other people in all
points “apart from [</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>χωρίς</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>choris</i>] sin,” <i>i.e., </i>except by past
sin. All others have sinned less or more and are then hindered less or more in
the triumphant Christian life. It is easier to explain continued sin than “original”
sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) If sin affects all
aspects of a person and if all aspects affect reciprocally, then each of us is
a complex of interwoven sin habits. The likelihood is nil for dealing with
these on all fronts in the face of constant originating and perpetuating
factors.</span></p>

A. Turner lists four other unique features in Wesley’s view of sanctification: (2)
it is distinct from, and consequent to, regeneration; (3) it comes entirely by
faith rather than by co-operating grace; (4) though normally gradual,
sanctification is often consummated in a moment; and (5) a person may have the “witness

1 John <b>4</b>:12, 17-18. In the range of meanings for this root, however, we
do not have just perfection, but maturity, completeness, completion,
fulfillment. The word picture in <i>tel-</i> is that of “end”; consequently, it
tends to have a directional thrust in circumstances that describe process. This
feature of the term makes it especially appropriate for referring to spiritual
development.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In some ways interpersonalism makes
perfection even harder. Jesus’ statement in Matthew is more than an ideal
perfection. It is a particular kind of perfection, a perfection of love more
than law. A person might do everything in a list of do’s and don’t’s without
being interpersonally perfect. Exceeding the righteousness of the scribes and
Pharisees does not mean being more fastidious at it than they were; it means
having a higher type of righteousness—one of love, as in the First and Second Great
Commandments. This righteousness is higher because it assumes responsibility
for helping <u>other people</u> become more than they are, which is more than
personal justness. It is concerned with <u>the heart</u> as well as external
behaviors directly, which means it is more than humanly observable behavior. It
is a matter of doing good <u>in return for evil</u>, which is more than
justice. It addresses internal motives and attitudes, which means it goes
beyond quantifiable considerations. It means doing from within rather than under
compulsion from outside (Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34). Not going beyond the call
of duty is in practice what law tends to elicit, but being sons of the Father
means being like him as in being a peacemaker and sending rain on evil as well
as good</span></p>
