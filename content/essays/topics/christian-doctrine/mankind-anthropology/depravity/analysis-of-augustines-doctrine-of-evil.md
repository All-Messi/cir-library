<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The view of mankind common
in evangelicalism descends from Augustine of Hippo. His early efforts in
philosophy centered on the problem of evil. Although he spent his earliest
years under the influence of Catholic Christianity, he left that background to
become an Auditor for nine years in a Gnostic-like sect that followed the
teachings of Mani. At first, Manichaeism seemed to him to explain the problem
by teaching that evil and good are two kinds of substances. They have become
intermingled in mankind so that “salvation” consists of separating good from
its mixture with evil. Because of internal inconsistencies that Augustine came
to see in this dualistic philosophy, he eventually left it and returned to
Christianity. The problem of evil stood at the beginning of his development as
a philosopher-theologian; its solution stood near the center of the theological
system he formulated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine’s understanding of
evil and sin originated in response to two important factors in his
circumstance. The first was Manichaeism in his earlier writings; the second was
Pelagianism in his later ones. In the case of Manichaeism, he argued against a
natural dualism where good and evil were two ultimate substances, or natures. In
the case of Pelagianism, he argued against a view of the consequences of sin
that appeared to make divine grace unnecessary in salvation. His positive
proposal was suggested by Neo-Platonism and was put in connection with the
Genesis statement, <i>“God saw that everything he had made was very good”</i> (<b>1</b>:31).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In contrast to Manichaeism,
Augustine was undertaking to demonstrate by reason what he first understood by
faith. Scripture had provided him with the insight that the material universe,
the world, and mankind are good. He used reason to discover the assumptions
necessary for making that scriptural concept true. To determine the <u>origin</u>
of evil, he sought to analyze its <u>nature</u>, <u>criterion</u>, and <u>cause</u>.
What evil is, how it is measured, and what causes it led to an explanation of
where it came from. What something is must be understood before its source can
be sought.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Nature of evil</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Manichaeism taught that <u>some
substance is good</u>, some is evil, and that both kinds of substances are
equally eternal. In contrast, Augustine said that <u>all substance is good</u>.
Some is incorruptible, but <u>some substance is corruptible</u>. God is
incorruptible good but what is not God is corruptible good. The incorruptible
created the corruptible, so not all substance is equally eternal. <u>Corruptible
substance is not eternal</u>. Evil pertains to the corruptible substance, so <u>evil
had a beginning in corruptible good</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine could say that <u>all
nature is good</u> because scripture as well as the Manichees said that <u>God</u>
is good. He could say that all <u>non-God</u> is good because before the Fall
God called his creation good (Genesis <b>1</b>:31) and because scripture
elsewhere says, <i>“Every creation by God is good”</i> (1 Timothy <b>4</b>:4). The
incorruptible, good, eternal God created all that is non-God, so all things are
good because only good can come from what is incorruptibly good.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine could distinguish <u>two
kinds of good</u> because scripture differentiates between <u>corruptible</u>
and <u>incorruptible</u>, <i>“. . . you will change them, and they will be
changed, but you are the same” </i>(Psalm <b>102</b>:26-27). Elsewhere the
Bible states, <i>“Now to the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, the only
God be honor and glory forever and ever”</i> (1 Timothy <b>1</b>:17). <i>“Every
good and perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights,
with whom there is no variableness or shadow of turning”</i> (James <b>1</b>:17).
<i>“You will not let your Holy One see corruption”</i> (Psalm <b>16</b>:6, cp.
Acts <b>2</b>:27; <b>13</b>:35).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> God
is good, and his creation is always called good; consequently, incorruptible
good created corruptible good.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            These considerations <u>locate
evil</u> outside of God and in the created realm, but they do not yet <u>define
evil</u> precisely. Augustine did not simply adjust Manichaeism from two kinds
of natures to one good nature. He meant that good is in nature (substance) as a
characteristic. Good is not a substance, but a quality of substance. Good is <u>in</u>
corruptible nature; hence, it is <u>a characteristic</u> that a nature can come
to have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Manichaeism had pictured
evil as a <u>kind of substance</u> rather than a <u>quality of substance</u>. Augustine
detected inconsistency here because Hyle, the dark lord of evil substance,
possessed good health, nourishment, fecundity, and other consequences of good
nature. In so picturing him, Manichaeism demonstrated the impossibility of
conceptualizing an absolutely evil substance. If the present situation involves
a mixture of good and evil substances, then ultimately salvation leads to
unmixing them. Unmixed good and evil means that eventually there will be pure,
absolute evil. But something absolutely evil cannot experience consequences of
good substance.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> Substance as
such is good, so evil must be an unnecessary quality within good substance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Substance has both <u>form
and content</u>. For substance to exist, it must have form. Since form is a
necessary characteristic of substance, form itself must be good.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> Anything that has form must
therefore be good at least insofar as it has form. What contains good is not
opposite to good, but evil is opposite to good. Opposite attributes cannot be
applied to the same thing.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> The
Manichaean doctrine of evil substance is rejected because all substance
contains form, and form is good because form is what brings good consequences. There
is not good form and bad form, but form itself is good. The form of substance
is precisely what good is, because substance must have form to have existence. All
substance is good<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> so evil is
not a substance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Determining that evil <u>is
not</u> a substance does not specify what it <u>is</u>. Since substance is good
and is necessarily comprised of form and content, evil is not a form or a
content of substance. Evil corresponds with non-existence because shape, or
form, as well as “stuff” makes up every existing thing. <i>“Evil is that which
is contrary to the nature of kind.”</i><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>9</span> Precisely, then, evil must be a “lack” in the form of
substance. The word “privation” has traditionally referred to the essence of
evil according to Augustine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The “lack” is not a lack <u>of</u>
nature, but a lack <u>in</u> nature. More specifically, evil is a lack <u>in
the order of</u> nature. The privation is a qualitative lack seen in
deterioration, corruption, disorder, defect. Form inheres in content so that if
form were removed, content would disappear, <i>“A corporeal object has some
concord between its parts; otherwise, it could not exist at all.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> Substance <i>vs.</i>
non-substance is an either-or matter, but order <i>vs.</i> disorder is a matter
of degree. To the extent that something has order it is good; but to the extent
that it lacks order, form, organization it is evil. All substance is good to
some degree because it has form. All <u>incorruptible nature</u> is absolutely
good because it has all its form. All <u>corruptible nature</u> is absolutely
good as long as it has all its form. All <u>corrupted nature</u> is good to the
extent that it has its form, and evil to the extent that it lacks it. Evil is
relative, not categorical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            An example may help
crystallize an understanding of Augustine’s proposal that evil is a lack in the
form of substance. Some commentators have suggested that previous to the
Genesis flood a vapor canopy surrounded the earth. Before the flood there is no
mention of rain, and Genesis<b> 2</b>:6 says that a mist came up from the earth
to water the ground. Water for the flood was partially supplied by the collapse
of that canopy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Precipitating such a canopy
would create a lack in the order of nature with many natural evils resulting. Water
vapor filters out harmful cosmic rays that form mutations. One theory of aging
proposes that as the proportionate number of mutational cells increases in the
body, their accumulated effect contributes to the dysfunction and ultimate
death of an organism. A vapor canopy would have a greenhouse effect that would
provide a uniform climate worldwide. An environment without precipitation would
greatly relieve shelter and clothing needs, and would eliminate climatic
catastrophes like storms, tornadoes, and floods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The post-diluvian world
would have the same amount of matter, but the disorganization in matter
represents a lack of order as measured relative to the pre-collapsed condition.
Collapsing the vapor canopy causes untold pain and suffering for life forms
better suited to the previous circumstance. On this kind of model, Augustine
conceived of all evil, suffering, and sin.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>11</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine stressed <u>nature</u>,
or substance, in defining evil, but he included <u>action</u> as well. <i>“</i>[Pelagius]<i>
quotes also John of Constantinople, as saying ‘that sin is not a substance, but
a wicked act.’ Who denies this?”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> <i>“</i>[Gold,
food, female beauty] <i>are not to be blamed, but the men who make a bad use of
them.”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>13</span> Nevertheless, he
maintained that the problem involved more than action; it involved a problem in
substance that produces actions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Besides nature and action
Augustine posited a third class. A soul is a thing; theft is an act; avarice is
a defect. A person is avaricious even when he is not stealing.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>14</span> To <u>nature</u> and <u>action</u>
he added <u>property</u>,<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>15</span> by
which <i>“he apparently means a non-essential attribute, without which man
would remain man, but yet not what is called a ‘separable accident.’”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>16</span> Since the Fall man has had
desires like avarice and concupiscence. These properties need not exist in
human nature; yet no person can free himself from the fallen nature that
uniformly includes them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In summary, evil represents
a privation, or lack, in the form of being, nature, substance. Sinful action
comes from evil nature, which introduces the issue of the cause of evil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Cause of evil</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            By epitomizing evil under
the word “lack,” Augustine included the cause of evil in its very definition. Defective
nature produces defective action, an idea seemingly compatible with Matthew <b>7</b>:18
and other texts which teach that good fruit comes from good trees, <i>etc</i>. Nature
demonstrates its character in performance.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>17</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In speaking about evil and
sin as caused by a lack, Augustine did not mean the lack itself but the lacking
condition. The <u>difference</u> between the undeteriorated and deteriorated
conditions accounts for the difference between good and evil in nature
generally and between righteousness and sin in persons particularly. A lose
tube in an amplifier causes popping and cracking when the guitar music vibrates
through it. That is bad relative to the effects produced by an amplifier that “works.”
In the personal realm, Augustine’s formulation fits well with the ancient idea
that sickness in general is caused by imbalance of the humors. Sickness and sin
were closely related in his mind. Hormone imbalance does greatly affect human
behaviors that issue from the basic drives that hormones can affect. The “disorder”
does not make a person completely dysfunctional, but it produces behavior that
is not good.  Persons do not cease being persons, and they are still
responsible for their actions, but they do not “work right.” In moral matters
the condition would make them not “righteous.” The remaining “stuff” with its
lesser order produces the lesser of different action and behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine’s concept of evil
assumed a necessary correspondence between nature and action, a being-action
composite. The deformed being produces deformed act. Conversely, the deformed
act can produce deformed being, <i>“Vice in the soul arises from its own doing,
and the moral difficulty that ensues from vice is the penalty which it suffers
. . . . Careless looking at the sun and the disturbance that is its consequence
is evil.”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>18</span> The
one-for-one correlation between being and behavior is a kind of determinism
with a long history that continues today in Skinnerian behaviorism and related
views. In this respect Augustine is quite contemporary in his approach to the
cause of evil action and sinful, or “abnormal,” behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <u>nature of evil</u> as
defective nature and the <u>cause of evil</u> as defective nature means the <u>measure
of evil</u> is “un-defective” nature. The nature, cause, and criterion of evil
lie in substance. The undeteriorated form of a thing serves as its standard of
rectitude. Augustine’s use of original nature for evaluative purposes goes with
his practice of contemplating human nature as unfallen human nature rather than
presently observed human nature.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>19 </span>The
flesh-spirit discord described in Galatians <b>5</b>:17 and elsewhere he called
a defect, not a nature.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>20</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Pristine nature provides the
standard for good because it demonstrates the eternal truth God directly
expressed in nature at creation<i>, “It is not evil because it is forbidden by
law; it is forbidden by law because it is evil.”</i><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>21</span> <i>“Sin, then, is any transgression in deed or word, or
desire of the eternal law.” </i>By “eternal law” he meant natural law, not
revelational law, <i>“And the eternal law is the divine order or will of God,
which requires the preservation of natural order, and forbids the breach of it.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>22</span> Since the natural order reflects
the will of God, sin means living contrary to nature. Augustine’s philosophy of
nature afforded him the concept of innate, more than revealed, ethic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

arises from pristine nature. Original nature provides the standard for
deteriorated nature, and defective and perfect action derive from their
respective natures. Original nature becomes the frame of reference for

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The nature, cause, and
criterion of evil pose the question of how present evil could originate from
good nature. In contrast to the Manichaean notion that evil is co-eternal with
good, Augustine’s model attempts to provide an origin for evil by associating
evil with a created nature. Inasmuch as evil is a “non-thing,” strictly
speaking Augustine had to say that he did not know where evil came from, <i>“That
which is nothing cannot be known.”</i><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>23</span> Nevertheless, he had some positive things to say. Since
sin and evil had a beginning, he sought to devise an answer that did not fall
into an infinite regress.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>24</span> Evil
cannot be traced even back to God because everything God created is called
good.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>25</span> Augustine located the
source of sin in the free will of God’s creatures although free will itself is
good.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>26</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On the basis of Genesis <b>3</b>,
Augustine said that evil originated through the Fall of Adam as far as mankind
and his environment are concerned. The question here is whether the defective
condition of mankind after the Fall was an (a) inherent result or a (b)
non-inherent result of Adam’s sin (<u>either-or</u>). Since it is difficult to
conceive of how some aspects of the situation after the Fall could have been
inherent results of Adam’s exercise of free will, (c) a combination of internal
and external factors could be posited. Some consequences may have resulted
inherently while others resulted non-inherently (<u>in parallel</u>). Perhaps a
combination of internal and external causation both played a part in a single
consequence (<u>conjoined</u>). In reference to human nature itself, Augustine
may have pictured God as external cause of mankind’s evil by creating man in a
way that when he sinned depravity automatically resulted from within. These two
modes of causation would be <u>in series</u>.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>27</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This last model seems most
in keeping with the sum of Augustine’s expression on the origin of evil and sin
in man. On the one hand, he speaks of mankind as existing in a penal state.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>28</span> “Penalty” sounds like external
cause. On the other hand, he sounds as if he believed human depravity resulted
from the disobedience itself, <i>“It was by the evil use of his free-will that
man destroyed both it and himself.”</i><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>29</span> The statements combine consistently if God created human
nature in such a way that when mankind sinned, he corrupted himself. Augustine
could conceive of “penalty” through inherent, internal cause, <i>“Vice in the
soul arises from its own doing; and the moral difficulty that ensues from vice
is the penalty it suffers.”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>30</span> Mankind’s
fallen nature came from divine disablement through internal causation when Adam
first used his free will contrary to his nature. In other words, sin tends to
self-destruct.</span></p>

evil together with its originating and continuing causes apply to mankind as
represented by the diagram below. Adam’s <u>sinful act</u> produced a <u>penal
state</u> involving desire for temporal things, desire for things able to be
taken away without loss contrary to man’s <u>defective nature</u>, which in
turn produced <u>concupiscence</u>. For Augustine concupiscence epitomized the
effect of depraved nature. In his thinking, concupiscence included bodily
drives as well as desire for temporal things, desire for things able to be
taken away without loss contrary to man’s will, and desire for unnecessary
things.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>31</span> His own early

18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>him that he universalized this
experience as the nature and essence of all sin. In the fallen condition,
procreation takes place through the concupiscence that arose from original sin.
Augustine thought that reproduction would have occurred without desire if Adam
had not sinned. Concupiscent procreation fittingly correlates with the fallen
nature it perpetuates. Defective nature passes on through the lust that results
from defective nature.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>32</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sin and guilt were of two
kinds for Augustine. <u>Original guilt</u> attached to the human race as such
because of Adam’s original act of sin. <u>Personal guilt</u> attaches to the
individual person who sins because of the depraved nature he inherited
biologically from Adam.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>33</span> If
guilt comes from sinful action, the question arises of how a person today can
be guilty of Adam’s sinful action. An action cannot be inherited, so its guilt
cannot be inherited or transferred. The answer to this question lies in
Augustine’s concept of “federal man.” “Federal” refers to being part of a whole
in which autonomy does not exist for the parts. In political theory, for
example, a distinction is made between federation and confederation. A
confederation maintains the autonomy of the component state; a federation does
not. Similarly, in Augustine’s view mankind forms a federation of men who share
the guilt of the “federal crime” as all states share the responsibility for a “federal
atrocity” even though they take no part in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Biological procreation,
strictly speaking, does not <u>pass on</u> guilt, but <u>establishes connection
with</u> him who was guilty. Much of this thinking in Augustine stemmed from
the Latin mistranslation of Romans <b>5</b>:12. It reads <i>in quo</i> where
the Greek has </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐφ</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>’ </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ᾧ</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. <i>In quo</i> means <i>“in whom”</i> or <i>“by means
of whom,”</i> which represents a more restricted concept than the Greek “<i>because
of whom.”</i> <i>“Because of whom all sin”</i> leaves open the mode of
connection between present sinning and Adam’s sin. The association could be
through his <u>example and influence passed on socially</u>, through his <u>nature
passed on biologically</u>, or through <u>natal connection with him whom God
counted a sinner</u>.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>35</span> Even
if the <i>“in whom” </i>idea were accepted as the translation, Paul’s comments
do not include <u>how</u> men come to be <u>in</u> Adam. He simply describes
the difference between those in First Adam and those in Second Adam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Procreation, then, serves
two distinct, though related, functions in Augustine’s thought. Biological
reproduction (1) <u>passes on the defective form of nature</u> that produces
concupiscence, which in turn leads inevitably to <u>personal sin and guilt</u>.
Biological reproduction also (2) <u>establishes connection with original man</u>
so that each person automatically participates in his <u>original guilt</u>. All
subsequent men become extensions of the original man so that they are
extensions of him rather than parallel to him.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>36</span> Men differ from angels in this respect. God did not cast
out the obedient angels when he expelled the rebellious ones because they had
not descended from a common source.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>37</span> Procreation
in man relates to evil as a mechanism for transferring depravity and as a means
of connecting sinful Adam with present-day, “enlarged” Adam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine viewed man as a
corporate person as well as a group of persons and spoke of mankind as the <i>“mass
of humanity”</i> and <i>the “mass of perdition.”</i><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>38</span> Under this conception individuals partake of the
identity, and therefore the guilt, of the whole. Adam plus Eve were the human
race as well as the head of it. Mankind then was guilty of sin; increasing the
number of those in mankind does not cause the race to become more than mankind;
so new individuals are parts of the same old identity. Like reproduction by
fission in single-celled organisms, the new is just the old divided up and
enlarged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine developed his view
of mankind’s fallen condition from his understanding of Paul’s personal
experience described in Romans <b>7</b>:18, <i>“ . . . to will is with me, but
to do what is good is not.” </i>He distinguished between will and ability,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>39</span> indicating that will precedes
action.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>40</span> All people have the
ability to will, but they face an insurmountable difficulty when they attempt
to carry out what they have decided in their minds they ought to do. Concupiscence
causes this inability in the “members,” which work against the mind. The
perverted sense of desire that arises from the defective, “death-filled body”
overrides the free will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For this reason, Augustine
said that every man stands guilty for his own sins despite the fact that they
come from a deformed nature he does not voluntarily receive, <i>“Whatever be
the cause of willing, if it cannot be resisted no sin results from yielding to
it.”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>41</span> Since all men sin
personally, they must all have free will. A rock is not guilty of hurting
someone, because it cannot will to stop its own falling.<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>42</span> On this point Augustine used Aristotle’s
distinction between internal necessity and external compulsion. In many cases
necessity and compulsion cannot be differentiated because the original
internalization of the necessity was not voluntary. But Augustine, having
limited the definition of guilt to willful acts irrespective of the ability to
perform, found a way of calling a man guilty for what he could not help doing.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>43</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Augustine distinguished
between what amounts to practical <i>vs</i>. theoretical possibility and
between possibility and actuality.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>44</span> He
seems to have thought that escaping personal sin poses a <u>practical
impossibility</u> because mankind’s perverse sense of desire produces an
inability to fulfill the choice of the will. Escaping personal sin represents a
<u>theoretical possibility</u> insofar as mankind has what it takes to do good
if desire would “get out of the way.” Although it is a possibility,
righteousness will never occur as an actuality in this life, even with grace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The exact nature of this
conflict between will and desire is reflected in what is required to overcome
it. The inspiration of love helps the will to fulfill itself in action.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>45</span> In this respect Augustine
appears to have espoused an interpersonal-motivational model more than a
nature-change model, which is not what a person would expect, given the rest of
the theory that precedes this point in his thought. The defect and its
consequent desire are not removed in this life, but God’s grace dispensed in
the form of love can sufficiently empower a person to overcome the practice of
sin generally, though not perfectly.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>46</span></span></p>

18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As to nature, the <u>definition
of evil</u> centers on the form inseparably present in all nature. Evil is a
lack in this form. As to action, evil is the product of defective being. The <u>cause
of evil</u> is defective being. The <u>criterion of evil</u> is the form and
product of the undefective state of nature. As far as it may be known, the <u>origin
of evil</u> lay in a defective movement of free will in God’s creatures. Form
and content comprise a necessary composite, which in turn necessarily
correlates with evil or good depending on whether the form of being involves a
lack. Moral and natural evil inter-relate in that moral evil was punished with
natural evil; natural evil in turn perpetuates moral evil. Therefore, all evil—moral
as well as natural—stems from degenerate nature.</span></p>

this passage Augustine evidently commits the linguistic error called “reification.”
He confuses nominal reference with substantive being. <i>Avarice</i> describes
a characteristic attitude or way of feeling and behaving. The noun <i>avarice</i>
does not point to a thing in this case, but to a pattern of behavior. In his
analysis Augustine also apparently limits action to “movement,” or overt
action, instead of including non-movement, internal “functioning” like
disposition and attitude.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>:18:50. Augustine seems to have lacked precision as to
whether an unregenerate man will wish for, or ask for, deliverance from his
condition. In two passages where he speaks of the matter, he may not be talking
about a present unbeliever: <i>De perfectione iusticiae hominis</i> <b>10</b>:10;
<i>Enchiridion</i> 103. A different slant appears in <i>De praedestinatione
sanctorum</i> <b>5</b>:10: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>For
the capacity to have faith is of nature, is it also of nature to have it? ‘For
all men have not faith [2 Thessalonians <b>3</b>:2],’ although all men have the
capacity to have faith. . . . Accordingly, the capacity to have faith, as the
capacity to have love, belongs to man’s nature; but to have faith, even as to
have love, belongs to the grace of believers. </i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>He says elsewhere that belief is willed. John Calvin
later objected to Augustine for failing to emphasize sufficiently the effect of
sin on the mind and will themselves as seen in their not even wanting to do
good: <i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i> <b>2</b>:2:4.</span></p>

by exercising the will.</span></p>

(1) responsibility through a federal head, another instance of responsibility
for what someone cannot help doing is (2) responsibility through prior choice. A
person bears responsibility for what he does while he is drunk even though he
may not be “able” to keep from doing it at the time. He is responsible because
he could help getting himself into a state where he could not then help doing
wrong. The difference between these possibilities hinges on the concept of
federal man in the former. As an opposite to guilt through a federal head is
(3) responsibility by assignment. The law may hold the parent responsible for
his young child’s action he was not even present to control. Of course, the
reasons for so doing are practical rather than theoretical. The child does not
have the resources for payment of damages, for example, and the parent bears
responsibility for disciplining the child so that such actions do not recur.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Gerald Bonner, in <i>St. Augustine of
Hippo</i>, pp. 211-14, may be correct in suggesting that Augustine did not
abandon the intent of his earlier views on free will. (a) The total construct
can combine an emphasis on volition with an inability to act. (b) In his early
book against the Manichees, Augustine says that he is contemplating man as
unfallen: <i>De libero arbitrio</i> <b>3</b>:18:51-52 (cp. <b>3</b>:5:15). His
early problem with the Manichees had to do with the <u>origin</u> of sin; thus,
he was viewing man in his pristine condition. His later arguments with the
Pelagians dealt with the restoration of man; thus he was concerned with man in
his fallen condition. (c) In his <i>Retractationes</i> <b>1</b>:8 [9]:3 he at
least claims not to have changed his view on the matter.</span></p>

cannot change the sinner’s substance. The reversal of defect would seem to
require supernatural miracle on the very stance of a person.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>46</span>Again
Augustine’s thought seems imprecise. Perhaps the motivational-interpersonal
model was what he was trying to express in <i>De spiritu et litera</i> <b>33</b>:57-58
because for him belief was an act of the will. But the will to believe must be
given by God because he cites Paul as asking, <i>“What do you have that you did
not receive?”</i> (1 Corinthians<b> 4</b>:7). Belief must be mankind’s act too,
or God would be doing the believing. The will itself is neutral, and all men
have it (capacity); but to will good (content) must be given by God.</span></p>
