style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When
Paul speaks of sin resident within him (or indwelling sin), perhaps he means it
phenomenologically; that is, the experience of sin feels like something inside him.
His point is that sin is not just <u>something outside us</u> (environment,
influence) trying to tempt us into misaction; it is <u>something inside us</u>
as well. There is a subjective as well as objective component in the sin
phenomenon. The implication is personal responsibility for subjective response
to objective influence and stimulus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Within the subjective we can include <u>the
innate</u> and <u>the experiential</u>. The potentials based on the realities
that are genetically transmitted combine with the residue of our own past
action to create a bondage to sin that is more than the sheer action of sinning
itself. There is an <u>inclination to sin</u> before the <u>occasion to sin</u>
arrives; there is a lack of idealness in human “nature,” whether “nature” comes
from <u>inheritance</u> or <u>habit</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We are using “habit” here to cover <u>all
the residual effects of past sin</u> on present resolve. Habit contrasts with “inheritance,”
which covers everything that is genetically transferred. Habit addresses the sense
of “bondage” to sin, the experience Paul laments in Romans <b>7</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The innate and the experiential components
include the following (a) the morally neutral desires and capacities that are
genetically transferable and (b) the habits formed by past behavior. Habit
includes psychological and emotional patterns as well as evil ways of
fulfilling bodily desires that are themselves morally neutral. Even chemically
based irregularities, people are responsible for overriding with the will as
guided by values adopted with the mind—at least to the extent that they can do
so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul distinguishes between himself, the
true “me,” from this indwelling sin; but does not relieve himself of
responsibility for it. That implies that “sin-in-my-members” can be changed by
the true self in contrast to <u>super</u>natural change by external agency
through miracle. “Habit” describes what we do not control well and yet
something we can change, albeit not immediately, easily, or entirely (“Nobody’s
perfect”). Improvement over habits takes deliberate action to resist and
overcome. Paul’s “true me” may be the aspiring self in contrast to the experiencing
self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As to the unchangeable factor in the
subjective side, God takes a benevolent attitude: <i>“he understands our frame.”</i>
Jesus understood somewhat the sleepiness of the apostles in the Garden. But as to
the changeable aspects, God demands human responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Today we have an increased appreciation for
the genetic component of human behavior in areas that vary between persons. The
chemical make-up of some individuals may dispose them more easily to anger,
impatience, hyperactivity, laziness, lack of self-control. An element of
relativity comes in by the differences between people. Today we also have a
correspondingly higher responsibility because research has isolated the genetic
components of certain behavior tendencies or extremes and has developed
antidotes for some of them. Now we have the responsibility based on <u>knowledge</u>
to take our “medicine.” </span></p>
