<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Interpersonal capacity” includes three
notable ideas about the image. (a) Inter<u>personal</u> stresses the fact that
the image of God has to do with characteristics of persons rather than that of
things, forces, ideas, <i>etc</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           (b) <u>Inter</u>personal relates the image
to the social setting so that it involves more than the individual by
addressing marriage, community, church, society, mankind as well as the
purposes of God for us.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The third point lies in the word (c) <u>capacity</u>.
Speaking of interpersonal “capacity” distinguishes potential from actual. As
attitude is more basic than action, so capacity is more basic than function.
The inner and the potential are the “heart” from which spring the issues of
life. We are in God’s image even when we are not actually relating to another
person, even if our relating has some impersonal, even sinful, aspects to it. “Capacity”
does not put the image at any particular “level.” It is not identified with
individual person, the “sub-individual” (rationality, “spirit”), or the
corporate (marriage, society). The following observations lead to the
conclusion that the image of God is the interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

for the Image as Interpersonal Capacity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Out of the <u>nature of God</u>
comes the <u>purpose of God</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Out of the <u>purpose of God</u>
comes the <u>purpose of man</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>          Out of the <u>purpose of man</u> comes the <u>nature
of man</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The interpersonal purpose of man implies interpersonal
capacity in man. As the purpose of anything determines its nature and design,
so the purpose of man determines the nature and design of man. The reason God
made us establishes guidelines for the way God made us. He created us for
fellowship and mission; consequently, he created us with capacities that enable
us to relate and be responsible. He made us able to love and be loved; he made
us capable of fulfilling mission mandates (dominion and proclamation). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The origin of anything determines its
meaning and nature: “Your ‘roots’ define you.” God created mankind God in God’s
image, and that makes all the difference. The situation with us is not so much
that nature determines use or purpose, but <i>vice versa</i>. If something
already exists, what it is like determines what it can do and what it can be
for. In God’s case, for example, his purpose(s) arise from his nature because
he is eternal. He that alone is without beginning of days determines his own
purpose on the basis of what he is. We were created by another; so we had a
beginning that manifested the purpose of the creating Other. As Paul said in a
different connection, <i>“By the <u>grace</u> of God ‘I am what I am’”</i>;
what we are comes from the “grace” of Another. But when God said, <i>“I am what
I am,”</i> he spoke of himself as ultimate reality. Because we have a beginning
through creation by him, our nature communicates his purposes, which make us
interpersonal. From the beginning, interpersonal purposes have been associated
with the image of God in us; consequently, the purposes that imply
interpersonal capacity cause us to identify that capacity with what it means to
be created in God’s image. We come <u>from God</u> by <u>creation</u> in the <u>image
of God</u>: purpose, origin, nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The “Dominion Mandate”: Responsible Being</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Commission</u>. In connection with the
statement about creating us in God’s image, we received a commission to take
responsibility for the earth and everything in it. In the creation account, the
<u>responsibility</u> implied by “dominion” is worded in direct association with
God’s image in us (Genesis <b>1</b>:26-28; cp. Psalm <b>8</b>). We were to till
the ground (Genesis<b> 2</b>:5) and dress and keep the Garden (<b>2</b>:15). In
the Great Commission we are to call fellowmen back into fellowship with God
(Matthew <b>28</b>:19-20, <i>etc</i>.). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Covenant</u>. After God destroyed the
human race, he made a covenant with the family of Noah and his descendants that
he would never again destroy us with a universal flood. An agreement with
promises and conditions takes place between persons and guides their
interaction. Impersonal reality operates by built-in natural “law,” but persons
make covenants with one another. Personal behaviors like trust and love
accompany such arrangements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Interpersonal capacity participates in the
covenants God has made with us. Covenant combines <u>responsibility and
fellowship</u>. As far back as Genesis <b>2</b>, God’s covenant name Yahveh
appears in the account of establishing our relationship to the plant world (<b>2</b>:4-17),
the animal world (<b>2</b>:19-20), and the human world (<b>2</b>:18, 21-25).
Later came the rainbow covenant (<b>9</b>:1-17), the Abrahamic covenant, the
Mosaic covenant, and so forth. <u>Fellowship</u> with God shows up in the
terminology for his people—sons of God, friends of God, <i>etc</i>.; in his
communication with us, and in the goal of having the tabernacle of God with us
(Revelation <b>21</b>:3).                                                          </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           For two reasons we understand the nature of
mankind as the interpersonal capacity. We reason from our interpersonal <u>purpose</u>
to our interpersonal <u>nature</u>. Since the thought pattern reasons from
purpose to nature, it moves from demonstrating interpersonal purpose to
inferring interpersonal nature. Elsewhere, we lay out arguments for summarizing
under interpersonalism God’s reasons for making us. As our distinctive nature, interpersonality
ties to the meaning of the expression “image of God” because Genesis uses that
expression to characterize our nature. So, the image of God is the
interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Responsibility and accountability are
interpersonal phenomena. Fellowship implies likeness to the “other,” and
responsibility assumes abilities that can fulfill purpose for the “other.”
Since the Genesis text associates them with the <i>imago dei</i> terminology,
they argue for the image as interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           God made us <u>to have fellowship</u> and <u>to
be stewards</u>. The first is existential and the second is eschatological. The
first has to do with our present situation; the second has to do with where we
are going. Together they comprise the primary dimensions of interpersonal
existence. They both require personhood and equally contribute to personal
meaningfulness. We are to walk with God, in the first case, and to be stewards
of his handiwork and grace, in the second case. Within that second case, we are
stewards of the grace of God whether the common grace of creation or the proffered
grace of redemption (1 Corinthians <b>4</b>:1-2; Titus <b>1</b>:7; 1 Peter <b>4</b>:10).
Accordingly, we glorify him by fulfilling the management mandate and the
mission mandate. When we do those things, we have fellowship with him, and he
meets our needs (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:6-11); so there is an interplay between
the main aspects of human experience. The image as interpersonal capacity
harmonizes nicely with these basic aspects of human existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:-.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                       <i>“Let’s make humankind in our
image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish in the sea,
the birds in the sky, the cattle, all the earth, and everything that moves on
the earth.” And God created people in his own image; in the image of God he
created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them and said, “Be
fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it.” </i>(Genesis<b> 1</b>:26-28a).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           We reason from the interpersonal nature of <u>God</u>
to the interpersonal nature of <u>mankind</u> that he created in his likeness.
This second approach derives from scripture’s most programmatic statement about
human nature: created in the image of <u>God</u>. If God is interpersonal and people
are interpersonal, we expect interpersonal capacity to be associated with our
being created God’s image. Our interest in the expression “image of God” serves
the larger concern to show that our nature is interpersonal. We need not labor
the point that God is personal being, but the materials below do highlight
certain data in the creation account that belong to that understanding of him.
It is obvious on all accounts that the God of the Bible has the characteristics
and behaviors we associate with personhood. He has rationality, affection,
volition, and self-transcendence. He cares (love), communicates, behaves
ethically (holiness), <i>etc</i>. We know from experience that we also have
those capacities and can do those same behaviors. So we know that we are like
him in those respects. It remains only to associate that set of shared traits
with the “image” expression; it is in the “image of <u>God</u>” that we are
created.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Plurality in unity</u>. One observation that
highlights the interpersonal character of humankind is the parallelism between
the pronouns <u>us</u> and <u>them</u>: <i>“Let <u>us</u> make mankind in <u>our</u>
image . . . and let <u>them</u> have dominion . . . .”</i> As “us” shows
plurality on the side of the creator, “them” shows plurality on the side of the
created. “Us” creates “them.” <i>“Let <u>us</u> make man in <u>our</u> image”</i>
reflects the interpersonal character of God himself (cp. <b>3</b>:22; 11:7;
Isaiah <b>6</b>:8). Even if Genesis had just said that God created us in his
image, we could have inferred that “image of God” included interpersonal
capacity because Christianity understands that God is interpersonal. But the
creation account brings that point in more explicitly by describing the creator
as “us” and “our.” Accordingly, we take “us” as a reference to <u>the
three-person oneness of God</u> commonly called “trinity. Except for the four “us”
passages that hint at the triunity of God in the Old Testament, nothing very
explicit about trinity is revealed until we get to the New Testament. From the
New Testament we read trinity back into these relatively ambiguous texts in the
Old (John <b>14</b>:16, <i>e.g</i>.). “Us” and “our” presumably refer to God
and therefore to his triunity since no one else has appeared so far in Genesis
and since “majestic plural” does not account for Genesis <b>3</b>:22 (“<u>one
of</u> us”). The fact that we have interpersonal capacity derives from the
interpersonal nature of God who made us in his own image. God’s nature
establishes ours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Diversity in unity</u>. Another
observation that highlights our interpersonal character is the correlation
between “us” and “male-female.” Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27 parallels <i>“let <u>us</u>
make humankind in <u>our</u> image”</i> and <i>“in the image of God he created <u>them</u>,”</i>
on the one hand, with <i>“<u>male and female</u> he created <u>them</u>,” </i>on
the other. The image evidently relates in some way—indirectly, formally, or
analogously—to the male-female nature of humanness. The image harmonizes with
bisexual interpersonalism. Since God is spirit (John <b>4</b>:24), physicality
and sexuality <i>per</i> <i>se</i> are not the point We can say that the
plurality-in-oneness of marriage is <u>analogous to</u> the
plurality-in-oneness of trinity rather than the <u>same as</u> or <u>included
in</u> it. “Same as” would degenerate the situation back to what ancient paganism
portrayed in its male and female deities. “Included in” would picture deity as
somehow a combination of male and female traits. God transcends the
masculine-feminine variable. Marriage is comparable to trinity in that (a)
marriage provides the most intense, permanent, all-inclusive interpersonal
relationship that human experience affords. Marriage has the character it does
primarily because in it we most distinctively demonstrate the intense,
permanent, all-inclusive oneness of the godhead. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Analogy to marriage also lies in the fact
that (b) male-female epitomizes interpersonalism across diversity. The image is
not just unity-in-plurality; it is unity in diversity. Beyond transaction and
interaction in a plurality of individuals, diversity leads to
complementariness, interdependency, hierarchy, compenetration, overlapping
capacities. Paul uses the body figure to illustrate characteristics like these
in the church (Romans <b>12</b>:4-8; 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:4-30; Ephesians <b>4</b>:4,
15-16; cp. <b>1</b>:22-23; Colossians<b> 2</b>:19). Within both the human and
divine, there are differences in and between the individuals that make up the
categories—differences perhaps in talents, interests, statuses, and roles that
combine to form the whole and unite to achieve the goal. The work of the
Father, Son, and Spirit variously stresses the initiating, creating,
sustaining, redeeming, sanctifying functions within their combined operation.
Likewise, within their very constitutions, male and female are diversely gifted
for fellowship, for multiplying and subduing the earth, for fulfilling the
mission mandate. Diversity in <u>inborn talents</u> leads to diversity in <u>developed
skills</u> and conceivably to diversity in <u>supernatural gifts</u>. What is
true between male-female is true between persons in the same “mode” of the
image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Walking with God</u>. Genesis <b>1-3</b>
pictures God in direct relationship with our first parents. He walked with them
in the Garden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. Specific Human Capacities That Combine to Produce
the Image as Interpersonal Capacity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           We reason from specifics in the creation
account to the meaning of the <i>imago dei</i> expression used there to define us.
We expect that human distinctives present in that account correlate with
descriptions found there. These particulars naturally relate to the
interpersonal capacity we previously inferred from God’s reasons for creating us
and from the nature of God in whose image he made us. Even as interpersonal
character seems to account for the particulars in these other two topics, so it
seems to account for the human distinctives observed in the creation account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The thought moves from the particulars of
one topic to the overall picture, back to the particulars of a related topic,
to the same overall picture, and so forth. For our part, interpersonalism
accounts for the <u>reasons for creating people</u> and for particulars in the <u>nature
of God</u>. It fits with the parallelism between “us” and “them.” Now we posit
interpersonalism as what accounts for other particulars associated with the
expression “image of God.” Interpersonalism naturally accounts for an
increasing number of topics associated with mankind. As that number increases,
we gain confidence that the characteristics of personal relationship form the
proper frame of reference for Christian anthropology and provide the ultimate
frame of reference for the Christian worldview. At the same time, we gain
confidence that interpersonalism correctly accounts for each topic we
previously associated with it along the way. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>“God Said-Satan Said”: Communicative Being </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Revelation</u>. One distinguishing
feature between us and the rest of “this creation” is the ability to carry on
word communication, which is based on symbolic thought. When God created man
and woman, he communicated to them their role in relation to the rest of
creation. Their operation was not genetically <u>encoded into</u> them but <u>communicated</u>
<u>to</u> them. They received revelation to the effect that they were not to
eat fruit from the tree of knowledge in the middle of the Garden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Naming the animals</u>. In preparing
Adam to see that nothing in the animal kingdom corresponded with him, God had
him name the animals. Adam was made with such capacity that he could fulfill
that task. He could differentiate and categorize.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Influence</u>. When Satan approached
Eve, he illustrated in mankind the ability to be influenced by words. Influence
contrasts with force as an interpersonal way to affect behavior. It appeals to
the emotions, thoughts, and conscience to persuade people to use the will in
the ways the influencer desires. People can be deceived by information,
arguments, and projected possibilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           What Satan did with Eve is essentially what
Eve did with Adam. Scripture says that Adam was not deceived (1 Timothy <b>2</b>:14),
but it appears that he illustrated mankind’s ability to be moved by the
preference and belief of someone loved. Even if we “know better,” the power of
another personality can suffice to override our better judgment. In short, people’s
ability to be tempted by beauty and pride relates to their interpersonal
character. People have the capacity for communication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           By setting up a situation in which Adam and
Eve were supposed to do certain things and forbidden to do others, God put them
in the “morality matrix.” They <u>were to</u> exercise dominion over the animal
kingdom (<b>1</b>:26-30) and the plant kingdom (<b>2</b>:5-9). They <u>were not
to</u> eat from the “tree of knowledge.” Morality and ethics address
interpersonal circumstances because they have to do with values/ideas, which people
are not externally compelled to do or internally programmed to do. They can
choose to apply or not apply a principle of interaction with another person
relative to some purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The coming of a sense of nakedness
accompanied the disobedience in the Garden. Being self-conscious is a
phenomenon of conscience that relates to people’s unique characteristic of
blushing. The <u>sense</u> of guilt is largely an interpersonal phenomenon,
which Adam and Eve reflected in hiding themselves from God (Genesis <b>3</b>:7-8)
after they sinned. From the subjective side, they distanced themselves from
God. From the objective side, God removed them from the Garden where they had
previously walked with him (<b>3</b>:8; cp.<b> 5</b>:21; <b>6</b>:9; <b>17</b>:1;<b>
24</b>:40; <b>48</b>:15). Going out from his presence (<b>3</b>:8; cp. <b>4</b>:16)
was a kind of separation, and separation is an interpersonal phenomenon that
occurs because of inappropriate behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Mankind has the capacity for morality,
which is part and parcel of what it means to be a person. So moral requirement
implies that the image consists of interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

theologians have given extensive thought to the interpretation of Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27
and related texts: <i>“Let’s make humankind in our image after our likeness.” </i>Traditionally
there have been four proposed aspects of the “image of God” together with their
subunits and effects. Reason has headed the list because it relates to so many
derivative capacities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Will</u>. The human will enables choice
between alternatives. People are not limited to a stimulus-response existence
where response answers the strongest stimulus in the environment. Will relates
to choice and therefore purpose and implies something about motives and
motivation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Conscience</u>. People can sense guilt,
which Genesis <b>3 </b>pictures as nakedness. Conscience references to persons and
their values. The pangs of conscience often do not bother us unless someone
faces us with our failure to honor shared standards. Conscience responds to the
<u>person</u> who gave the commandment or the <u>person</u> with whom we share
a breached behavioral value. Conscience responds to a face. Guilt indicated by
a bothered conscience results from two relational factors: (1) the lack of
correlation between behavior and a standard for behavior plus (2) the lack of
correlation between one person’s behavior and the expectations of other persons
who share that standard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Conscience is not itself an exact standard for
performance but a sense of inconsistency between standard and performance, or
more exactly, between expected standard and actual performance. Conscience
operates relative to ingrained more than inborn values. Conscience is educated
by experience in the context of persons. It does not function relative to items
not known or agreed to. People can pass lie detector tests if their values
differ from the item being tested. People’s conscience can begin to bother them
later about a past action they did not know or believe was bad when they did
it. The ability to feel guilty retroactively is especially characteristic of
persons. A person can even feel guilty about something in front of someone else
he loves and respects even though he may not think doing it is wrong. These
kinds of experiences show that conscience and a sense of guilt are not just in
reference to abstract values, which in themselves are interpersonal; they are
even more interpersonal than that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Affection</u>. Emotion distinguishes people
from much of the created realm because they care, have feelings and emotions, and
experience affection for other persons. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <u>Spirit</u>. People have a <u>spirit</u>,
something that continues after their body dies. Traditionally they have been
regarded as created in God’s image because they have rational, volitional,
ethical, emotional, and spiritual capacities. These irreducible, simple
capacities combine variously to create the complex ones that appear below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The great variability in people derives
from reason, will, and power. Reason lies behind imagination to “create” what
is not there yet. Satan appealed to that capacity when he tempted Eve with the
prospects of being wise like God. Mind altered values in this case. Will
enables a person to respond differently from the implications of personal
influence or physical stimulus. Power refers to the ability to carry out
choice. Mankind therefore is a much less determined creation than the
inorganic, plant, and animal kingdoms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Abstract thought relates to the capacity
for language communication, creativity, self-transcendence, self-awareness,
self-objectification, responsibility (dominion/ mission), and even humor. People
can penetrate a situation in thought and imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           A human person is not a “dumb brute.”
Animals can do what might be called “communication,” but they do not
communicate through language systems. Their communication is genetically based
and transmitted and operates in stimulus-response fashion. Human language,
however, is rationally based and <u>culturally transmitted</u>. In fact,
language is a function of a culture. It is <u>specialized</u> to the interests,
needs, characteristics, and perceptions of a particular society. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Human language is <u>hierarchically
structured</u> in that it has levels—sounds (phonemes) that grammar relates
together (morphemes) to create words; groupings of words to make phrases,
clauses, sentences, and the like (tagmemes). Language has “deep structure,”
which corresponds to the categories of formal analysis. Animal communication
has one “level,” and there is no grammar between parts; that is, its elements
do not form a “system” of interdependent phonemes, morphemes, and tagmemes. Instead,
there is a set group of separate sounds. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Human language is <u>arbitrary</u> since
there is no inherent connection between the linguistic item and what it refers
to, which is partially what is meant by saying that human language is “symbolic.”
By “dancing,” bees tell the other bees where a source of nectar is located. The
bees’ flight movements are “iconic”; they indicate the direction and distance
to the source of nectar. They form a map in the air. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Human language is <u>imaginative</u> in
that it is not based on external reality itself but on the speaker’s
conceptualization of it. People can lie (contradictory to reality); talk about
unicorns (contrary to reality); communicate things of the past, the future, the
distant, the imperceivable—things that require “trust” for the hearer to come
to know about and believe in (displaced reality). Either by place, time, or
perception, there is separation between the speaker/hearer and the topic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Human language is <u>creative</u> in the
sense that it generates new words, sounds, and combinations; it evolves. In
this way, whole new language systems emerge and thousands of such systems
currently exist in flux, some seven thousand of them. Animal language is static
rather than dynamic. All members of the same species use the same sounds for
the same “meaning,” and new systems do not emerge. The distinctiveness of human
language is one of the most important indicators of human uniqueness over
animals, which correlates with people’s being in the image of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The rational capacity enables
self-transcendence, self-awareness, self-objectification, imagination, and the
like, which take part in interpersonal existence. People’s transcendent
capacity relates to an ability to project their viewpoint over behind the eyes
of others and consider what the situation looks like from there. Mead said that
self emerges only when a person can take the role of the “generalized other”
and look back on the self. Self-awareness comes from interaction with other
selves. Only in the social circumstance can the self define itself as a self. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           From that same context comes our
self-image, which depends largely on the feedback we get from other persons. Social

possible by the rational capacity together with other capacities to comprise

Interpersonal Capacity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(1)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>provides for a holistic understanding of man</u>. On the positive
side, humankind is in the image of God. The text says that the man was created
in the image of God; it does not say that the image of God is <u>in</u> man.
The latter phraseology might suggest that the image applies to less than
everything a person is. Furthermore, in saying that mankind was created in God’s
image, Genesis does not say people were created in God’s image in a certain
respect. The implication is that <u>mankind</u> is in the image of God, not
that we have some trait like God’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           On the negative side, there are several
disadvantages to identifying the image with the sub-individual level. The first
is that <b>(a)</b> identifying the image with rationality or volition, <i>etc</i>.,
is not exegetical. Such identifications lack direct bases in the <i>imago dei</i>
texts themselves. Interpreters are not drawing the meaning for image out of the
text first and then correlating it with human experience or other scripture. They
start with correlation between the biblical expression and human experience—in
this case the experience of rationality in contrast to the observed lack or
minimal presence of it in other physical creations. Whenever exegesis from the
text can precede correlation with other texts or with experience, exegesis
should take priority. It is not always possible to find something in the “near
context” to explain a point of interest in a passage. In such cases, we look at
the “distant context” in the rest of revelation and “the nature of the case” as
inferred from experience to see what “fits with” the issue. Such cases involve
a “correspondence” approach to interpretation: “this is that” (cp. Acts <b>2</b>:16).
But this latter approach increases the likelihood of error or irrelevance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Interpretation should follow a pattern of
induction, deduction, and integration. We have tried to begin exegetically,
then make inferences, and then generalize and integrate with other particulars
to arrive at an understanding of the <i>imago dei</i> that fits in the
Christian worldview. Thus, we have taken the image as people’s interpersonal
capacity in a worldview that organizes itself around interpersonalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           An exegetical approach here produces a
holistic and functional understanding of the image more than an analytical and
static one. Traditional proposals about the image of God offer some significant
insights into human nature, but Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27 suggests the larger and
more basic truth we have correlated with interpersonalism. Reason, will,
conscience, affection, and spirit do belong to the image, not because
individually any one of them is the image, but because they help make the image
possible; they make interpersonalism possible. They are capacities necessary
for relating interpersonally; we may call them “aspects of the image,” not the
image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Besides lacking contextual foundation in
Genesis, another disadvantage to identifying the image with rationality or
volition is that it is <b>(b)</b> <u>reductionistic</u>, which is contrary to
the nature of the case. We are more than mind or will or conscience or emotion
or spirit. We possess a combination of these and more—a gestalt. In the <i>imago
dei</i> of Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27 we prefer to include all the creatable
characteristics common to God and us. The limitation “creatable” applies
because holiness, for example, derives from behavior, not being. Substance can
be created, but action cannot—although by a figure of speech in deterministic
settings we might speak of creating an action. We might say that someone
created an action by creating something that had to act in a certain way. Since
we have rationality and volition, there is not a one-for-one relationship
between being and behavior; so behavioral qualities cannot be created
indirectly in a kind of substance that would necessitate holiness.                                         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Mankind’s wholeness extends to more than
the characteristics we share with God (physicality, sexuality, corruptibility,
and the like), but there is no reason to exclude any <u>shared</u> likenesses
at least and no harm in including the others. People are not one irreducible
something from which everything else “unpacks.” Philosophically that would be “foundationalism”
in contrast to “combinationalism.” In the latter case, the thinker <u>starts</u>
with a basic unit and frame of reference that is comprised of more primary
elements. Reason, affection, and the like are individual capacities that form a
gestalt, that is, a whole that is more than the sum of such parts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           A third disadvantage to identifying the
image with rationality, <i>etc</i>., is that it is (c) <u>simplistic</u>. It
fosters a faculty psychology comparable to “bean-bag genetics,” as if a human being
were a series of parts that individually produced the conscience, the will, the
affections, thoughts, and so forth. The complexity level is too low for what we
need to describe. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           A fourth disadvantage is that (d) it is <u>analytical
and static</u> rather than synthetic and dynamic. Conceiving of the image as
rationality plus volition plus conscience plus affection fragments the person. It
loses the gestalt that a human person is. The whole of us is more than the sum
of our parts even if all the parts are recognized and listed. In a real whole
there are further considerations beyond sheer quantity; there are qualitative
features like relationship, unity, interaction, hierarchy, and beauty. Identifying
the image with interpersonal capacity avoids <u>reducing</u> persons to one
essence or <u>fragmenting</u> them into a series of parts conceived of in
static terms. It fosters functional wholeness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Holism can exist without having to keep in
the image forever everything mankind now is. Such is the case because the same
effect can conceivably come from more than one “source.” God and angels can be
interpersonal as spirit beings (John <b>4</b>:24; Hebrews <b>1</b>:14; Luke <b>24</b>:39)
and human beings can be interpersonal on physical bases. Brain may be able to
produce mind epiphenomenally, but mind may not have to come from brain or “reside
on” brain. Theologically the concern is practical effect more than ontic cause
and analysis. Because we believe in an <u>omnipotent</u> God with ultimate <u>authority</u>,
we can believe that he is <u>free</u> to will that mind exist on some other
basis besides brain or on no basis at all. He <u>can</u> transform the physical
into what is not physical and “re-connect” mind with a “new body,” as in
resurrection, translation, transubstantiation, re-creation, or some other form
of miracle. How he has done or will do those connections we cannot know, and
yet it is ours to know that we are in his image. The image of God that we have
is something we can know in a functional sense and do not have to include
unknowable factors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           We are concerned about wholeness because
scripture presents mankind holistically. It speaks of the <u>redemption</u> of
the whole person. Although a part of us dies, resurrection (or translation)
remedies even that loss. People do not become less than people when they die. <u>Individual
statements of scripture</u> consider the flesh as part of us, as Paul implies
in Romans <b>7</b>:18: <i>“I know that nothing good resides in me, that is, in
my flesh.”</i> In the context Paul bemoans the conflict that goes on in his
members. He is both part of them (<b>7</b>:18) and above them (<b>7</b>:20);
so, the mind/spirit/transcendent nature should predominate, but it includes
that over which it predominates instead of being parallel to it. The biblical
picture of mankind does not suggest dualism in the normal sense of that term
because the higher and lower natures are not in contrast or parallel, but in
hierarchy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Holism can put too much in the image while
honoring God’s image can work against holism. The image as interpersonal
capacity avoids these extremes by establishing a context that can incorporate
everything in us and our relationships at least indirectly. That interpersonal
context qualifies every aspect of our being and behavior and relationship which
manifest that capacity. Flesh becomes interpersonal flesh; sexuality becomes
interpersonal sexuality; marriage becomes interpersonal intimacy. Although such
factors may not be inherently necessary to the image, they are included in it
for now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(2)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>establishes our attitude toward the physical body</u>. God created us
in his own image in the physical state (Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27), blessed us (<b>1</b>:28),
and pronounced us very good in that state (<b>1</b>:31); the physical body was
part of that. In the biblical view, the material realm relates to the spiritual
realm as positive to positive (<b>1</b>:10, 12, 18, 21, 25; cp. <b>1</b>:22,
28; <b>9</b>:1; cp. Psalm <b>104</b>:28; <b>119</b>: 68), not as negative to
positive. The human body relates to the human spirit positively. The lower
nature does not relate to the higher as negative to positive. Since the
material realm derived by creation from the spiritual realm that preceded it,
matter is <u>not parallel</u> to spirit or <u>opposed</u> to it, but <u>positively
secondary</u> to it and <u>functionally incorporated</u> under it. The material
<u>manifests</u> the spiritual (Psalm <b>19</b>:1) and serves as an <u>instrument</u>
for accomplishing spiritual purposes. Likewise, the human body is not parallel
to the human spirit or opposed to it, but positively secondary to it. The body
manifests the spirit and serves to accomplish its purposes. As a result, the
image as interpersonal capacity sets our attitude toward ourselves in the
physical state as persons in fellowship, not as animals in herds or chemicals
in clusters. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Characteristics of the relationship between
spiritual and material realms establish guidelines for understanding the
spiritual and material aspects of us. There have been three approaches to the
body relative to the spirit. (a) The body is evil and the spirit is good
(Stoicism, Epicureanism, Gnosticism). The body is “the prison house of the
soul,” a negative-to-positive view. (b) The body is amoral, and the spirit does
not exist (materialism). The physical realm is all there is. (c) The spirit is
predominant, and the body subordinate (Christian). Scripture implies this last
viewpoint since a good God created matter including the human body and made it
an aspect of the mankind he commissioned to take care of the other matter God
created. The doctrine of creation and the fact of commission establish the
positive character of the material universe and all its parts. In our physical
humanness we can have fellowship with a holy God and can participate in the
responsibilities such a God gives us. A positive attitude toward the physical
body fits with the positive attitude toward physicality in general. The
biblical religion does not teach that matter is evil, so the material body is
not evil either. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Positive attitude toward the body relates
to an ethic that uses the physical body for spiritual ends. The behavioral
implication is that we not <u>satiate</u> the body as in Epicureanism (cp.
Philippians <b>3</b>:19), that we not <u>depreciate</u> it as in asceticism
(cp. Colossians <b>3</b>:23), that we not <u>glorify</u> it as in humanism, but
that we <u>transcend</u> it. We keep the body in secondary position (1
Corinthians <b>9</b>:27; Romans <b>8</b>:13; <b>12</b>:1-2), using it as an
instrument for good guided by transcendent values of spirit and mind and
directed toward divine purposes and fellowship. The body can be viewed as a <u>temple</u>
of the Spirit (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:13-19; cp. Mark<b> 14</b>:58), as a <u>vessel</u>
for spiritual treasures (1 Thessalonians <b>4</b>:4; cp. Acts<b> 9</b>:15; 2
Corinthians <b>4</b>:7; 2 Timothy <b>2</b>:20; 1 Peter <b>3</b>:7), as a temple
and <u>tabernacle</u> of the soul/spirit (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:1, 4; 2 Peter <b>1</b>:13-14),
as an <u>instrument</u> of righteousness for glorifying God (Romans<b> 6</b>:7;
1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:13; Colossians <b>2</b>:17).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Positive attitude toward the physical body
relates to several other biblical doctrines and phenomena that presuppose it. Incarnation,
divine indwelling, theophanies, anthropomorphisms, and creation in the image of
God do not degrade deity; they dignify humanity. The doctrine of <u>creation</u>
itself correlates with the idea that the creation is in some sense good—or at
least not evil (Genesis <b>1</b>:31, <i>etc</i>.). There is no contradiction
between prohibiting idolatry and relating the image to the body if spirit
directs body. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Physical humanness in the image allows for <u>incarnation</u>
without incarceration or dualism. For first-century Jewish religious leaders,
the offense in Jesus’ claim to deity lay not only in their fear of polytheism,
but in their abhorrence of making God too imminent. They stressed his
transcendence of God and the ineffableness of his name to the point that they
did not even pronounce Yahveh. Even today in the reading of the Hebrew
scriptures, Jewish people read <i>Adonai</i> (“my Lord”) or occasionally <i>Elohim</i>
(“God”) in place of the tetragrammaton. New Testament writers did not challenge
this hyper-sensitivity; they regularly use <i>kyrios</i> (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>κύριος</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, “Lord”)
for referring to him. For Jews incarnation made God too imminent. But if
interpersonal capacity capsulizes the shared nature of God and man, then Jesus
was not an artificial combination of deity and humanity and the flesh did not
imprison the deity in him during the incarnation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Later Judaism had difficulty with <u>anthropomorphisms</u>,
expressions that assign human characteristics to what is not human. Old
Testament scripture, however, is replete with phraseology about God’s hands,
right hand, fingers, eyes. It freely speaks of him as “getting up early.” Semitic
idiom used body parts symbolically for psychological, abstract, and intangible
realities; and in scripture it did so with God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Physical humanness in the image allows for <u>indwelling</u>.
It pictures the body as a temple for the spirit rather than a prison for the
soul. Indwelling means that the transforming influence of God fully permeates
to the inner character of the human self, from which springs the issues of
life. Whether the indwelling is locational or just pictured as locational,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>the implication remains that God’s
being with us and in us (John <b>14</b>:17) does not grate on spiritual
sensitivities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Physical humanness in the image allows for <u>physical
death</u> without losing the higher nature and for <u>physical life</u> without
tainting it. Scripture never says we lose the image when we die, and we have it
while we live. The image does not require any circumstance of its
manifestation. The body manifests the human person in much the same way as the
incarnation manifested the second person of the trinity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Positive attitude toward the body allows
for the <u>resurrection</u> of the body (both Christ’s and ours), not just
immortality of the soul. Resurrection was foolishness to Gentiles (Acts <b>17</b>:31-32,
18; cp. 1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:23) because they typically believed in a dualism
that depreciated matter or made it evil. Resurrection of the body as
distinguished from immortality of the soul affirms the dignity of physical
humanness and the fundamental meaningfulness of life in our present condition. Even
though we do not know exactly what resurrection is, it must be more than
immortality of the soul. In resurrection, there is at least <u>re-identification</u>
with the material realm and the kind of physical body we have now. Resurrection
is more than the resuscitation of a dead corpse because metamorphosis,
transformation, transfiguration occurs even for those alive at Christ’s coming
(1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:50-54). That <u>transformation</u> involves the change
to asexual being since there is no marriage in the resurrection (Matthew <b>22</b>:30).
But resurrection and transformation both involve <u>continuity</u> between the
earthly, physical body and the spiritual, heavenly one (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:42-54).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(3)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>provides the theological foundation for interpreting sexuality</u>.
It implies a positive view of sexuality, affirms the equal worth of both sexes
(Galatians <b>3</b>:28), and defines the proper relationship between them (1
Corinthians <b>6</b>:13-20). Sexuality represents a variable within the image
since both sexes have interpersonal capacity and equally so. This variance is
subsumed under the larger truth of the divine image common to both and expressed
in the union of the two (Genesis <b>2</b>:24). Sexuality along with its
physicality is a non-essential part of human wholeness. What is variable is not
essential, and we have concluded that the essence of image is interpersonal
capacity. That is a little different from defining what is the essence of
humanness since interpersonal capacity applies to a range of created and
uncreated kinds. Since in the resurrection marriage does not take place, we
infer that sexuality does not continue; yet in the resurrection humans do not
cease to be human nor to be in the image of God. So, on this side of
death-resurrection, sexuality does not represent a variable of sufficient
degree or kind as to constitute a basis for variously valuing the one mode of
the image over the other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Physicality, sexuality, procreation are
evidently at least related to, analogous to, governed by, or exhibitive of, the
<i>imago dei</i> since scripture makes the same connection terminologically
between Adam and Seth as between God and Adam. <i>“In the day that God created
man, he made him in the likeness of God; he created them male and female. . . .
Adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begot a son in his own likeness,
after his image”</i> (Genesis <b>5</b>:1-3; cp. <b>1</b>:26-27); Luke’s
genealogy of Jesus concludes with <i>“. . . Enos, the son of Seth, the son of
Adam, the son of God” </i>(<b>3</b>:37). Paul calls man the <i>“</i>[God’s] <i>offspring</i>
[</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>γένος</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>genos</i>]<i>”</i> (Acts <b>17</b>:28-29). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Procreation takes place in all organisms,
which reproduce after their kind; so we might be inclined to separate
procreation from image considerations entirely. But the image consists of more
than the peculiarities of man <i>vs.</i> animal. More importantly, the
interpersonal image transforms the character of everything in its context,
including reproduction. God intended human sexuality to be interpersonal rather
than purely biological as reflected in the fact that man is unique in being
able to reproduce face to face and in the fact that sex has more than a
reproductive purpose. It involves commitment to common identity, values, and
purposes; so compenetration of personalities precedes compenetration of
physical natures. In light of this point, we note that the Jewish idiom for
sexual intercourse is “knowing,” which uses personal terminology. Relating
sexuality to deity through the image in man does not mean God has sexuality but
that man’s sexuality operates in an interpersonal context as an expression of
interpersonal capacity, reaffirms interpersonal identity, and has to do with
commitment to values and purposes more than drives. The image precedes
sexuality; so human and animal reproduction differ in character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(4)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>establishes the nature of marriage</u>. The doctrine of the one
flesh defines marriage, which leads to multiplying and filling the earth
through the offspring of that union. The one flesh of marriage manifests in
humanity a plurality-in-oneness that is analogous to the plurality-in-oneness
in deity. Sexual unity between male-female is an intended physical analogy to
the person-to-person relationship between man and God and more especially
between the “us” of God. Arguing against temple prostitution, Paul says that
being sexually joined to a harlot makes the two one “body,” which he considers
incompatible with being analogously joined to the Lord as one “spirit” (1
Corinthians<b> 6</b>:16-17). Sexual union is intimate physical and
psychological identification even as spiritual union is interpersonal
identification. Husband-wife sexual relationship is ultimate intimacy in the
physical realm even as Father-Son-Spirit spiritual relationship is ultimate
intimacy in the interpersonal realm (note John <b>17</b>:20-22). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           God intended male-female physical unity to stay
within the interpersonal context rather than be separate. When it becomes something
by itself, it is reduced to temporary physical pleasure rather than
contributing to ongoing psychological identification. Intimacy is missing, and
the possibility of achieving it is often destroyed. Sexual relations were
intended to be a union in the larger context of commitment to values and
purposes (ethics) and to each other (identity). Intercourse is not for the one
or for the other partner, and so Paul teaches that neither husband nor wife has
final authority over his or her own body (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:2-5). Interpersonal
identity leads to physical intimacy, which establishes and reinforces
interpersonal intimacy. For this reason, the New Testament teaches that
fornication, adultery, and divorce are sinful: they destroy identity and the
sense of identity, and they are unique in the degree of doing so (1 Corinthians
<b>6</b>:18). Sexual relations have the guidelines they do because of God’s
purpose in establishing the marriage mode of intimacy as one reflection of the
divine image. That interpersonal purpose of God to have mankind in his own
image is reflected in the historical manner of his bringing man and woman into
existence (making one from the other and making one for one other) and in the
manner of having them reach their full number (procreation). It is reflected in
their complementariness (one flesh) and interdependency (man from the woman
plus man by the woman). All New Testament teaching on men-women relationships
stems from the nature of man and woman as implied by their manner of origin. That
is the reason New Testament teaching refers to Genesis <b>1-3</b> on every
issue associated with sexuality and men-women relationship in the home, the
church, and society. Those issues include fornication, adultery, divorce, and
complementary roles (Matthew <b>19</b>:3-12; Mark <b>10</b>:2-12; 1 Corinthians<b>
6</b>:12-20;<b> 11</b>:2-16; Ephesians <b>5</b>:22-33; 1 Timothy<b> 2</b>:11-15).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Of special importance regarding marriage is
the fact that its interpersonal character precedes its physical distinctive. Not
until there is compenetration of personhood can there naturally be
compenetration of physical natures; otherwise, there is loss of self-esteem. The
loss of self-esteem is both by the “user” and the “used.” The woman ends up
being the one most often “used” in fornication and adultery. The “used” loses
self-esteem because she senses in the other’s behavior a lack of “respect,”
which is another way of saying impersonal behavior. The “used” is not treated
as an equal but as something lower. The way others treat us is a prime basis
for the way we view ourselves. It is no wonder that “love ’em and leave ’em”
makes them feel like they are living a “dog’s life.” Even the “user” is not
fulfilled because he does not receive interpersonal response back from the
other, and “emptiness” results. Paul has such thoughts in mind when he says that
fornication is unique among sins in being a sin against the “body.” More than
any other it is a sin that strikes at the sense of who we are, our identity,
our “body” (1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:18). Marriage is mutual commitment and
common identity before it is pleasure and procreation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           We place the relevance of image to
male-female, not directly in the physical domain, but contextually in the
interpersonal framework where the physical body and human sexuality function. Physical
relationship occurs in interpersonal relationship, and physical relationship
bonds interpersonal identity uniquely between husband and wife. As a result,
analogy to the trinity teaches us about the divine intent in marriage as an
interpersonal experience, and the interpersonal intimacy of the marriage
experience helps us comprehend something about the divine trinity in whose
image men and women are created. In other words, the image of God in each
individual person manifests itself in ideal marriage as well as in ideal
society. The socio-physical unit we call marriage bears analogy to the
socio-spiritual unit we call trinity (cp. 1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:17). As such,
marriage participates in the less specialized interpersonalism that all persons
have capacity for: they can be one as Father and Son are one (John<b> 17</b>:22),
and they can be one with the Father and the Son in the same way the Father and
Son are one with each other (<b>17:</b>21).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The dignity of marriage nevertheless
harmonizes with the validity and wholeness of persons not married, because the
interpersonal capacity accentuated in marriage also finds expression in all
other personal relations. The interpersonal oneness of marriage simply adds the
dimension of physical intimacy (Genesis <b>2</b>:24; Ephesians <b>5</b>:23-33).
The total, permanent, exclusive identity of husband-wife reflects the
Father-Son-Spirit. In his own image God created them male and female.<b> </b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(5)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>clarifies the man-animal distinction</u>. Harmony describes the
image of God in connection with the God-man parallels. Contrast describes the
image in connection with the man-animal distinctives since no animal is said to
be created in God’s image. The man-animal distinction relates to other
observations. No mate for man was found in the animal kingdom (Genesis<b> 2</b>:18-20).
Animals could be killed but not man (Genesis <b>9</b>:6). Cohabitation between
man and animal was punishable by death under Mosaic legislation (Exodus <b>22</b>:19;
Leviticus <b>18</b>:23; <b>20</b>:15-16; Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:21). God gave
mankind dominion over the animal kingdom (Genesis <b>1</b>:26, 28; <b>2</b>:18-20).
Revelation does not classify mankind among animals, even though the two groups
share a significant set of characteristics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           If the image is the interpersonal capacity,
to be distinguished from animals, we do not have to be different in every
respect nor absolutely unique in any one respect. Rather, the <u>degree</u> to
which we possess these abilities is sufficiently greater that in combination
they produce our uniqueness as a total being—interpersonal capacity. Our
uniqueness from animals is not jeopardized by rudimentary intelligence seen in
tool making (<i>vs</i>. tool using) or in elementary language learning and
usage—which science has not demonstrated despite occasional claims to that
effect. The image is not <u>just</u> our distinctives from animals<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>any more than it is <u>only</u> the
commonalities between us and God.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>Rather,
our specific peculiarities usually reflect the image because they are
appropriate to, instead of necessary for, our purpose as summed up in
interpersonal existence. The image as interpersonal capacity establishes the
man-animal distinction at the level of the whole, not at the level of some
particular trait.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Interpersonal capacity can resist the
constant temptation toward reductionism and fragmentation. So much thinking
about the <i>imago dei</i>—and many other subjects as well—comes from
approaches that focus attention on specific distinctives rather than on
integrated wholes. Evolutionary philosophy offers one example. <u>Evolution</u>
arranges “kinds” in a sequence based on relative complexity amidst similarity
and then correlates this “logical sequence” with chronological sequence. The
next item up the evolutionary “tree” is contemplated relative to the one that
precedes it. It adds new features and subtracts or alters old ones. It is a
process of complexification through time. When theistic evolutionists plug us
into this schema and integrate their format with biblical considerations, the
image ends up being something added onto animal nature. The “add-on” is the
image, which roughly correlates with “higher nature” <i>vs</i>. “lower (animal)
nature.” That reductionist scenario works against wholeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Not only is the resulting view
reductionistic and fragmenting, it is also simplistic. Even the distinctions
between animals are more complex than that, much more the distinctions between us
and any one of them. The lack of adequate complexity comes from confusing
homologous with same and from not appreciating the complexity that comes from
the interdependency of parts within a functioning whole. <u>You cannot seriate
the origin or reciprocating parts</u>; that is, you cannot put in a time
sequence the beginning of parts that depend on each other reciprocally. The
whole has to be there from the beginning. Nascent and vestigial organs would be
dysfunctional within the previous whole and would tend away from the viability
of the organism rather than enhance its survival as evolution theory requires. The
only way to have a whole from the beginning is through creating the whole at
the beginning by external means. The result cannot come about by stages from
within. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           This critique of materialistic evolution
applies likewise to <u>reincarnation</u> and <u>chain of being</u>. The
complexity coefficient in these formats is too low to fit the actuality or
provide for the whole that we particularly are. In discussing the <i>imago dei</i>,
we want to avoid that same fault of making us too much like animals or
overdoing the differences between us and them. Interpersonal capacity seems to
meet this requirement by keeping physicality and sexuality within the image
while allowing for animals to have characteristics that are not individually of
sufficient degree to produce in the aggregate what we are calling interpersonal
capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(6)</b> The image of God as
interpersonal capacity <u>provides for a natural understanding of incarnation</u>.
It accounts for incarnation without <u>incarceration</u>. Though the Logos was
in a more limited condition during the time of incarnation, it was not an evil
condition inasmuch it was a self-limitation in humility and obedience to the
Father to accomplish a positive purpose. He expressed humility to the point of
death, violent death, yes, violent of an extreme sort (Philippians <b>2</b>:1-8).
Whatever evil there was lay in the behavior of those who rejected him and did
with him as they would. Incarnation does not require the discarding of deity or
imply the prostitution of humanness because we share the essential
characteristic.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Image of God as interpersonal capacity
accounts for incarnation without <u>dualism</u>. The doctrine of the “two
natures” does not come across as an artificial combination of divine and human
in Jesus. It does not represent a kind of “consubstantiation” or “impanation”
that mixes divine and human substances or amalgamates them into a third
substance that is neither truly human or verily divine. The “two natures” may
be regarded not so much as two different kinds as they are different levels of
the same kind: interpersonal being. At least the interpersonal capacity forms
the distinctive cluster of shared capacities between man and God. Incarnation
remains something of a mystery since we do not know very fully the nature of
deity that incarnated and do not know whether deity has any distinctive
hypostasis/substance. But we can say that (a) deity does <u>not become
something else</u> in becoming humanity, because the interpersonal image of God
that mankind has covers directly their creatable shared characteristics. (b)
Incarnation then <u>adds</u> compatible, human distinctives interpersonalized
by their <i>image dei</i> context. That addition does not bring in a set of
foreign characteristics; it simply defines a more limited arena in which the
common capacity operates or is temporarily suspended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Finally, (c) incarnation need <u>not lessen</u>
the degree of shared characteristics <u>or eradicate</u> the unshared ones. It
only requires voluntarily limiting the active expression of interpersonal
capacities or temporarily not using the unshared ones to the fullest. But
self-limitation is not loss. Consequently, we can understand “emptying” (<i>kenosis</i>)
in Philippians <b>2</b>:7 as voluntarily giving up the free exercise of divine <u>prerogatives</u>
rather than a giving up of <u>deity</u> <i>per se</i>. It was a matter of
Christ’s humbling himself and being obedient (<b>2</b>:8).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(7)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>connects the natural and the ethical usages of the expression “image
of God</u>.” One characteristic of biblical content is its concern for
wholeness, the big picture, the synthetic emphasis in contrast to a
dichotomistic, analytical, reductionist emphasis. That concern carries over
into the usage of words. The penchant for integration accounts for the rather
facile <u>shifting back and forth</u> between natural, behavioral, and
relational usages of words like image, life, sin, flesh, create, knowledge,
wisdom, and other terms associated with the creation narrative. It accounts for
places where such expressions may <u>combine</u> these rather different
concepts when the presentation deals with subjects in broad scope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           “Image” in the sense of nature appears in
Genesis <b>1</b>:26; <b>5</b>:1; <b>9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7; and
James <b>3</b>:9. Paul uses “image” in an ethical sense in Romans <b>8</b>:29;
2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:18; Colossians <b>3</b>:10. Not only were we created in
the image of God as to <u>nature</u>; we are commanded to be like him as to <u>behavior</u>.
Ethics and morality apply only to interpersonal circumstances. The natural
image amounts to the interpersonal capacity; the ethical image amounts to
proper interpersonal behavior via the natural. The extended use of <i>image</i>
for ethical character confirms our understanding of image as interpersonal
capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(8)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>sets the framework for ethical theory</u>. How something “ought” to
operate derives from its nature relative to its purpose. The primary ethical
guideline derived from interpersonalism is that behavior should conform to what
fits personhood. Manipulation and force by one person against another fail to
allow the “other” to be what a “self” is. Ethics is no longer accomplished by
people individually conforming their behavior to a standard of behavior. It
calls for a righteousness that <i>“exceeds the righteousness of scribes and
Pharisees”</i> (Matthew <b>5</b>:20). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(9)</b> Finally, the image as
interpersonal capacity <u>makes a natural connection with Christ as the ethical
image and likeness of God for us</u>. Whereas the natural image is retained
when people fall, the ethical image is lost by sin and restored through grace
in Christ, who is the image of God (2 Corinthians <b>4</b>:4; cp. Colossians <b>1</b>:15).
Paul especially sprinkles creation terminology through his presentations on
salvation and sanctification: creation, image, likeness, knowledge, wisdom. Because
none of us have behaved completely in keeping with the way God expresses his
interpersonal capacity, Christ came to redeem us from being sinners in order to
<i>“put on the new man that is being renewed to ‘knowledge’ after the ‘<u>image</u>’
of the creator”</i> (Colossians <b>3</b>:10). Paul says that we are <i>“created
in Christ Jesus for good works”</i> (Ephesians <b>2</b>:10). From Jews and
Gentiles Christ <i>“created in himself”</i> a new united mankind (<b>2</b>:15).
We are to <i>“put on the new man that has been created according to God [=
likeness?] in righteousness and holiness of the truth” </i>(<b>4</b>:24; cp.
Colossians <b>2</b>:10).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(1)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>establishes objective human worth</u>. There are three related
bases for human value. As to <u>being</u>, humans are significant because they
are created in the image of God. As to <u>relationship</u>, they are
significant because they can relate the kind of God their creator is. As to <u>purpose</u>,
they are meaningful because they have objective purposes God established for
them—responsibility for the creation and proclamation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           <b>(2)</b> The image as interpersonal
capacity <u>establishes objective bases for a human sense of worth</u>. Humans’
self-image has very much to do with the quality of their life and sense of
fulfillment in it. Self-image has very much to do with the way they carry themselves
in relationship to each other. Being created in God’s image is the fundamental
reality that underlies objective and subjective human worth, as well as a whole
host of other things that relate to their nature in relationship to other

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Since God created us in his own image,
identifying the image consists of comparing the biblical teaching about God and
about us and integrating it with confirmatory evidence from human experience. Purpose
determines nature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           As to the meaning of the <u>image terms</u>,
we have differentiated between natural and ethical usages within the scripture,
ethical usages appearing only in the New Testament. Within the natural usage,
we have identified the image of God with the interpersonal capacity and
distinguished the <u>image itself</u> from manifestations, modes, and aspects
of it. The capacity for interpersonal operation leads to the manifestations,
uses, consequences, and extensions of it in fellowship with God, in
responsibilities like dominion and mission, in marriage especially, and in
society generally. Male and female are <u>modes of the image</u>. Reason, will,
affection, conscience, spirit, and the like are <u>aspects of the image</u>,
that is, simple individual capacities that combine to produce the complex
interpersonal capacity with its modes and manifestations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           The natural image consists of the (a) <u>creatable</u>,
(b) <u>shared</u> characteristics between God and mankind. It does not directly
include every characteristic of people or God, nor does it include them in the
same degree. It is not limited to the peculiarities of humankind over animals. The
image does not have to be grounded in the same thing that it is for God or
angels; hence, it can indirectly include even the physical body, human
sexuality, and marriage by involving them as the ground of the image, the
medium for expressing it, or the means of transferring it across generations.           </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>           Identifying the image of God with the
interpersonal capacity has several advantages because the concept is so basic
and yet so comprehensive and complex. Because of the inherent complexity of
persons in relationship, interpersonal capacity can incorporate anything
scripturally relevant to the <i>imago dei</i> and everything scholars have
historically associated with it. It fosters holism and avoids reductionism,
establishes a theology of sexuality, affirms the completeness of single persons
of either sex without projecting sexuality onto deity, legitimizes diversity
and its potentialities. Interpersonal capacity can account for an extensive and
diverse range of items without making people too much like God or <i>vice versa</i>,
which confirms the correctness of identifying the image with the interpersonal
capacity.</span></p>
