Depravity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             In the late fourth century
Augustine, bishop of Hippo in North Africa, gave classical expression to natural
depravity as part of his understanding of the nature of evil. In his thought,
evil is a <u>lack</u> (privation) in the <u>form of substance</u> relative to
its <u>original form</u>. That relatively deformed condition produces evil
action. The <u>nature of evil</u> is lack, the <u>cause of evil</u> is lack in
form, and the <u>criterion of evil</u> is lack in form compared to pristine
form</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Applying the idea to human
nature meant that our sinful actions are caused by a loss of order in
comparison to the way God originally made us. This loss of form occurred at the
Fall of Adam. His first sinful act brought upon him a fallen nature that all
his descendants inherit biologically. By birth each of us receives the “sinful
nature” that cannot act righteously as it originally could. We all become
sinners personally because of the inherited fallen nature we did not choose to
have. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Historically</u>, the
doctrine of natural depravity has held sway in the thinking of practically
every strain of Christianity. Augustine’s influence on the church down through
the Middle Ages is well known. The leaders of the Reformation had basically the
same view of humankind. In modern evangelicalism the same view prevails. The
concept of natural depravity has permeated the length and breadth of Christian thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Systematically</u>,
natural depravity connects with several topics in Christian theology. This
inability to respond to spiritual influences forms a basic element in belief
about (a) <u>the nature of humankind</u> itself (anthropology). We are not
capable of obeying God and having fellowship with him. <b>(b) </b>Natural depravity
affects<b> </b><u>the work of the Spirit</u> because he must supernaturally
regenerate the fallen nature before conversion can take place and spiritual
growth can begin (pneumatology). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Inability to respond to God
qualifies <b>(c)</b> the <u>role of Christian evidence</u> (apologetics). Giving
reasons for believe Christianity and trust in Christ has no value if we cannot
appreciate them. The function of Christian evidence is not to lead us to accept
Christ; in its most extreme form, it only confirms us afterward in the previous
choice supernaturally accomplished irresistibly by God himself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The doctrine of natural
depravity impacts how we conceptualize <b>(d)</b> <u>the process of salvation</u>
(soteriology). First, it explains why we all sin: we have all descended from
the same first parents, who had the fallen nature. Secondly, it explains why we
cannot save ourselves: we do not have the ability to respond to God and to save
ourselves by those responses.                </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(e)</b> Depravity affects
<u>biblical interpretation</u> in a couple ways. It causes us to take biblical
statements about humankind differently than otherwise. It also predicts that as
unregenerate we cannot understand the Bible and come to a saving knowledge of
Christ by hearing the message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, <b>(f)</b> <u>sanctification</u>
may include a <i>“second definite work of grace”</i> by the Spirit on our
nature to <i>“remove the last vestiges of inbred sin.” </i>Regeneration is hypostatically
a supernatural work of the Spirit that raises our capacity to where we can fully
respond to the gospel—whether resistibly or not. Before the Wesleyan movement
in England that regeneration was not something that could lead to a wholly
sinless life of love. “Entire sanctification” plus regeneration fully restores us
to the moral ability Adam had before the fall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Hermeneutically</u>
within scripture, we need a principle by which to get behind the impasse posed
by certain pairs of passages that deal with the relationship between human and
divine action. Lacking such a principle has caused the deadlock between
thinkers throughout the history of interpretation on many texts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For example, Psalm <b>51</b>:10
says, <i>“Create a clean heart in me, God; and renew a right spirit in me.”</i>
Ezekiel, however, says in <b>18</b>:31, <i>“Make for yourselves a new heart and
a new spirit.” </i>The problem comes in deciding which statement provides the
logically prior framework by which to understand the other. Similar questions
arise between other pairs of contrasting passages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpreters agree that
there are ways of understanding either passage as guided by the other, but
where to start? They need some principle for that determination. If scripture
shows that we can respond to God, the interpreter can decide how to manage the interpretation
of the passages in question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Beyond scripture, Christians
seek some frame of reference for critiquing hypotheses advanced by the
scientific community in anthropology, psychology, and sociology. A positive
conclusion about human ability gives them a perspective for evaluating what
will and will not fit with their faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The doctrine of natural
depravity is questionable on two bases. <b>First</b>, scripture does not say
that human nature differed in spiritual ability after the Fall from what it was
before the Fall in a biologically inheritable sense. We do not need natural
depravity to explain why sin happens; Adam sinned before he fell. Individual
texts do speak about the sinfulness of unsaved people and their frequent
resistance to repentance in response to the good news. That is quite different
from saying that it takes a <u>supernatural</u> operation on their very nature to
remove the resistance. Without going into detail here, we simply affirm that no
clear <u>positive evidence</u> exists for natural depravity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Second</b>, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>there is</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>negative evidence</u>. Scripture says that God
does not want anyone to perish (2 Peter <b>3</b>:9). Elsewhere, it says that
some will perish (Matthew <b>25</b>:46). Furthermore, God is self-consistent: <i>“God
is not a mortal that he should lie”</i> or repent (Numbers<b> 23</b>:19). The
variable that explains the difference between the “all” God desires to save and
the “some” he decides to save must lie outside himself or he would be
inconsistent. That variable must lie in us, the only other actors. If we have
no ability to respond to God, God becomes the chooser of who is saved by virtue
of whom he enables to respond unto salvation. We do not have a depraved nature,
not only because </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>scripture
provides</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> no positive basis for it, but
because natural depravity makes God inconsistent in desiring to save all while deciding
to enable only some. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The principle that gets
behind the impasse is psychological depravity. It results from ignorance,
pervertible desires, and evil influence. We all go through the process our
first parents experienced and deal with the same kinds of consequences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Extremes often beget
extremes, so we must not overreact by viewing human spiritual ability too
highly. In place of a natural depravity that takes a <u>supernatural miracle</u>
to correct, we can speak of psychological depravity that <u>interpersonal
influence</u> can correct. We do experience the drag of past failure on present
resolve. We more than sympathize with Paul in not being able to succeed morally
as he wanted (Romans <b>7</b>:13-25). Our frustration at recurring moral failure
is real and appropriate. But Paul’s experience shows that the <u>kind</u> of
frustration we experience is true after salvation as well as before even though
the <u>degree</u> may not be the same. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Hopefully, frustration over
moral failure will decline as we grow in Christian virtue. We must assist that
growth by putting ourselves in contact with the influence of other people in
fellowship and service and by putting ourselves in contact with the influence
of God through “spiritual exercises” like prayer, Bible reading, and fasting. The
influence of persons provides us with the psychological strength to respond to
God and to make progress at overcoming psychological depravity.</span></p>
