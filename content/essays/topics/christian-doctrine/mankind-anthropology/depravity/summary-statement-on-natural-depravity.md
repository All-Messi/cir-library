<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The proposition counter to natural
depravity is as follows: there is no (1) <u>clear</u> (2) <u>biblical</u> basis
for saying that Adam’s ability regarding (3) <u>spiritual</u> things after the
fall was different from what it was (4) <u>before the fall</u> in a (5) <u>biologically</u>
inheritable sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            By “clear” biblical base we mean that
there are passages that we could interpret the way natural depravity takes
them. But, no passage requires such an understanding. Many texts offered in
support of that concept cannot have that meaning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            By “biblical” base we mean that there are
experiential observations that we could put in the service of a view like
natural depravity. Skinnerian psychology proposes something similar even though
in our estimation the experimental evidence for it is no closer to proof than any
biblical evidence for it. But Christian theologians are concerned primarily
with biblical rather than <u>scientific</u> evidence. More particularly, “biblical”
evidence contrasts with <u>philosophical</u> thought. Natural depravity is an
understandable concept that has relatively strong explanatory power, and it can
be put in relatively self-consistent terms (minus, of course, the strictures
noted above in at least the Calvinistic formulation of it). But the theological
task is not a creative one so much as an interpretative one. Christian teaching
needs to arise from scripture (theology), not from creative imagination
(philosophy).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ability in “spiritual” things
distinguishes the issue at hand from losses that scripture indicates our first
parents incurred when they disobeyed. Nothing in Genesis or elsewhere indicates
that the original sin reduced our innate ability to operate interpersonally
with God or other people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             “Before the fall” draws attention to the
way people were after they first sinned <i>vs.</i> the way they were before. We
can imagine having more power to resist temptation and obey God. But the proper
comparison is not between the way we are and some imaginable possibility, but
between the way they were before and after the fateful disobedience. When people
first sinned, they did not have a “fallen” nature; so having a fallen nature is
not necessary for explaining why people sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Biologically” inheritable specifies that
whatever defect a person could have must be transmitted genetically for it to require
supernatural remedying by the Spirit. Behavioral depravity can be socially
transmitted as well as originated repeatedly in each of us through ignorance
plus the pull of neutral bodily drives we can fulfill in negative ways. The
failure to live above our individual viewpoints and to override bodily drives
by rational values stems from the fact that it is easier not to live transcendently.
It is easier to act on our own present material interests than to curb
self-gratification by considering the welfare of others, future consequences,
and transcendent values. After sin has originated in us individually, the
neutral ability of habit formation explains how it persists in us. Psychological
depravity—the power of sin to hold us down, the bondage of the will—results
from previous sin. It is the pull of past sin on present resolve, ingrained
habit rather than inborn defect. Psychological depravity comes from “self-depravitization”
rather than hereditary corruption. The natural-depravity proposal represents
overkill for explaining universal, all-pervasive sin in us.</span></p>
