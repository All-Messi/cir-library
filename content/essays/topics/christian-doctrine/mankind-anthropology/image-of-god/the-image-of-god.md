<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Much of my creative
energies lately have been directed toward tracing through the implications of
interpersonal relationship as the organizing reality for Christian truth. Nowhere
has this observation appeared more relevant than in the study of the nature of
mankind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Over the centuries extensive
thought has gone into the interpretation of Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27 and related
materials: <i>“Let’s make mankind in our image after our likeness.” </i>There
have been four proposed aspects of the “image of God” together with their
effects. <u>Reason</u> heads the list. The ability to think abstractly relates
to the capacity for language communication, creativity, responsibility
(dominion), conscience, even humor, self-transcendence, and the ability to
project consciousness over behind the eyes of another person. People can
penetrate a situation in thought and imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Emotion</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> distinguishes us from much of the created realm
because we can care, have feelings, experience affection from other persons. Our
<u>will</u> enables us to choose between alternatives. Consequently, we are not
limited to a stimulus-response existence where response answers the most
intense stimulus in the environment. We have a <u>spirit</u>, an aspect that
continues after the death of the body. Traditionally we have been regarded as
in God’s image because we have rational, emotional, volitional, and spiritual
capacities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>While these proposals
offer valuable insights into our nature, Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27 suggests a
larger, more inclusive truth that correlates with interpersonalism. <b>The
first factor</b> is the plural pronoun <u>us</u>. <i>“Let <u>us</u> make mankind
in our image”</i> draws attention to the interpersonal character of God
himself. In our understanding of the text, <b>(1) </b>“us” refers to the
three-person oneness of God. <b>(2)</b> It is not majestic plural, we take it,
since <b>3</b>:22 soon speaks about “<u>one of</u> us.” “Majestic plural” is a
Semitic idiom that using plurality to indicate size—in this case the greatness
of God. But there could be no speaking about “one of” such a plurality: <i>“Adam
has become like one of us.”</i> An alternate approach supposes that <b>(3)</b> “us”
means God and the angels. But angels have not appeared in the context so as to
be antecedents of the pronoun. “Angel” does not appear until Genesis <b>16</b>:7.
“Cherub” does appear in <b>3</b>:24 in reference either to an order of angels
or a figure for the angelic order. Nevertheless, even this term occurs a full
two chapters past the “image of God” usage. Furthermore, <b>(4)</b> the text
says we are created in the image and likeness of <u>God</u>, not only here but
elsewhere (Genesis <b>5</b>:1—likeness; <b>9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians<b> 11</b>:7;
James <b>3</b>:9; cp. Acts <b>17</b>:28-29). Such phraseology does not occur
for likeness to angels anywhere. It seems only natural to take “us” as
indicative of God’s interpersonal. Since we bear the image of that
interpersonal God, the image of God in us refers primarily to our interpersonal
nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A second factor</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> that highlights the interpersonal character of mankind
comes from the parallelism in Genesis<b> 1</b>:27<i>. “In the image of God he
created mankind”</i> stands parallel to <i>“male and female he created them.” </i>The
image relates in some way to the male-female nature of humanness. Since God is
spirit, physical sexuality is not the point even though marriage does provide
the most intense, permanent, and all-inclusive interpersonal relationship in
human experience. Marriage has the character that it does primarily because in
it we most distinctively demonstrate the intense, permanent, and all-inclusive
oneness of the godhead. We can say that the plurality-in-oneness of marriage is
<u>analogous</u> to the plurality-in-oneness of trinity even though it does not
refer to the <u>same</u> thing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Of special importance
regarding marriage is that its interpersonal character precedes its physical distinctiveness.
Not until there is compenetration of personhood can there properly be
compenetration of physical natures. Marriage is mutual commitment and common
identity of persons before it is pleasure and procreation. (We are unique in
being able to reproduce face to face.) Consequently, we place the relevance of
image to male-female, not directly in the physical domain, but contextually in
its interpersonal framework in which the body and human sexuality are parts. Physical
relationship occurs in interpersonal relationship, and physical relationship
bonds interpersonal identity uniquely between husband and wife. As a result,
analogy to the trinity teaches us about the divine intent in marriage as an
interpersonal experience, and the interpersonal marriage experience helps us
comprehend something about the divine trinity in whose image we are created. In
other words, the image of God in us lies at the corporate and the individual
level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The individual capacities traditionally cited do have
a place in the image, not because they are the image, but because they make it
possible. Reason, emotion, will, <i>etc</i>., are abilities necessary for operating
interpersonally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We see several
advantages to putting the image at the level of interpersonal capacity. For one
thing, it <b>(1)</b> fosters wholeness. The image does not reduce us to one
essence like rationality, nor does it fragment us into a series of parts like
reason, will, <i>etc</i>. Our wholeness in God’s image can involve even the
physical body so as not to create unnatural division between body and spirit or
depreciate the physical aspect of the total self. The image can include the
body by analogy. The socio-physical unit that marriage is bears analogy to the
socio-spiritual unit that Father-Son-Spirit is (note implications of 1
Corinthians <b>6</b>:17).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The image as
interpersonal capacity <b>(2)</b> clarifies the man-animal distinction. No
animal is said to be created in God’s image. No mate for the man existed in the
animal kingdom (Genesis <b>2</b>:18-20). Animals could be killed but not man
(Genesis <b>9</b>:6). Cohabitation between man and animal was punishable by
death (Leviticus<b> 20</b>:15). To be distinguished from animals, we do not
have to be unique in any or every respect. Rather, the <u>degree</u> to which we
possess these abilities is sufficiently greater that in combination they
produce our uniqueness—the interpersonal capacity. Our uniqueness from animals
is not jeopardized by rudimentary intelligence seen in crude tool making (<i>vs</i>.
tool using) or perhaps in elementary language learning—which has not actually
been demonstrated despite claims to that effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The image as
interpersonal capacity <b>(3)</b> provides a theological foundation for
interpreting sexuality. It affirms the equal worth of both sexes (Galatians <b>3</b>:28)
and defines the proper relationship between them (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:13-20).
That variance participates in the larger truth of the divine image common to
both and expressed in the union of the two (Genesis <b>2</b>:24). The dignity
of marriage nevertheless harmonizes with the validity and wholeness of
personhood in those not married, because the interpersonal capacity accentuated
in marriage also finds expression in all other social relations. The total,
permanent, exclusive identity of husband and wife is analogous to the
Father-Son-Spirit. In his own image, God created us male and female.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Finally, the <i><u>imago
dei</u></i> as interpersonal capacity <b>(4)</b> connects the natural and
ethical usages of the <i>“image of God”</i> expression (Genesis <b>1</b>:26; <b>5</b>:1;
<b>9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians<b> 11</b>:7; James<b> 3</b>:9 <i>vs</i>. Romans <b>8</b>:29;
2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:18; Colossians <b>3</b>:10). Not only were we created in
the image of God; we are redeemed from being sinners in order to <i>“put on the
new humanity that is being renewed to knowledge after the <u>image</u>” </i>of our
creator (Colossians <b>3</b>:10). Ethics and morality apply only to
interpersonal circumstances. The natural image amounts to the interpersonal
capacity; the ethical image amounts to proper use of it. The use of <i>image</i>
to mean ethical character confirms our understanding of the creatable image as
the interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Image,” then, is used
in a <u>nature</u> sense (Genesis<b> 1</b>:26-27;<b> 9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7;<b>
15</b>:49; James <b>3</b>:9), in an <u>ethical</u> sense (Romans <b>8</b>:29; 2
Corinthians <b>3</b>:18; Colossians <b>3</b>:10; 2 Peter <b>1</b>:4), and
perhaps in an <u>eschatological</u> sense (Romans<b> 8</b>:29?).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:31.5pt;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In summation, when Genesis <b>1</b>:26
speaks of the image of God, it does so in connection with (a) mankind, not with
some aspect of mankind, with (b) both male and female, and with (c) humans
individually and in combination.</span></p>
