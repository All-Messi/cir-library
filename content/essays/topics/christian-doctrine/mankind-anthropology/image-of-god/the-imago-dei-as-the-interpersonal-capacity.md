study proposes that the image of God in us is the interpersonal capacity. It
does not necessarily say something new, but endeavors to assemble relevant
factors, to clarify a viewpoint that best incorporates them, and to show its
consonance with the Christian worldview. In method, the approach sets aside a
reductionism that strives after identifying our “essence” and “risks”
reification, faculty psychology, depersonalization, and individualism, which
are tendencies that derive from non-revelatory origins. It opts instead for a
combinationalism that accounts for all the features of nature, function, and
relationship that’s special revelation pictures us as having and called to
have. </span></p>

Genesis <b>5</b>:1-22; <b>9</b>:6 and James<b> 3</b>:9.</span><b><sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I. Fundamental Factors</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image must be <u>creatable</u>; so it deals with being (ontology) <i>per se</i>,
rather than with action or relationship. Being, action, and relationship belong
to any reality. The first constitutes what God made in us, because only it is
creatable; the others derive on the creatable base. The image precedes any
expression of it, so it has to do with capacity rather than consequence of
capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image is something <u>shared with God</u>; so it refers to characteristics scripture
associates with both God and us, though not necessarily all characteristics or
in the same degree as he has them; and may or may not exclude those not present
in deity (<i>“flesh and bones”</i>; Luke <b>24</b>:39 + John <b>4</b>:24) or in
us (eternality, aseity).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image makes us <u>distinct from the rest of creation</u>; at least scriptures
does not speak of anything else this way in this realm—whatever may be the case
with the heavenly orders of being.. The image refers to our distinctives as
over against non-living matter, plants, and animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image involves <u>both singular and plural</u>: <i>“Let <u>us</u> make man in <u>our</u>
image”</i> (Genesis <b>1</b>:26); <i>“It is not good that the man should be
alone” </i>(Genesis <b>2</b>:18). “Us” is not majestic plural since later <i>“the
man has become <u>one of</u> us”</i> (Genesis <b>3</b>:22). “Us” does not refer
to angels, who are not in the context and do not come into reference till at
least <b>3</b>:24; cp.<b> 16</b>:7. Furthermore, scripture gives no indication
that angels can create from nothing. It says everywhere that <u>God</u> created
us in his own image.</span><b><sup><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:
115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>2</span></sup></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> It
is a plurality of individuals and a social singularity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image must be <u>common to all of us irrespective of variations in kind and
degree among us</u>. Genesis presents the origin of mankind itself and does so
as descending from the first pair, who were to multiply and fill the earth.
Elsewhere Paul says that <i>“God made of one every nation of people to live on
all over the earth”</i> (Acts <b>17</b>:26, monophylogeny). Consequently, the
image exists irrespective of differences within the human category: sex, social
or marital status, race, or other groupings of individuals (cp. Galatians <b>3</b>:28).
The redemptive principle applies equally to all people in those regards; so the
alienation that reconciliation saves us from is not a re-creation of being by
supernatural impersonal cause, but by restoration of relationship by natural
interpersonal influence (cp. Matthew<b> 28</b>:18-20; Ephesians<b> 2</b>:11-22).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image is not “<u>losable</u>,” hence, something not originated by use or
destroyed by misuse. We have the image even when not using it, that is, even aside
from interpersonal activity and its consequences, and aside from any
distinction within those who have it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image (being) must be <u>capable of fulfilling divine directives</u> regarding responsibility
and morality (action and relationship). So divine-human image and likeness
requires aspects that singly or conjointly make responsibility and morality possible.
That generalization introduces items in the next section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

Fitting Connections</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
preceding observations fit with and enable several notable features of
humankind, especially in contrast to other orders of being within this
creation. Paramount among these features are capacities associated with <u>personhood
and concomitant interpersonal relationships</u>. God and humankind share the
image, and all individual humans share it as well; so interpersonal
relationship is active and can exist both horizontally with other people and
vertically with God. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            From
the beginning God gave mankind <u>responsibility</u> for at least the part of
creation where he placed Adam (Genesis <b>1</b>:26, 28; cp. Psalm <b>8 </b>&lt;
Hebrews <b>2</b>:5-18). <a name="_Hlk193229673">Doing that calls for aspects of
the creatable whole like reason and will. With image and likeness the Genesis
text immediately connects caring for the plant and animal kingdoms. Genesis<b>
2</b> particularizes that role to tending the Garden, a role more generally
expressed regarding the whole world (Genesis <b>9</b>:1-2) and later the
natural order in general (Psalm <b>8</b> and Hebrews <b>2</b>). </a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
scripture as confirmed by experience, the capacities associated with both God
and us alone (in this creation) make possible the <u>moral capacity</u>, moral
operation being what most prominently God calls us to, and what applies to
interpersonal behavior. Shared characteristics between him and us include those
abilities that are directly interpersonal and operate in the interpersonal
circumstance. That observation implies creatable factors that make those behaviors
possible. Morality applies only to personal interaction. Among composite social
abilities, <u>love</u> stands pre-eminently in both and expresses itself in <u>grace</u>
from one side of relationships and <u>faith</u>/trust from the other. In its
biblical use, love combines rationality, knowing, affection, volition, and
behavior, and serves as the source and context for virtues biblical writers enumerate
(cp. 1 Corinthians <b>13</b>; Galatians <b>5</b>:22-23; and elsewhere).</span><b><sup><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>3</span></sup></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> Beyond
reason and will, the moral social dimension brings in <u>conscience</u>, which
measures behavior against values, as well as <u>hope</u> in one person
responding to promise by another. The interpersonal capacity includes the
ability to project consciousness over behind the eyes of another person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Identifying
the image as the interpersonal capacity maintains the biblical <u>man-animal
distinction</u>. It fits with animal abilities often superior individually to
mankind’s in non-interpersonal matters—the senses, strength, size. It
harmonizes as well with those individual capacities in “higher animals” that
are lesser in degree more than other in kind—tool making more than tool using,
for example. Interpersonal capacities and their derivatives exist in a degree
and in the aggregate to form a kind not present in the animal kingdom
sufficiently for crossing the threshold into “interpersonhood” and
interpersonal behavior. Rudimentary “intelligence” and creativity are not of
sufficient level to contribute to the interpersonal human endowment.
Communication, group relations, and the like are based in, and enabled by,
different mechanisms: biology-based instinct and chemical-based “drives.” Human
behavior is much more learned (from influence and experience) than innate
(transmitted biologically).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            From
the standpoint of <u>terminology</u>, that understanding of the creatable image
paves the way for using “create” and “image” in an ethical sense in the New
Testament (Romans <b>8</b>:29; Ephesians <b>2</b>:10 [3]; Colossians <b>3</b>:10)
), “dead” being an image for insensitivity to (influence) and separation from
(“dead to me”). The image, created by divine authority or power through Christ in
the beginning (John <b>1</b>:3, 10), is analogous to divine initiative in
bringing about the ethical image by influence through Christ in the gospel.</span><b><sup><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>4</span></sup></b><span

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Relative
sovereignty</u> under God is preserved in this view of the image; because in
being like God as to kind, we are not like God as to degree in authority,
power, reason, or knowledge, and their derivatives. Thus are preserved both our
dignity and humility (proper station) conjointly—<u>dignity</u> by doing like
God and <u>humility</u> by doing under him, being less than him, and being led
by him. So, there can be healthy self-esteem without pride because of being in
God’s image, fellowshiping with him, and receiving back love first shown to
others, after having received it first from him (1 John <b>4</b>:19). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
image as the interpersonal capacity finds significant verification in the
essence of the Christian message: the <u>eternal redemptive programmatic</u>
understood as reconciliation from alienation caused by personal sin as behavior
(2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:18-19; Ephesians<b> 2</b>:11-22).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
interpersonal capacity shared by God and us provides the crossover area between
natural and supernatural; the two realms are not absolutely different. The
divine is not wholly other from the human despite God’s not having the
limitations in kind and degree that he built into the human order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
<i>imago dei</i> becomes the <u>avenue for incarnation</u> without perversion
or loss for deity or humanity. The <i>kenosis</i> (Philippians<b> 2</b>:7) can
then be understood as an “emptying” of the free <u>exercise</u> of rights,
privileges, and capacities of deity rather than a loss of deity <i>per se</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
creatable image in the material realm preserves the <u>goodness of matter</u>,
including the body and its drives and needs. It likewise establishes the
spirit-matter relationship by putting the spiritual above the material to curb
its use as the instrument of expression and accomplishment. Spirit is not
opposed to matter (gnostic dualism) or superior to matter (Platonism), but
different from matter. Spirit and matter serve different purposes, and good and
bad are always measured relative to purpose. The spiritual capacities—however
God has related them to the creatable aspect of humanity (mind-brain, <i>e.g</i>.)—enable
transcendence over time, space, and self; and allow for self-awareness, the
projection of consciousness to another person’s viewpoint (Golden Rule),
penetrating a future or distant situation by thought, undergird creativity in
thought and expression, and issue in abstract thought, language communication, humor,
intentionality and motive, sense of fulfillment, self-image, attitude,
affection, and so on.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            This
understanding of image preserves <u>relative sovereignty</u> under God, because
in being like God as to kind, we are not like God as to degree in authority,

both our dignity and humility conjointly—<u>dignity</u> by being like him and <u>humility</u>
by being under him. So there can be healthy self-esteem without pride because
of being in God’s image, fellowshiping with him, and receiving love back from
love first shown. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Finally,
the <i>imago dei</i> as the interpersonal capacity, participates appropriately
in interpersonalism as <u>the Christian worldview.</u> That worldview derives
from considering what is most original (trinity), what is most ultimate, what
is most eternal (love), what is most comprehensive, what constitutes the greatest
commandments, what characterizes the prominent Christian vocabulary, and so on.</span></p>

1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7 Paul’s concern is apparently with man-women ordering
(responsibility levels reinforced by authority granted). If he meant creatable
image, he would put himself at odds with Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27; that text
affirms the image for both man and woman individually and conjointly. On the
basis of the God-Christ-man-woman authority flow in <b>11</b>:3, the inference
is that Paul is not talking about “creatable image” (ontic being), but “decreed
image” about man-woman relative rank (appropriate relationship) and consequent
behavioral demeanor and decorum in church. His basis for doing so evidently
stems from the direct manner of Adam’s creation by God and the subsequent
indirect manner of Eve’s creation from Adam. The presentation parallels Paul’s
comments in 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:11-15, where he appeals to the sequence of their
creation and their fall as at least illustrative of proper man-woman
complementariness.</span></p>

Positive determinism eliminates both mission (responsibility) and the moral
matrix (morality). There is restrictive determinism (from maximum down) via <u>weakness</u>
in distinction from positive determinism from zero up via <u>necessity</u>. To
put it differently, freedom takes place within determinism. It is freedom
within a framework; hence, it is not absolute for us (or God, for that matter).
Personal freedom overrides environmental temptation and coercion by choosing to

tweak to the image as the interpersonal capacity would be integrating into this

“potential,” or latent interpersonalism for (1) those at conception to
incipient socialization, even psychological interpersonalism (regarded as human
by others) for (2) severely handicapped, vegetative, non-verbal,
immobile/non-ambulatory individuals. The same “sub-interpersonal” issue arises
with (3) dementia patients and comatose persons. We <u>regard them</u> as human
because of what they have been (#3), what they will become (#2), or on the
basis of origin (#1), even though they cannot function as humans
characteristically function.</span></p>
