<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Given <u>his nature</u>, God decided
on certain <u>purposes</u>. In light of those purposes, he made the <u>creation</u>,
including humankind. So God made the <u>nature of man</u> the way he did
because of the purposes he had for us in his creation and beyond. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 God made mankind simply because he
delighted in doing so. Aside from any further considerations, persons
experience fulfillment in being creative. The same holds for our personal God. Because
of sheer delight, God expressed himself creatively and <i>“saw that it was good.”</i>
That recurring statement in Genesis <b>1</b> expresses his sense of satisfaction
in doing so (Genesis <b>1</b>:31; cp. <b>1</b>:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25). In that
respect, God created us for something of the same reason he made the rest of
creation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>What in the structure of Genesis 1
shows how much God delighted in making humankind?</b> Genesis puts mankind <u>last</u>
as the apex of God’s creativity in nature and gives humans the most space in
the account of origins. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>What is there about the way
Genesis 2 is put together that says something about the value of mankind in his
creator’s eyes? </b>He stands in the <u>center</u> of the account; Genesis
organizes other things God created around the record of mankind’s origin.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>What indicators stress the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 God made mankind as someone to shower
his grace on. Beyond creating everything <u>to delight in</u>, God created us
as someone <u>to delight in</u>—to show his goodness to, to give fellowship to,
and give purpose to. Even though poets find fulfillment in writing poetry, they
do not write it simply for themselves. Likewise, the heavens declare God’s
glory to <u>us</u> (Psalm <b>19</b>:1). He created us to share his presence
with (note Genesis<b> 3</b>:8). His making us is comparable to Christ’s calling
the twelve <i>“that they might <u>be with him,</u> and he <u>might send them</u>
to preach”</i> (Mark<b> 3</b>:14). For us there is delight in simply <i>experiencing
existence</i> in fellowship and in <i>sensing purpose</i>. Making us in a way
that we can be blessed in these ways, God provides additional outlets for his
tendency as a person to show grace. We all experience this “common grace” of
creation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                     <b>In what ways does God’s desire
to create mankind compare with a couple’s desire to have children?</b> They
have someone to love, someone that relates to them in a special way, someone
that “looks like them” and shares identity with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>Is there any sense in which God’s
creating mankind ends up putting some limitations on himself? </b>In order to
be self-consistent, God must now make his decisions in light of the personal
beings he has brought into existence to share reality with. Couples have
children despite knowing that certain limitations will come to own movements.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>If there are such “limitations,”
what does his creating us anyway say about him, about his attitude toward us,
and about us?</b> He is not a self-centered God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                     <b>How does creating us as “caretakers
of creation” (Genesis 1:26, 28) show us grace? Look at Psalm 8, for example.</b>
Giving us responsibility gives us dignity and honor, which helps give us a
sense of worth, which in turn helps make life good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section III: God’s Glory</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Creating mankind for <i>fellowship</i>
and <i>stewardship</i> results in God’s glory because we thank and praise him
for those previous graces. Paul makes a threefold statement of that pattern in
Ephesians <b>1</b>:3-14 when he says that God <i>“foreordained us to adoption
as sons through Jesus Christ to himself according to the <u>good pleasure</u>
of his <u>will</u>, to the <u>praise</u> of the <u>glory</u> of his <u>grace</u>
</i>[= to the praise of his glorious grace]<i> that he <u>freely bestowed</u>
on us in the Beloved.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 The previous two reasons for God’s
creating us (delight and grace) illustrate “transaction,” getting something out
of the activity in the very process of doing it. God also “gets something out
of” creating through “reciprocation,” getting something out of an activity when
the results of the work come back on the One who first did it. We glorify God
by our <u>worship</u>, <u>obedience</u>, and <u>service</u>. When we praise and
thank him for his common grace of creation and continued blessing, we glorify
him. Since he knows everything, he knew <i>“before the foundation of the world”</i>
(cp. Ephesians <b>1</b>:4) that we would respond that way to his previous
grace. So that “result” cannot entirely be separated in God’s mind from his “purpose”
for creating in the first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>How do we avoid the idea of a
self-centered creator if God made us for his own glory? What help is</b> <b>the
comparison with a couple who want children?</b> They know their kids will be
grateful for their blessings. Self-glorification is not the <u>first</u>
reason. Knowing ahead of time that we would sin did not stop him from making
us. He has given more than he will get. He knew we would sin and bring him
grief—as kids often do.<b> </b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 From <u>our</u> perspective, why is
it best to focus on God’s glory as the most important reason for being created?</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> It keeps <u>us</u> from being self-centered. We <u>need</u>
to praise. We may add that from <u>his</u> perspective, creating us provides an
opportunity for <u>him</u> to bestow himself on ones who have the ability to
appreciate it and be happy as a result of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 There are two main dimensions to
life: existence and hope. <u>Existence</u> includes all the aspects of our
present situation—our vertical and horizontal <i>relationships</i>, our <i>activities</i>
in those relationships, and our <i>nature</i> through which we experience what
goes on around us and in us (existential). <u>Hope</u> stresses the forward
movement of life that grows out of p<i>resent processes</i> and <i>outside
contributions</i> God will bring into history (eschatological). Together these
two aspects of living set up the context that provides for meaningful living.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Actual worth and our sense of worth lie
partially in positive <u>relationships</u> with other persons—both God and
people. <b>Explain how your set of friendships and activities “define” who you
are. </b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Which ones of these stand out as
positive and good, and why is that so? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>Are there any associations you
have that work against your sense of worth—as, for instance, by people’s “using”
you?</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Actual worth and our sense of worth
are also partially based in positive <u>purposes</u>. When we are tied into the
purposes of almighty God, we can rest assured that no third party will
frustrate what he plans to accomplish. Our participation in his purposes
provides an unmovable framework for objective—and therefore subjective—worth/value/meaning/</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>significance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>Why is it proper to say that if we
have moved away from relationship with our creator and have stepped aside from
his purposes for his creatures, we have lost most of our basis of worth?</b> If
this is so, no wonder so many people feel worthless, especially when they do
not realize God has made them in this image. That third basis of worth is the
subject of the next segment: the fact that we are created in God’s image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 The <u>purposes of mankind</u> (last
lesson) determine the <u>nature of mankind </u>(this lesson). The purpose of
something determines how it is made. The most <u>basic</u> thing we can say
about ourselves is the <u>first</u> thing God said about us: <i>“Let’s make mankind
in our image”</i>; <i>“let’s make mankind like us  </i>(Genesis <b>1</b>:26;
cp. Genesis <b>5</b>:1; <b>9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians<b> 11</b>:7; James<b> 3</b>:9,
and even Acts <b>17</b>:28-29). That statement reflects the interpersonal
nature of God himself: “<u>us</u>&quot; (cp. <b>3</b>:22; <b>11</b>:7; Isaiah<b>
6</b>:8). We can say that God’s image in us is the interpersonal capacity. He
constituted us for fellowship with him and other persons.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>What kinds of capacities do <u>people</u>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Persons can take responsibility. From
the beginning God gave us given responsibility: we w    ere to exercise
responsibility over the creation God placed us in (Genesis <b>1</b>:26-28). This
<u>commission</u> immediately connects with the statement about creating us in his
image. Specifically, the text of Genesis says that God commanded mankind to
till the ground and dress the Garden (<b>2</b>:5 + <b>3</b>:22;<b> 2</b>:16). Part
of what it means then to be in God’s image is the ability to take
responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Later, in Genesis <b>9</b>:1-7, after
God had destroyed humanity, he made the rainbow <u>covenant</u> with the
remaining family of Noah and his descendants. He did so at the same time as he
commanded mankind not to kill other people because they are in God’s image. An
agreement with promises and conditions takes place between persons and guides
their interaction. “Built-in law” governs impersonal reality, but covenants
hold persons together. Commissions and covenants imply that the ones who
receive them are responsible beings and therefore have interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 In the beginning, God gave mankind
two commandments, one positive and one negative. People <u>were</u> to exercise
dominion over the plant and animal kingdoms (Genesis <b>1</b>:26-30;<b> 2</b>:5-9).
They <u>were not</u> to eat from the “tree of knowledge” (Genesis <b>2</b>:16-17).
By making these commands and prohibitions, God put Adam and Eve in a “morality
matrix.” They existed in a setting where right and wrong applied. The tree of
knowledge corresponds with the principle of <u>free will</u>, which can cross
over the boundaries that revelation sets. <u>Adam and Eve</u> used free will to
disobey God’s injunction not to eat from the tree, and thereby they became <i>im</i>moral,
<i>un</i>ethical, beings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Likewise, <u>we</u> have received
revelation that specifies responsibilities and gives prohibitions. We exist in
a moral matrix as well. Like our first parents, when we sin, we become self-conscious,
which they reflected in trying to hide from God. The sense of guilt is largely
interpersonal. Guilt and self-consciousness relate to our unique characteristic
of blushing. Mankind has the capacity for morality, which is part and parcel of
what it means to be persons. Ethical being relates interpersonal capacity to
being in God’s image and likeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>What ethical and moral expectations

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 One more characteristic of
interpersonal beings is their capacity to communicate. In the beginning, God
revealed himself to mankind. God “said” to man; he did not genetically encode his
will into us. When Satan approached Eve, he played on our ability to be
influenced by words. Influence contrasts with force as the way one person
affects another person’s behavior. Human language is unique to interpersonal
capacity and relationship in keeping with its deriving from the rational
capacity. Ultimately, this set of abilities fits into the idea that God’s image
in us is our interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>How can we use our communicating

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>What does our interpersonal nature
and our communicative ability imply about how to have fulfillment and
happiness?</b> We need to be around other people in positive relationships. We
need to express ourselves verbally. These observations about ourselves relate
to the effectiveness of “talk therapy,” counseling, fellowship.</span></p>

The things he tells us to do or refrain from doing are not arbitrary. They help
us live in ways that fit with how God created us (our <u>nature</u>—Image of
God). They foster happy and harmonious <u>relationship</u> with him, other
people, and our surroundings. They further the <u>purposes</u> he had in creating
us, and they remove hindrances to the healthy purposes we get in our minds for
ourselves as well. Sin works against our nature, relationships, and purposes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 When we sin, we break a standard of
behavior; we are <u>guilty</u>. But there is more to it than that. We also must
face the ones we have sinned against. <b>Would you agree that the feeling of
guilt is one of the most devastating experiences a person can have? What
happens in extreme cases of a guilt complex?</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Once sin entered the human race, it
continued to move from person to person and from generation to generation down
to our own day. In our own experience, we get it started and keep it moving “unassisted.”
Sometimes we get help from other people! In this section we are thinking about
some ways our <b>ignorance</b> can get sin started and keep it moving without
much input other people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 (1) There are different kinds of
ignorance. Ignorance can be <u>simply not knowing</u> that something is wrong. We
may never have been told that it is not good for us, what consequences it
brings. Effects can take a while to show up, or they are subtle enough that we
miss the connection between what we are doing and the bad effects that come
from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>Can you think of something you got
started doing without realizing it was bad for you or the people around you?</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 (2) Another kind of ignorance is the
simple fact that <u>God is invisible</u> to us (John <b>1</b>:18; Colossians <b>1</b>:15;
1 Timothy<b> 6</b>:16; Hebrews <b>11</b>:27; 1 John <b>4</b>:12, plus many Old
Testament passages like Exodus <b>33</b>:20). <i>“Out of sight, out of mind”</i>
leads to <i>“out of mind, no effect on behavior.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>Can you see how it contributed to
your weakness in the face of temptation? Do you see any tendency on your part
to do what you would not do if God were more real to you? </b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 How can we offset the effect that God’s
invisibility may have on our behavior </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>by
doing what helps keep his real presence in front of us: spiritual exercises
like Bible reading, prayer, fellowship with other Christians, meditation,
worship—in short, whatever raises the level of our God-consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>Why do you suppose God does not “show
his face” to us if his invisibility is having this negative effect on us?</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 (3) A third kind of ignorance is <u>the
viewpoint from which we look at things</u>. Since we look at the world from our
own eyes, we can do things that harm or offend other people simply because “we
don’t stop and think.” This situation results in self-centeredness. <b>What can
we do to minimize this problem?</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 We have been thinking about our “nature”
as sinners. Besides different kinds of <u>ignorance</u>, we get into sinful
practices because of other <u>people’s influence</u> and our own <u>bodily
desires</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Social influence includes more than
just <u>sinful example</u>. The sin around us is not just there; it is aimed at
us in <u>social pressure</u>. Beyond that, when we “go along with the crowd,” they
praise and accept us. That adds <u>social reinforcement</u>—the tendency to
repeat behavior that gains approval. There are even cases of <u>misinterpreted
good example</u>. We misread what another person is doing and end up doing
something we should not. <b>Can you think of situations where that might happen
(1 Corinthians 8; Romans 14)?</b> Weaker brother situations afford ready
examples.                      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 <b>How can we counteract negative
evil influence? </b>(1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:33]). Avoiding evil people removes
lots of temptation (Hebrews <b>10</b>:19-25). Stay around good people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Our bodily desires are not wrong in
themselves, but we can satisfy them the wrong way. So our physical constitution
becomes an important doorway for sin to enter (James <b>1</b>:14-15). <b>How
can we help eliminate sin that comes in through the physical aspect of our
nature (1 Corinthians 7:1-2)?</b> One idea is to fulfill bodily desires in
acceptable ways; materials in <i>Basic Christianity</i> under “Coping with
Temptation” may help here.</span></p>
