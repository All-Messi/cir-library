<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            By creation, all human
persons have the image of God, which means they have the interpersonal capacity
and equal inherent worth. Since the image exists at the individual level, we
must view the created variants as “modes of the image.” Sex, race, size,
intelligence, athletic ability, physique, age, and the like do not affect
inherent worth and can therefore have no place in our attitude toward ourselves
or other people. We do not have to be married to participate in the image, we
do not have to become Jews to be a favored people, we do not have to speak
English to be part of the kingdom, <i>etc</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            While the image exists at
the individual level, it makes possible the social and eschatological
dimensions of living. Relationship and purpose bring behavior into the picture,
and the evaluation of behavior becomes necessary. Acts that impact fellowship
and purpose are subject to ethical and moral considerations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Honoring cultural variance,
ethnic diversity, gender distinctions, and nationality differences does not
imply that all behavioral differences in these arenas are equally valid,
appropriate, and acceptable to Christian convictions. The criterion for
acceptableness does not rest in human nature so much as in divine purpose. Human
nature is capable of a wider range of behavior that value and purposes permit. Unlike
animals, we are not constituted with a one-for-one relationship between nature
and behavior. We live by values and purposes, not just by drives, so Christianity
has a prophetic role in culture as surely as it does to the individuals, and
not all cultures are created equal. Revealed values and purposes distinguish
germane from non-germane matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Consequently, Christianity
does not subscribe to multicultural<u>ism</u> and the moral neutrality of all
diversity; that is, theology differs from the secular view of culture and
diversity. Nevertheless, Christians are deeply concerned about creating unity
across irrelevant diversity by using the attitude of Christ (Philippians <b>2</b>:2-11)
to overcome the divisive consequences of the self-centered, competitive
mindset. In fact, salvation as reconciliation (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:14-21)
endeavors to create a new united mankind (Ephesians <b>2</b>:15) by bringing us
individually into personal relationship with God through Christ. Our role as
Christians is to do what we can to realize this process wherever we can exert
our influence to do so.</span></p>
