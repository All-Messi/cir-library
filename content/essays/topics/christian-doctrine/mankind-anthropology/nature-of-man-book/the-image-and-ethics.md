<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> The theory of <u>meaning</u>,
the basis for <u>self-image</u>, and the theory of <u>ethics</u> all three
reference the same factors: being, action, and relationship. The previous
chapter discussed meaning and self-image as the objective and subjective sides
of the same thing. This chapter notes that ethics belongs to action in the
interpersonal sphere. Since we have identified the image of God with the
interpersonal capacity, it remains for us to explicate the principles for
ethical theory that grow out of the construct established by God’s creating us
in his (a) interpersonal image for (b) fellowship and (c) purpose. Action
connects the first item with each of the last two. Image defines human <u>nature/being</u>,
which behavior ties to <u>relationship</u> and <u>purpose</u>. Relationship and
purpose are relational since action relates persons to others in fellowship and
relates them to the results of their deeds. Action connects being to relations
(ethics) even as action connected objective and subjective in the previous
chapter (meaning).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Ethics and morality pertain
to persons in association. Person-thing and thing-thing relationships do not
involve moral right or wrong. The diagram below organizes the dimensions of
life in terms of personal factors. Life has two aspects that we have labeled
the “existential” and the “eschatological.” The existential refers to the
experience of “existence” including vertical relationships <u>vertically</u>
with God (A-1), <u>horizontally</u> with other people (A-2), and <u>internally</u>
between the inner and outer man–spirit and flesh (A-3). Eschatological refers
to the forward movement of life from purposes to goals. The primary ethical
principles correspond with the aspects of these two main dimensions of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <i>Loving God with all
our being</i> is the most primary ethical principle (Matthew <b>22</b>:34-38;
Mark <b>12</b>:28-30; Luke <b>10</b>:25-28a). Since love is principled behavior
for the joy of others, it is more than a feeling; it is a pattern of behavior
characterized by self-giving for the glory of God. If we love him, we do what
he says (John <b>14</b>:23, 15) and will not feel “put upon” (1 John <b>5</b>:3).
Love is an act because it can be commanded; it is a pattern of action that is
outwardly directed for the joy of others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. A-2: The Golden Rule/The Second
Great Commandment</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> The Golden Rule
governs relationships between people (Matthew <b>7</b>:12): <i>t</i><i>reating
other people the way we want to be treated</i>. Treating other people the way
we want to be treated restates the Second Great Commandment that we should love
our neighbor as we love ourselves (Matthew <b>22</b>:39-40; Mark <b>10</b>:31;
Luke <b>10</b>:29b-37; Romans <b>13</b>:8-10; Galatians<b> 5</b>:13-14). It
gives a “rule-of-thumb” basis for deciding how one person ought to act toward
another one, and it does so in a positive as well as negative sense. Again,
love is an action because it commanded; besides, it is a pattern of action that
is outwardly directed for the joy of others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (a) Morality is more
than <u>not doing</u> what we would not want done to us; (b) it is also <u>doing</u>
what is to someone else’s benefit. Furthermore, (c) it is a matter of doing
what we would <u>prefer</u> to have done to us even though not doing it would
not be sin, even though it would not be necessary, or even though it would not
otherwise make life intolerable (note “seemly” in 1 Corinthians<b> 13</b>:5). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Furthermore, (d) the
Golden Rule takes into account the way <u>they</u> want to be treated. It takes
into account the differences between people. So it is not just a matter of
treating other people the way <u>we</u> want to be treated; it is a matter of
treating them the way we would want to be treated if we were in their shoes. That
ends up meaning we treat them the way they want to be treated. That broad
principle in the Golden Rule/Second Great Commandment is limited, of course, by
the First Great Commandment, by our own integrity as persons, and by their
responsibilities as persons. Treating other people the way they want to be
treated is limited by their own need to love God and respect us. Love is mutual
respect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. A-3: The superiority of spirit over
flesh</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Asserting <i>the
priority of spirit over flesh</i><b> </b>governs activity within the individual
person. In 1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:12 Paul says he will<b> </b>not be brought
under the power of anything. The principle he enunciates takes care of why it
is wrong to do private practices that cause addictions and psychological
compulsions (“hangups”). Consequently, he goes beyond the notion of “victimless
crimes,” acts that supposedly do not impact anyone but the doer himself. Something
is wrong if it puts physical drives in ultimate position. Immorality does not
apply just to those behaviors that can be measured quantitatively relative to
physical consequences; it applies also to what brings psychological
difficulties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> As a principle for use
of our bodies, asserting the supremacy of spirit over flesh differs from
arguing that we should do what is physically most healthful because our body is
the Spirit’s temple (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:19). Sometimes what harms the body
may take second place to interpersonal considerations implicit in A-1, A-2, and
B-1. For example, certain foods are less healthful for the body than others;
yet Jesus did cleanse all meats (Mark <b>7</b>:19), which means at least that
dietary laws no longer belong to <u>religious</u> concern; that is, they are
not Christian ethical considerations. “Cleansing all meats” does not change the
<u>scientific</u> fact that some foods are less healthful particularly for some
people. We infer that the body as the temple of the Spirit does not form the
ultimate basis for arguing the <u>moral</u> need to eat what research shows is
most healthful and to avoid eating what can cause heart conditions, cancer,
high cholesterol, <i>etc.</i> Paul’s positive approach to ethics within the
individual centers around addictiveness, which breaches the principle of
prioritizing spirit over flesh. Perhaps his real point is that the body is the
residence of the spirit (not Holy Spirit); so we must not use the body in a way
that puts the spirit under the body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>The one-to-many
splice</u>. Ethics not only addresses individual and social behavior; it
describes the boundary between individual freedom and social responsibility. <i>Individual
freedom ends where other individuals’ freedom begins</i>. Most “victimless
crimes” do not affect just the ones who do them, because people’s lives are
intertwined in such a way that the behavior of one eventually impacting others.
Similarly, private acts between “consenting adults” are matters of morality
because the repercussions of private acts can end up costing society money,
effort, and time. They can also depersonalize the other consenting adult and
may prioritize flesh over spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <i>Our individual
actions must leave us able to be responsible for ourselves</i>. What we do is
immoral if it makes us unable to function appropriately in relationships and
purposes (relate to B-1).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>IV. B-1: Right and wrong are measured
relative to purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <i>Right and wrong,
good and bad are measured relative to purpose</i>. In behavior the ultimate
issue is not whether something is legal under a temporal or divine standard,
but whether it is effective. Abiding principles applicable in all cases are
relative to the standing purposes of God and mankind. Obviously, since we are
dependent beings, we cannot define our own ultimate purpose. The purpose
measurement for ethics is first God’s purpose, within which our self-chosen,
secondary purposes are to be worked out; in that framework God allows us
considerable freedom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <i>Right and wrong
focus on motives and attitude more than on sheer acts</i> <i>alone</i>. The
same act can be good or bad depending on why we do it and depending on our
attitude toward other people when we do it. A normally good act becomes evil if
done out of selfish motives or with a depersonalizing attitude. In
interpersonal activity, intentionality counts for something important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <i>Morality includes
not only what is or is not <u>wrong</u>, but what is <u>wise</u>.</i> Wisdom
brings in practical considerations. Some things may not break any of God’s
abiding principles of behavior strictly speaking, but it is normally not wise
for people to put themselves in certain situations. What is possible is not
necessarily smart for the persons themselves because he may not be as strong as
he thinks he is. Standing outside the force field of certain situations, he may
suppose that he can handle more than he can. Not only does wisdom deal with the
doer himself (which applies also in the “one-many splice” under A-3); it deals
with practical effects on other people. It addresses what other people prefer,
what other people may easily misread about our motives, what other people may
be led into doing on the basis of their misreading. So, not only is there <u>commandment</u>;
there is <u>advice</u>. And where there is neither commandment nor advice, <u>love</u>
and <u>expediency</u> must reign. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>The
existential-eschatological splice</u>. As there is a point of contact in the
existential aspect between individuals and their group, so also there is a
point of contact between the existential and the eschatological. <i>Right and
wrong are measured relative to <u>purpose</u> as qualified by <u>love</u></i><b>.</b>
Latitude and longitude (the existential and the eschatological) combine in
ethical choices. <i>Ethics prioritizes <u>purpose</u> over <u>pleasure</u></i>–spiritual
over material–because purposes are chosen relative to values not rooted in
material considerations, but in interpersonal ones (love). Spiritual and
interpersonal are closely related if not identified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> <u>Consistency</u>
provides a summarizing moral principle for consistency between behavior and the
nature of the situation, between behavior and purpose, and between behavior and
promise. Consistency for God is between his nature and purposes and between his
promises and behavior. Consistency for us is between our behavior and God’s
values and purposes for us. Appropriateness and consistency involve restricted
freedom rather than positive determinism. There is freedom within a framework;
we are free to act in ways that fit the circumstances. Consistency does not
generate the specific acts, but limits what acts we may choose. In the context
of consistency, <u>love</u> and <u>expediency</u> provide the positive factors
that generate specific acts in vertical and horizontal relationships between
persons. Love is holistic because it combines feelings and principles and
unites self and others. There needs to be a consistency in love as principled
caring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Righteousness deals
with personal-interpersonal considerations. It addresses what is directly
interpersonal, what is intrapersonal, and what grows out of interpersonal
(purpose). Righteousness involves internal attitude (motives) as well as
external behavior (actions). Righteousness is both horizontal (love for people)
and vertical (love for God). It means doing what we can to improve the quality
of relationship (positive), not just to keep it from getting worse (neutral and
negative). Righteousness relates to purpose because persons purpose; they do so
by making choices relative to values and goals more than drives. Righteousness
is interpersonal, not just legal; it involves more than a <u>conceptual
standard</u>. Righteousness is relational, not just <u>natural</u>; it involves
more than what is best for the body—our bodies may get crucified because of our
choices. Righteousness is consistent with the existence of other persons and
the future; it is not just an emotional <u>feeling</u>, a physical <u>drive</u>,
or an intuitive <u>impulse</u>. </span></p>

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Righteousness is
behavior consistent with the interpersonal situation; it is principled love. It
is made possible by the interpersonal capacity created into us when God made us
in his image.</span></p>
