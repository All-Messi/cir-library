themselves; and so the question seems about God’s reason for creating us. Issues
get complicated when we try to distinguish our own understanding from other
ones and when we have to give reasons against such alternatives, especially if
they overlap our own.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> As in
our positive presentation so also in evaluating other positions,
interpersonalism serves as the criterion for what is foreign and contradictory
to what scripture says about the nature and purpose of God and man. </span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since the reformation, the most common
explanation for creating us is that we exist to glorify God. Scripture often
commands us to glorify him, and divine glory is the effect of all right living
and worship. In giving reasons God made us, we have qualified that traditional
answer by seeing it in an interpersonal framework. We have adjusted divine
glory away from being the ultimate, primary, central <u>purpose</u> to being a
secondary <u>result</u><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> so
that divine glory does <u>not logically come first</u>. We have been conceiving
of it from an <u>objective viewpoint</u> and made it <u>an indirect result</u>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The difference between the two ideas about
divine glory corresponds to whether we consider Ephesians <b>1</b>:4 a
statement of originating purpose or of natural result. Grammatically, <i>unto</i>
(<i>eis</i>) could mean either (1) God’s electing people in Christ before the
foundation of the world could be for the purpose of his own glory or with what
results result in his glory. We have chosen result because it harmonizes better
with the interpersonal framework in which we believe this matter stands,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> and because we are “<i>eis</i>”
the praise of the glory of his grace. If it is for the glory of God’s grace,
then grace is prior to the glory. Divine election is conditioned on foreseen
human responses are conditions for divine election, which means it is not
deterministic.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since the sovereign God that loves also
knows everything, he <i>“sees the end from the beginning”</i> (Isaiah <b>46</b>:9-10;
cp. <b>41</b>:21-26;<b> 44</b>:7; <b>45</b>:21). He foresaw that people would
glorify him for his goodness. Parents “know” that their children will
appreciate them for what they are doing for them, but that is not their motive
for “gracing” them or for having them in the first place. Interpersonal sovereignty
expresses itself in a way that fits with fellowship; it takes into
consideration other people’s ability to choose. Interpersonalism in God adjusts
his omnipotence, sovereignty, and individuality to what fits with the existence
of the other persons he decided to create.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our first objection to prioritizing divine
glory is that <b>(1)</b> self-glorification is unnatural to interpersonal
relationships. It does sound right to say that our purpose is to glorify God, but
such an idea emanates from <u>our</u> perspective. In the context of God’s
purpose for <u>making</u> us, it becomes questionable: God made us to glorify
himself.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> That sounds like a
self-centered God, who uses other persons for himself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our reason for making divine glory an
indirect result is that it seems more biblical as well as more natural to
interpersonalism as the biblical worldview. Scripture does not seem to mean
that God does things directly for his own <u>glory</u>. It says instead that he
does all his <u>pleasure</u> (Isaiah <b>46</b>:10). We want to avoid the
specter of self-centered deity, so we exalt God’s goodness without detracting
from his greatness. Putting self-glorification in first place seems unnatural
to holiness and love (goodness). With God as well as us, <i>“It is more blessed
</i>[fulfilling?]<i> to give than to get”</i> (Acts<b> 20</b>:35). The
Proverbial writer says, <i>“Let another praise you and not your own lips” </i>(<b>27</b>:2;
cp. <b>25</b>:27?). Healthy personalities are outward directed instead of <i>“Look
at me.”</i> We suppose that God has a “healthy personality” and that his sense
of delight and fulfillment come in social activities—from self-giving
(transactionalism) aside from the response of the blessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Self-centered holiness and self-centered
love are contradictions of terms. That stricture can be lessened by saying that
(1) God is justified in self-centeredness because he actually is the greatest;
so there is no impropriety in his creating persons to acknowledge his
greatness. Furthermore, (2) in creating other persons to glorify himself, God
did not make them in such a way as to have that glory at their expense. Particularly,
(3) since God created us with freedom of the will, the self-glorification
purpose would be realized through human free-will response. God would not contradict
the interpersonal model since he does not force us to love him back. He does
not manipulate persons in impersonal ways. In fact, (4) creating for his own
glory has the secondary effect of creating for people’s fulfillment by giving
them opportunity to acknowledge God’s greatness, to relate to him in that
greatness, and to experience his purposes being fulfilled through them. It
gives them the experience of meaningfulness and beauty. There is admittedly a
difference between self-centered reasons and self-benefiting reasons. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Even with these clarifications,
self-glorification strains interpersonalism. Self-glorification implies a
self-centered <u>attitude</u> even if it does not force or manipulate other
persons to give the glory. “Using” people means more than by-passing their
capacity to choose and make commitment; it degrades the other in the mind of
the self. It “prostitutes” them much as intercourse without marriage does even
with a willing partner. By its very nature, interpersonalism precludes seeking
personal satisfaction by using persons as non-persons; the “inter” is thereby
lost. So, we have emphasized that <u>in</u> God’s giving is his receiving
(transactionalism).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As human persons are not an end in
themselves, so also God is not an end in himself. People are responsible for
what is beyond themselves. The same holds true for a personal God. By freely
choosing to enter a relationship, God is not an absolute end that eliminates
mutuality. He is a “God for others” in that he is a “God of love.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The most extreme form of self-glorification
glorifying by depersonalizing mankind is the belief that God made—in effect <u>most</u>—people
for the very purpose of destroying them! The idea comes from misreading Romans <b>9</b>:22,
<i>“What if God, wanting to show his wrath and make his power known, endured
with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fit for destruction?” </i>The
interpretation comes out as meaning that before times eternal <u>God</u> “fitted”
most vessels for destruction because he wanted to show his anger at sin and his
power to overcome it. But nobody makes <u>vessels</u> for the very purpose of
destroying them—much less have <u>children</u> for that reason! If he did make
them for destruction, why make them as <u>vessels</u>? Why give them <u>any</u>
design? Why not make them ornaments or toys? Making them vessels implies making
them for the purpose that vessels serve. It would be pointless, if not
inconsistent and at cross purposes, to make something designed for a purpose
while intending to destroy it. Creating <u>persons</u> to destroy them would be
inconsistent because God would be giving them personal capacities and then
treating them as if they did not have those capacities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Moreover, destroying people to demonstrate
<u>power</u> does not demonstrate much power. There is more power and skill
demonstrated in constructing something than in destroying it. If it is for
anger against <u>sin</u>, God could simply wait till people chose to sin and
chose to refuse redemption from sin, and then destroy them for it.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Instead of making people’s fellowship with
God unconditional, we need to see it as conditional because it is <u>inter</u>personal.
The way God’s glory comes must fit with the way God’s sovereignty operates. Making
his sovereignty unconditional makes his glory <u>im</u>personal because it
removes the creatures’ capacity to choose for or against the conditions God
lays down. Sovereignty—and therefore glory—in an unconditional system means
that God must make the vessels for the express purpose of destroying them
because they have no choice to misuse those gifts andqualify <u>themselves</u>
for destruction by God. For sovereignty, fellowship, and glory to be
conditional and personal, we must retain free will in our understanding of our
nature. </span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Making us to destroy most of us creates
divine inconsistency in an even more serious manner: <b>(2)</b> it makes him
the author of our sins. Destroyed vessels correspond to destroyed people. People
are destroyed for sin. If God made us to destroy us, he would have made us with
a nature that would make us sin so he could destroy us. It is obvious that
guilt applies at the point of decision. If we have no ability to choose other
than sin, it is questionable whether we can even speak of our sinning. We do
not say animals sin when they harm one another. The only choosing would be God’s
choosing to make us who would necessarily do evil. God, not Satan, would become
the father of sin.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Especially <b>(3)</b> if
self-glorification is <u>central</u> to why God created us, the fact of sin
works against the purpose of God. <u>Most</u> of us will be lost,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> and <u>all</u> of us fall short
of God’s glory (Romans <b>3</b>:23); yet we cannot thwart God’s purpose. Evidently,
we must re-define God’s purpose so that it is not absolute relative to his
glory. We need to re-define God’s purpose so it does not absolutize any one
thing on either side of the relationship. In personal relationships, there are
more than one person and more than one motive out of which each of those
persons operates. In regard to one Person’s creating another, our understanding
of the reason(s) for it should not collapse it into one side or their other—unconditional
divine sovereignty or absolute human freedom—and we should not reduce it to one
motive—self-glorification. That is why we have <u>combined</u> personal delight,
goodness toward the other, and divine glory as reasons for creating mankind. That
is why we <u>qualified</u> glory by making it secondary as a foreseen
conditional result rather than primary as a decreed unconditional purpose. Lessening
the degree of any one motive does not destroy it or undo the combination. Our
sin does not destroy God’s glory because self-glorification is not the primary
reason for making us.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, <b>(4) </b>centralizing divine
glory detracts from it. It does so by detracting from human dignity, which we
shy away from doing, not because of human pride, but because of divine praise. In
unnecessarily reducing human dignity, we reduce God’s glory in whose image he
made us. God is great enough that we do not have to lower ourselves so he can
stand above us. We are more satisfied, more fulfilled, and more glorified if we
are loved, obeyed, and served by others who choose to do so than by something
that cannot do otherwise. As long as we do not go beyond what is written about
mankind, dignifying others exalts and glorifies their creator all the more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We prefer to think that God is great
enough that he does not need to create others to praise his greatness.<b> </b>It
seems more appropriate to say that God <u>desires</u> to be appreciated. He has
enough “ego strength” not to <u>need</u> praise for what he does. Supposing
that God created us to praise himself amounts to creating God in our fallen
image, because that is the kind of self-centered thing we do in our fallenness.
To turn this matter in the opposite direction, we wonder with the psalmist how
God could even be glorified by people’s paltry praise (Psalm<b> 8</b>:1-4),
much less claim that he created us mainly for that reason. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Centralizing God’s glory comes from
misformulating divine sovereignty. Whenever people conceive of sovereignty as
status, power, and authority aside from the qualifying effects of the social
setting (love), they reduce God from person to power (force) or from person to
principle (holiness). They think about his functioning as if he were not a
person; they picture his operation as if it he worked like a force, idea, or
law. They treat interpersonal operation as if it were the same as chemical,
logical, or legal operation. As a universal principle, it is true enough that
God acts as he does because he delights in doing so, and that is the only
consideration with <u>things</u> (nature, force, chemistry). But as soon as he
brings other <u>persons</u> into the picture, he delights himself in accordance
with the nature of the persons he brings in.  His sovereignty takes a different
form, though it is sovereignty still. His holiness becomes more complex, though
it is holiness still. It is adjusted by the nature of the interpersonal case he
created. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We should make one important concession to
putting “glorify God” (<u>glory</u>) ahead of “enjoy him forever” (a result of
his <u>goodness</u>) as the Westminster Shorter Catechism does, for example.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9 </span>That arrangement is appropriate
from <u>our</u> perspective, and perhaps that was why the Catechism was written
that way. The statement deals with divine glory more from the standpoint of
what we want to do than what God wants us to do. Such an attitude looks at our
role from inside <u>our</u> experience with God. It looks at it from <u>our</u>
psychological point of view (existential) rather than from the objective
viewpoint (analytical) used in chapter one. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Both</u> persons in a healthy
relationship rise above their individual viewpoints. <u>Both</u> project
consciousness over behind the eyes of the other and look at the relationship
from there. Down inside the situation we, who are to act like God, need to
begin with others and function in an outwardly directed manner. That means that
<u>in</u> our self-giving service—as <u>in</u> God’s self-giving grace—there is
love demonstrated and satisfaction experienced prior to any reward received on
the return side of the association, all the more so on our part because all of
us experience the goodness of God’s common grace before we respond to it. We
respond to what already is rather than create from sheer nothing. In responding
to what we receive, we “add” the increase we have individually made to the “talents”
first given us (quantity) as well as the gratitude and praise we freely give
(quality). Putting “glorify God” ahead of “enjoy him forever” also acknowledges
the priority and superiority of God over us. We are both personal, but we are
not equal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As a final comment on centralizing
self-glorification, we note that terminology can be a problem. People may be
thinking broadly when they say that God made us to “glorify” him. They may be
presupposing the four qualifying factors noted earlier, and may be including,
even prioritizing, in the word <i>glorify</i> what we have meant by “delight.” If
so, it relieves much of our concern, and we can summarize the proper picture
under this usage of <i>glorify</i> as follows. The reason for God’s <u>general
creation</u> is his own glory in the sense of delight. His <u>impersonal
creation</u> is directly for his delight both transactionally and reciprocally.
In regard to <u>personal creation</u>, the manner of glorification shifts to
conform to the character of interpersonal operation. Delight-glory from
self-expression continues and reciprocate-glory from voluntary response is
added. Reciprocate-glory is not the originating motive but the foreseen result.
There is still a distinction between purpose and result despite omniscience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In summary, because God is interpersonal,
his goodness encompasses his glory, not the other way around. God’s love and
holiness are more basic than his glory. Goodness precedes gain. God avoided
inappropriate self-glorification by going ahead with creating us though he knew
we would sin, by first giving us more than he later gets from us, by offering us
redemption, by making glory voluntary, and by knowing that it would come from
only a remnant. Glory is preserved, however, because people are <u>misusing</u>
God’s gifts when they choose to sin (so our sin is not a reflection on him),
because the disobedient majority use the very skills God gave them when they
disobey him, and they sin in the face of a redemption option. In the end, God
preserves holiness toward the wicked, love for the righteous, and appropriate
glorification of himself by exerting omnipotence in the final overthrow of
unrepentant evil. The glory of God is not the absolute or ultimate reason for
creating us because (1) it would imply a self-centered God, (2) it would make
God the author of sin, (3) it would not fit with foreseen sin, and (4) it would
take away from his glory. Viewed from our perspective, however, God’s glory is our
ultimate purpose.</span></p>

originate from a concept called <i>“the great chain of being.”</i> Those
reasons come from writers ancient to modern, Jewish, Christian, and pagan. The
idea is that all reality forms an ascending sequence from lowest matter to
highest deity. This “chain” was sometimes as a <u>static arrangement</u> of the
way reality is. One adaptation of the scheme makes it <u>ideal rather than real</u>;
not everything is there from the first, but comes into being over time. Another
adaptation considered the chain <u>dynamic rather than static</u>; beings can
move up and down the levels in the ladder.<span style='position:relative;

an object to give to.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> The
difficulty here does not lie in God’s creating us as someone give to, but in
his having to do so to maintain his own goodness. There is a difference between
doing something a person wants to do and doing something he has to do. In this
case God would not be acting freely or sovereignly. His goodness would not have

and then made people to fill out the rest of the “perfect number.” The
difference between the two variations corresponds with a difference in writers’
beliefs about when the angels fell. The first view assumed angels were made
first, some of them fell, and then God created people to replace the fallen

is connects with the present body; that is a “mystery” (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:51-54).

(44-46), “heavenly” body (47-49) that is incorruptible and immortal (50-54). At
least “flesh and blood” cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven (50), and even
those who are alive at Christ’s return will be changed (51-52; cp. Matthew <b>17</b>:1-8,
<i>etc</i>.?). In 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:1-6 Paul speaks of “clothes” and “a
dwelling” that will replace what is destroyed and mortal so we will not be
naked and unclothed. At least eventually we will apparently be more than what
is left when the mortal “part” dies, whether we can stretch the word “corporeal”

“spiritual body” of some kind. Even if we resurrect to pure spirit, that will
not make us angels any more than it will make them deity because <i>“God is [a]
spirit”</i> (John <b>4</b>:24). Some variety evidently exists in the spirit
realm because angels and deity are different if only in rank, authority, or
power. That variety may be as great in the spiritual realm as it is in the
physical. From revelation, then, we cannot tell what the nature of spirit is or
what the spiritual body is for resurrected people. Consequently, neither from
biblical statements nor from the nature of spirit do we have a basis for
concluding that human beings become angels.<span style='position:relative;

it misunderstands sovereignty, especially if by omnipotence God can get his
work done with the number of angels he originally made or had left after some
of them fell. The arrangement of abstract pattern above real Person sounds like
the ancient concept of the Fates, to which even the gods were subject. The fact
that God originally made a given, hence “full,” number of angels does not mean
his sovereignty would be forfeit if he did not re-establish that full number. Out
of the full number of people, there is only a remnant restored even through
redemption. We do not argue for universalism because the full number of people
God made must be restored to preserve his sovereignty. In the first place, God
sovereignly chose that people could choose for or against fellowship with him,
and he sovereignly chose what destinies there would be for each choice. The

Paul asks in passing<i>, “Don’t you know that <u>we will judge angels</u>?”</i>
(1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:3). Since <u>angels serve people</u>, some infer that
they rank below people, although admittedly their service to mankind no more
implies their inferiority to us than it implies Christ’s inferiority to us. In <b>2</b>:14
the Hebrew writer says of them, <i>“Are they not all ministering spirits, sent

translation could be, <i>“You made [mankind] a <u>little-while</u> lower than
the angels.”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>19 </span>The latter
rendering implies the opposite sequence for the rank of us and angels. The
ambiguity, however, between <u>our</u> being “a little lower” than the angels
and our being “a little while lower” may come into the reading of this text
because of <u>Jesus</u>’ temporary identification with us. He who is above the
angels moves below them by incarnation and returns to where he was by
resurrection and ascension. That is different from <u>our</u> being above the
angels; it confuses us with Christ. We suspect that Psalm <b>8</b> is speaking
of people in general and that any inclination to read time into the Hebrew
writer’s argument comes from facts about Christ’s temporary incarnation to
become our representative. Furthermore, if we will judge angels and become
higher than angels, we would not become angels but something above angels. Psalm
<b>8</b> might show that beings can move up the chain of being, but it does not
prove that they move up the chain to replace fallen angels.</span></p>

least for now, could also be argued, not only from the first translation for
Hebrews<b> 2</b>:7 (“a little lower”), but also from 2 Peter <b>2</b>:11. After
speaking of human false prophets and teachers, the text describes angels as “greater
in strength and power.” Whether that changes in the afterlife is moot. As a
result, though angels appear to rank above us, that position has been
questioned; but even if they do, that fact would not further the idea that God
made us to move up the chain of being and fill out their number after they

move up (and down) the chain. When <u>dynamic progress</u> comes into the

himself (Matthew <b>17</b>:1-7 = Mark <b>9</b>:2-8; Luke <b>9</b>:28-36). What

reason for creating us is any proposal that implicitly makes God dependent
being. For example, ancient pagans sometimes offered their sacrifices to feed
the gods. One reason those gods would bring calamities on people was for their
failure to provide sacrificial food. God did not institute animal sacrifice
among the Israelites because of some desire for what was offered. The function
of the offerings was not to feed him: <i>“If I were hungry, I would not tell
you, because the world is mine and the fullness of it. Will I eat the flesh of
bulls or drink the blood of goats?’</i> (Psalm<b> 50</b>:12-13). Through
Jeremiah God says to Israel, <i>“I did not speak to your fathers . . . out of a
concern for sacrifices” </i>(<b>7</b>:22).<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>27 </span>Mosaic sacrifices were not for God’s benefit, but for the
sinner’s benefit, because the death of the animal was viewed either as a
substitute for the death of the one who offered it or as an expression of love
to the God who gave life and breath and all things, including the offering
itself. </span></p>

making us include Genesis <b>1</b>:26-28; <b>2</b>:5, 15; Psalm <b>8</b>:3-8;
Ecclesiastes <b>12</b>:13; Acts <b>17</b>:24-28; 1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:13,
19-20; Ephesians<b> 1</b>:3-14; and 1 Peter <b>2</b>:9. In an interpersonal
framework, we have organized those reasons in the order of delight, goodness,
and glory. <u>Delight</u> means that God sensed fulfillment in the very process
of creating all things, including us. <u>Goodness</u> means that God created us
as that on which he could more fully bestow himself. <u>Glory</u> means that in
response to God’s previous grace, our gratitude, praise, and obedience to
mission bring God the glory he foresaw would come. Our mission is twofold: we
are stewards of creation and caretakers of brothers; we exercise dominion over
the earth and proclaim reconciliation to all who have alienated themselves from
their creator. Delight and goodness account for our <u>reasons</u> for existing
in and of ourselves; glory accounts for our <u>purpose</u> beyond ourselves. The
purpose of people is fellowship with God and fulfillment of mission for him. The
purpose of <u>God</u> in creating people was to fulfill himself, have objects
of fellowship, and accomplish results through them. <u>Our</u> purpose is to
serve as an object of fellowship and fulfill mission in dominion and
proclamation. Delight and goodness are intentional <u>reasons</u> for creating us;
glory is a foreseen <u>result</u>. Any of those three terms could be expanded
to include what the others mean if appropriate adjustments are made.</span></p>

us include making (1) self-glorification central, which seems unnatural in an
interpersonal setting. Especially on the background of “the great chain of
being,” four reasons for our existence originated: (2) as a necessary
expression of goodness, which puts abstract principle above personal character;
(3) as replacements for fallen angels, an unrevealed notion; (4) as a link
between the corporeal and incorporeal realms, and (5) deification, which
normally means becoming godly or immortal but sometimes means more. Finally, we
were supposedly made (6) as a means of fulfilling God’s need, which does not
harmonize with God’s creatorship, omnipotence, aseity, and sovereignty.</span></p>

translated “willing,” “desiring,” or “wanting.” Greek participles simply
connect nouns and verbal ideas without indicating the <u>sense</u> in which
they connect. Participles may cover for noun-verbal relationships that are
linked by time, means, manner, cause, condition, concession, purpose, result,
attendant circumstance, coordinated circumstance, apposition; but a participle
in itself does not specify any one of these. The actual relationship between
the referent of the substantive and referent of the participle must come from
context and the nature of the case. Some interpreters who think <b>9</b>:22
means that God makes “vessels” for the purpose of destroying them appear to
take the participle in a causal sense: </span></p>

especially good sense because it contrasts what might be called God’s “impulse”
against sin and what he restrains himself from doing for the benefit of the
righteous: <i>“What if God, <u>though wanting</u> . . . ?”</i> (Moffatt,
Conybeare, NASV). The most accurate translation, however, leaves the connection
unspecified, <i>“What if God, <u>wanting</u> . . . ?”</i> (KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV,
Douay, Berkeley, <i>etc.</i>; the NIV virtually mistranslates the participle as
“<u>choosing</u>”). The causal interpretation seems not only foreign but
unnatural; a person does not put up with the objects of his wrath <u>because</u>
he wants to show his wrath. If anything, he does <u>not</u> put up with them.</span></p>

frequently pointed out about omniscience, at least during his incarnation Jesus
apparently did not know the time of his return (Matthew<b> 24</b>:36—because
the Father had not decided yet?). A fair number of manuscripts and ancient
versions, however, omit the phrase <i>“nor the Son,”</i> including the Latin

Received Text that descended from the latter as well as from <i>The Greek New

writers on this idea assumed that angels fell before people was made, but
Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109) argued that angels and people were created at
the same time because the apocryphal writing Ecclesiasticus <b>18</b>:1 says, <i>“He
that lives forever created all things together.” </i>Scripture itself does not
speak about the time of their fall, only to the fact of it (2 Peter <b>2</b>:4;
Jude 6; Genesis<b> 6</b>:1-4 + 1 Enoch <b>6-16</b>). In a passage about laying

is tempting to argue for a greater difference between angels and resurrected
people by saying that angels are pure spirits while resurrected people are
spirits plus spiritual bodies. <u>Angels</u> are not said to have bodies, and
demons—presumably fallen angels–yearn for bodily habitation of some sort as
implied by their drive to possess humans (Matthew <b>12</b>:43-45 = Luke <b>11</b>:24-26)
or even animals (Matthew <b>8</b>:28-34 = Mark <b>5</b>:1-17 = <b>8</b>:26-37).
They do so presumably to interact more naturally with this different kind of
realm to which they were cast down. <u>People</u> are said to have spiritual
bodies, which means they are not simply resuscitated corpses or disembodied
spirits, We speak of “spiritual body” because Paul speaks this way (1
Corinthians <b>15</b>:44), but we have little content in mind when we repeat
his words, because we have no independent knowledge of the nature of the
spiritual realm so as to link up his meaning with something we know through
experience. The transformation of the living at the general resurrection may
parallel the transfiguration of Jesus on the mountain with Elijah and Moses
(Matthew <b>17</b>:1-8 = Mark <b>9</b>:2-8). It is not clear to what extent
Christ’s post- resurrection appearances go beyond being a <u>proof</u> of his
resurrection to becoming a <u>pre-figure</u> of our resurrected bodies and
consequently an indication of the difference between angels and resurrected people.
The appearances included eating as well as being touched, seen, and heard. But
these were “appearances,” which involved activities that angels have also done
(Genesis <b>18</b>:1-15, <i>etc.</i>). Our “spiritual body,” however, evidently
differs from a physical body somehow made immortal; so our resurrected state is
closer to that of the angels than it is now, but that does not make their
natures the same. In <i>The Battle for the Resurrection </i>(Nashville, TN: Thomas
Nelson Publishers, l989), Norman Geisler interacts with the various options
interpreters have proposed on both Jesus’ resurrected body and every person’s
resurrection body.</span></p>

on the author involved, the notion of “perfect number” can mean simply the “full

eighteenth-century theology, “perfect number” progressed from the basic
actualities in “the chain of being” to the notion of “plenitude,” the
possibilities in that chain. The reasoning carried forward the idea that <b>(a)
</b>God’s goodness required him to create other <u>actualities</u> to shower
with his goodness. The added factor was <b>(b) </b>that God’s goodness would
not allow him to refuse the goodness of existence to <u>all good possibilities</u>
in the scale. Not only, then, did he have to create what was good, but he had
to create every possible thing that was good, if not by “now,” at least
eventually. This thought then got turned into a basis for optimism, the belief
that <b>(c)</b> this world is the best of all possible worlds.  “All good
possibilities” became more like “<u>all possibilities</u>” and so plenitude
involved the whole range of pain-causing entities as well. Lovejoy remarks that
such reasoning made optimism indistinguishable from Buddhist pessimism (<i>The
Great Chain of Being</i>, p. 218). </span></p>

interpreters have understood that service to include “guardian angels” for some
individuals (Matthew <b>18</b>:10; Acts <b>12</b>:15; Luke <b>15</b>:10?; <b>16</b>:22?;
Matthew <b>24</b>:31, <i>etc.</i>), nations (Daniel <b>10</b>:10-15, 20-<b>11</b>:1;<b>

although the last set of examples probably refers to the evangelist in these
churches or to a personification of the churches themselves.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>19</span>Two
translation questions come up in this passage. First, the word “angels” in
Hebrews<b> 2</b>:7 follows the Septuagint Greek translation of Psalm <b>8</b>:5,
which reads </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἄγγελοι</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<i>angeloi</i>)
where the Hebrew says </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt'>אֱלֹהִים</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span> (<i>’<sup>e</sup>lohim</i>).
The Hebrew text reads, <i>“You made [mankind] a little from <u>God</u>.”</i> In
this case, the regular word for “God” was rendered “angels” by the Septuagint
(the Hebrew word is plural in form and is translated plural when referring to
other than God, that is, to the pagan “gods,” angels, or <u>men</u> as in Psalm
<b>82</b>:1 + 6 and perhaps Exodus <b>21</b>:6?; <b>22</b>:8?). In general,
Hebrews follows the distinctives of the Septuagint and so reads “angels” in <b>2</b>:7,
9. The LXX also has “angels” for </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:
14.0pt'>אֱלֹהִים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-size:
12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>in Psalm <b>137</b>:1
(= MT <b>138</b>:1) and in some readings for Daniel <b>2</b>:11. Since Hebrews
bases its argument on “angels” in <b>2</b>:7, 9, we take it to be a correct
understanding of Psalm <b>8</b>:5. If Psalm <b>8</b> compares our rank to <u>God’s</u>,
it would not relate to the question about our place in the chain of being
insofar as that concept provides a background for the idea that our purpose was
to replace fallen angels).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                Second, “little” could be translated “little
while.” Depending on context the adverb </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>βραχύ</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>τι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<i>brachu
ti</i>) means “a little” in the sense of distance (Acts <b>27</b>:28), time
(Acts <b>5</b>:34; cp. LXX Isaiah <b>57</b>:17), or amount (John <b>6</b>:7;
Hebrews <b>13</b>:22). The first two options fit with the context of Hebrews<b>
2</b>, but they yield opposite conclusions about the comparative rank of people
and angels. In favor of “a little while” is the fact that Christ’s incarnation
made him lower than the angels during that time; previously he was above them,
as argued in Hebrews <b>1</b>. In favor of “little” is the fact that the
original Psalm discusses mankind rather than mankind represented by the Son in
mankind’s role as caretaker of creation. In his substitutionary role the Son
might himself be “a little while lower” without implying that people in their
own order and role are a little while lower until people rise above the angels.</span></p>

Jewish apocalyptic literature and in modern interpretation, “sons of God” in
Genesis <b>6</b>:1-4 has often been taken to mean angels who cohabited with
women. Jude says there were angels that did not keep their principality and
proper habitation, and the 2 Peter <b>2</b>:4 parallel mentions angels who were
cast down just before it refers to the flood (<b>2</b>:5). Genesis <b>6</b>:1-4
introduces the flood account; so the New Testament references may refer to the
Genesis incident with the implication that “sons of God” would mean angels. If
that represents the correct understanding of these texts, Genesis <b>6</b>
provides an example of attempting to breach God’s intended pattern of
continuity of kind. Among several other proposals we tend to prefer Meredith
Kline’s view, however, that “sons of God” is a term for ancient tyrannical
kings (<i>Westminster Theological Journal,</i> Vol. 24 (l962), pp. 187-204); in
that case the passage does not apply to our subject.</span></p>

brought the Israelites out of Egypt, he did not command sacrifices to get them

mean that Jeremiah was criticizing the sacrificial system as a later
development in Israel’s religious history. Jeremiah did not object, however, to
animal sacrifices as such because he recognized their legitimacy elsewhere in
his writing (<b>17</b>:24-27; <b>31</b>:14; <b>33</b>:10-11, 17-22). He supported
Josiah’s reform, which included the restoration of Passover observance (2
Chronicles <b>35</b>:1-9). The phrase in question is relatively infrequent,
appearing elsewhere only in Deuteronomy <b>4</b>:21*; 2 Samuel <b>18</b>:5*; 2
Kings <b>22</b>:13; Psalm<b> 7</b> (heading); and Jeremiah <b>4</b>:21*. The
asterisked references show the distinctive flavor “out of concern for.” Literally
the expression means “on the words of”; so it seems to deal with meaning. Sacrifices
were not instituted for <u>God’s</u> benefit; that is not what they “meant.”</span></p>
