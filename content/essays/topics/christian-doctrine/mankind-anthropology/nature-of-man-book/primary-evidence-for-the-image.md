<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Introduction</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>From evidence presented
in the next three chapters, we conclude that having the image of God means
having interpersonal capacity. At the outset we want to make explicit three
notable ideas in the designation “interpersonal capacity.” <b>(a) </b>Inter<u>personal</u>
means that the image of God has to do with persons instead of things, forces,
animals, or ideas. <b>(b) </b><u>Inter</u>personal relates the image to the
social setting. The image involves more than the individual because it pertains
to marriage, community, church, society, humankind as well as God’s purposes
for persons.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The third point lies in
the word <b>(c)</b> <u>capacity</u>. “Capacity” looks at potential more than
actual. As attitude is more basic than action, so capacity is more basic than
operation. The inner and the potential are the “heart” that the issues of life
come from. We are in God’s image even when we are not actually relating to
another people and when our relating includes impersonal, even sinful, matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Restrictions on the Meaning
of “Image”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Creatable</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Certain guidelines
should be in place before we look for a meaning for the image of God. First,
whatever “image of God” means it must refer to something that can be created. Already
that is a significant gain because interpreters often include an ethical
dimension in the image of Genesis <b>1</b>:26-28. The limitation “creatable”
applies because holiness is a characteristic of behavior, not being. Substance
can be created; action cannot. In deterministic settings we might speak
figuratively about creating an action by creating something that must act in a
certain way. Human reason and will, however, eliminate a one-for-one relationship
between our being and our behavior. An ethical quality cannot be created even
indirectly. The very idea of ethics has no relevance to situations that exclude
reason and will. Determinism contradicts not only our sense of what personhood
is, but the Christian understanding of mankind in general.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1 </span>Another difficulty with including
an ethical dimension in the image is that it runs counter to the next
observation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Applicable to mankind after the Fall</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Image indicates
something mankind has despite the Fall. In recommissioning the human race after
the flood, God commanded capital punishment for murder <i>“because [God] made people
in God’s image” </i>(Genesis <b>9</b>:6). In 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7 Paul
generalizes that a human person <i>“is the image and glory of God.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> In a broader context, James<b> 3</b>:9
highlights the inconsistency between using the tongue to bless God and curse people,
<i>“who are made after God’s likeness.”</i><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>3</span> Not only is he speaking after the Fall, but he does not
condone cursing people who have lost the “ethical” image. Having the image is
not something we can avoid because we are all members of the human race. Sin
did not destroy the image in our first parents, nor does it remove the image in
subsequent persons when they sin personally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

level</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The image of God
applies at the individual level as 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7 declares<i>, “A
man ought not have his head covered because he is the image and glory of God.” </i>Adam
had the image before Eve was created from him. Image-likeness terminology
describes Seth in Genesis <b>5</b>:3, <i>“Adam . . . became the father of a son
in his own likeness after his image.”</i> Applicable to individual people
brings another gain because it means that the image does not directly describe
some group level of mankind—the human race, the family, or marriage. Applying
the image at the individual level also relates to the following observation
that image connects with each of us as a whole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Image texts say either
that mankind is <u>in</u> (and <u>after</u>) the image-likeness of God (Genesis
<b>1</b>:26- 27; <b>5</b>:1-3; <b>9</b>:6) or that mankind <u>is</u> the image
of God (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7; James <b>3</b>:9). They do not say that the
image of God is <u>in</u> man. The latter phrasing might suggest that image
applies at too detailed a level within a person. Genesis does not say God
created Adam in God’s image in some respect. <u>Mankind</u> was in the image of
God; he did not have some trait that God also has. The image does not consist
of rationality or some other human distinctive that is less than everything personhood
is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

accompanies image terminology. When something is “like” something else, the
whole entity can be in view including the unshared characteristics harmoniously
connected; otherwise, the two things would be “the same,” not “alike.” Our
likeness to God involves both shared and indirectly the unshared
characteristics. More importantly, this observation combines with wholeness to
indicate that even the unshared components connect with the image—as in the
functionality of the whole. Image must be creatable likeness to God that
connects to the whole individual even after the Fall. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The interpersonal
purpose of mankind implies interpersonal capacity in mankind. The <u>purpose</u>
of anything determines its nature and design. Likewise, the purpose of mankind
establishes the nature and design of mankind. The reason God made us determines
the way God made us. Similarly, the <u>origin</u> of anything determines its
nature and meaning: “Your ‘roots’ define you.” God created us in his own image
and that makes all the difference. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this case the
situation is not so much that nature determines use or purpose, but <i>vice
versa</i>. If something already exists, what it is like determines what it can
do and what someone can do with it. In God’s case, his purposes arise from his
nature because he is eternal; his nature is already in place before anything
else He that alone has no beginning determines his own purpose by what he is. We,
however, were created by another with a beginning that manifested the purpose
of the creating Other. As Paul said in a different connection, <i>“By the <u>grace</u>
of God I am what I am”</i> (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:10). What we are comes from
the “grace” of another. But when God said, <i>“I am what I am,”</i> he made a
statement about himself as ultimate reality.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>4</span> Because we have a beginning through him by creation, our
nature communicates his purposes, which are interpersonal. From the beginning, scripture
associates interpersonal purposes with God’s image. The purposes that imply
interpersonal capacity cause us to identify that capacity with God’s image in
us. We come <u>from God</u> by <u>creation</u> in the <u>image of God</u>: purpose,
origin, nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>He created us for
fellowship and function, relationship to him and responsibility toward him, to
walk with him and be stewards. So he created us with capacities for relating
and being responsible. Both fellowship and responsibility imply interpersonal
capacities, fellowship because it implies likeness to the “Other” and
responsibility because it requires abilities that fulfill purpose. The <u>responsibility</u>
implied by “dominion” stands in association with God’s image (Genesis <b>1</b>:26-28;
cp. Psalm <b>8</b>). Mankind was to till the ground (Genesis<b> 2</b>:5), and
dress and keep the Garden (<b>2</b>:15). Christ gave the Great Commission to people
who were to call other people back into fellowship with God (Matthew <b>28</b>:19-20,
<i>etc</i>.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Interpersonal capacity
is involved in the different covenants God has made with mankind. Covenant
again combines <u>responsibility and fellowship</u>. As far back as Genesis <b>2</b>,
God’s covenant name Yahveh appears in the account of establishing mankind’s
relationship to the plant world (<b>2</b>:4-17), the animal world (<b>2</b>:19-20),
and the human world (<b>2</b>:18, 21-25). Later came the rainbow covenant (<b>9</b>:1-17),
the Abrahamic covenant, the Mosaic covenant, and so forth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Fellowship</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> with God is shown in the terminology used for his
people—sons of God, friends of God—in his communicating with us, and in having his
tabernacle with us (Revelation <b>21</b>:3). He created us able to love and be
loved. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Fellowship is
existential and stewardship is eschatological. The first has to do with our
present, the second with our future. Together they comprise the <u>primary
dimensions</u> of interpersonal existence. They both require personhood and
equally contribute to personal meaningfulness. We are to walk with God, in the
first case, and to multiply his handiwork and grace, in the second. Within that
second case, we are stewards of God’s common grace of creation and his
proffered grace of redemption (1 Corinthians <b>4</b>:1-2; Titus<b> 1</b>:7; 1
Peter <b>4</b>:10). Accordingly, we glorify him by fulfilling the management
and mission mandates; and when we do, we have fellowship with him who meets our
needs (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:6-11). There is interplay between the biggest
dimensions of human experience: relationship and responsibility. The image as
interpersonal capacity harmonizes these aspects of human existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonality as our
distinctive nature ties into the meaning of “God’s image” because Genesis uses
that expression to characterize us. We infer that the image is the
interpersonal capacity when we reason from interpersonal <u>purpose</u> to
interpersonal <u>nature</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

image</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We can also reason from
God’s interpersonal nature to our interpersonal nature who are created in his
image. Scripture’s most programmatic statement about our nature is that he
created us in his image. What we know about <u>humanity</u> from any source
seems natural to associate with the image terminology, especially those items
scripture mentions alongside that wording. It is natural as well to associate
with it what we know about <u>deity</u> from the rest of scripture beyond the
creation texts. If God is interpersonal and humanity is interpersonal, we
expect that capacity to connect with the image. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We need not belabor
here the idea that God is interpersonal. New Testament revelation makes that
abundantly clear, and that understanding belongs within the meaning of “God’s
image” in Genesis. In addition, materials presented under the next heading
highlight certain data in the creation account itself that belong to that
understanding of deity, hence the understanding of humanity and the
understanding of the image-likeness terminology used for humanity. The God of
the Bible has the characteristics and behaviors we associate with personhood. He
has rationality, affection, volition, and self-transcendence. He cares,
communicates, and conducts himself ethically (holiness). We know him as
Father-Son-Spirit. We know from experience and revelation that we also have
those capacities and can do those same behaviors; so we are like God in those
respects. We need only to associate that set of likenesses with the “image”
expression to conclude that it means interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We are now prepared to
reason from specifics in the creation account to the meaning of the <i><u>imago
dei</u></i> expression. The two previous arguments set the expectancy that
human distinctives present in Genesis <b>1-3</b> correlate with the distinctive
description of us used there. The following paragraphs draw attention to four
phenomena that suggest interpersonal capacity as the definition of image. The
thought pattern moves from the particulars of one topic to the overall picture,
back to other particulars of a related topic, to the same overall picture, and
so forth. So far, interpersonalism has accounted for the <u>reasons for
creating mankind</u> and for particulars in <u>God’s nature</u>. Now we argue
that interpersonalism accounts for the particulars associated with “the image
of God” <u>expression</u>. Interpersonalism accounts for an increasing number
of topics associated with mankind. As that number rises, we gain confidence
that the features of personal relationship form the Christian view of
anthropology and establish the Christian worldview. At the same time, our
confidence grows that interpersonalism correctly accounts for each topic we
have already associated with the image. </span></p>

them have dominion over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the cattle,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Plurality in oneness</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The first observation on the image that highlights
the interpersonal character of mankind is the parallelism between <u>us</u> and
<u>them</u>: <i>“Let <u>us</u> make mankind in <u>our</u> image . . . and let <u>them</u>
have dominion . . . .” </i>As “them” shows plurality on the side of the
created, “us” shows plurality on the side of the creator. “Us” creates “them.” <i>“Let
<u>us</u> make man in <u>our</u> image”</i> reflects the interpersonal
character of God himself (cp. <b>3</b>:22; <b>11</b>:7; Isaiah <b>6</b>:8). Even
if Genesis had said simply that God created mankind in his own image, we could
have inferred that “image of God” included interpersonal capacity because
Christianity understands that God is interpersonal. But the creation account makes
that point explicitly by referring to the creator as “us” and “our.” Accordingly,
we take “us” as a reference to <b>(1)</b> <u>the three-person oneness of God</u>
commonly called “trinity.” Except for the four “us” passages that hint at the
triunity in the Old Testament, nothing explicit about it is revealed until we
get to the New Testament.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> From
the New Testament we read trinity back into these relatively ambiguous texts in
the Old.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> “Us” and “our”
presumably refer to God and so to his triunity since no one else has been
mentioned so far in Genesis. The fact that mankind has interpersonal capacity
derives from the interpersonal nature of God who made us in his own image. The
nature of God establishes the nature of man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

mankind in <u>our</u> image” </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>is not a
case of <b>(2)</b> <u>“majestic plural</u>,” we take it, since <b>(a)</b>
farther along in the account<b> 3</b>:22 speaks about “<u>one of</u> us.” “Majestic
plural” refers to the Semitic idiom that uses plural number to indicate great degree—in
this case the greatness of God. Majestic plural is something like the comment, <i>“I
learned a lot,”</i> which may really mean, <i>“I learned something especially
significant to me.”</i> The speaker did not learn “many things,” as the
collective expression “a lot” might imply. Plural number means high degree
(importance). There could be no speaking about “one of” such a plurality: <i>“Adam
has become like one of us.”</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Besides, with majestic
plural <b>(b) </b>the parallelism would be lost between <u>us</u> and <u>them</u>.
“Us” would really be singular while “them&quot; would be plural. The text and
context bring together the plurality-in-oneness of God and the
plurality-in-oneness of mankind, especially the male-female oneness (cp. <b>2</b>:24).
“<u>He</u> created” stresses God’s oneness while “let <u>us</u> make” stresses
his plurality, even as “created <u>him</u>” emphasizes mankind’s oneness while “created
<u>them</u>” emphasizes our plurality. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Finally, <b>(c)</b>
majestic plural in reference to God (<i>Elohim</i>) always uses <u>singular</u>
grammatical elements with it (adjectives, verbs, pronouns), not plural ones
like “us.” The rest of the verbs and pronouns in this context are singular. Since
pronouns with <i>Elohim</i> as their antecedent are everywhere singular, <u>us</u>
here is not a plural form because it refers to <i>Elohim</i> as a majestic
plural, nor is <u>us</u> such a plural because its own verb (“make”) is plural.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>An ancient Jewish
interpretation makes “our image” refer to <b>(3)</b> <u>God and the elements</u>.
Mankind is a combination of what is like God and what is like matter: spirit
and matter. God did not make the universe out of himself so as to be included
in “ús.” Besides, how likely would it be for God to talk <u>to</u> the
elements, the universe, the dust of the ground that he is going to use to
create mankind from (<b>2</b>:7; <b>3</b>:19)? How likely would it be for the
dust to help God make the man? God did not make the universe out of himself so
as to speak of it indirectly as part of himself? With mankind as with animals,
the <u>earth</u> brought forth, and <u>God</u> made (cp. <b>1</b>:24 + 25).                                    </span></p>

11, 20, 22b, 24), or second-person references to fish and birds (<i>“Be
fruitful and multiply . . . ”</i>; <b>1</b>:22a). They are not first-person
references (<i>“Let us”</i>). In the statement of accomplishment, the text says
mankind was made in the image of <u>God</u> and <u>in [God’s] own image</u> (<b>1</b>:27),
not in the image of the earth or God plus the earth or in “their” image. Paul
does make the statement, <i>“As we have borne the image of the earthly, we will
bear the image of the heavenly”</i> (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:49). Although the
terminology is similar to being created in the image of the earth, the
reference is different. Paul is contrasting two <u>stages</u> of human nature,
not two <u>aspects</u> of the same stage, which could then correspond with the
original God-earth aspects of the “our” image.</span></p>

interpretation include the fact that the word translated “God” here is used for

there seems to be no instance where it covers both God and angels at the same

connection with the expression “the angel of Yahveh,” or “the angel of the
Lord.”<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> At the calling of
Moses and the giving of the Law, the Old Testament says <u>God</u> spoke to
Moses (Exodus <b>3</b>:14), but three different New Testament sources associate
the giving of the Law with <u>angels</u>: Stephen (Acts <b>7</b>:38, 53), Paul
(Galatians <b>3</b>:19; cp. <b>1</b>:8 and 2 Cor. <b>11</b>:14), and the writer
of Hebrews (<b>2</b>:2). <i>“The angel of the Lord”</i> may refer to
pre-incarnate appearances of the Son, but more likely it reflects the Semitic
tendency to streamline causal series. What someone does through another he does
himself. In this application of the streamlining idiom, what God does
indirectly through his “messenger” has God’s authority and character behind it.
For all practical purposes, the “ambassador” is an extension of God.<span

obviously indicates that angel is not identical to “Lord.”<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> Though God and angel are related
in these cases, the blurred God-angel distinction raises a question about God <u>or</u>
angel rather than an observation about God <u>and</u> angel. The two are still
distinct. If “us/our” did mean God plus angels, our inference would still stand—that
the image is the interpersonal capacity. But we have no basis for bringing
angels into the picture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

occur at all until Genesis <b>16</b>:7.<span style='position:relative;

the context by virtue of the very term “God,” who said, <i>“Let <u>us</u> . . .

though the Son is not. We learn from the rest of revelation that God is
Father-Son-Spirit and that there is plurality within the triune God, but under
the trinity interpretation an antecedent for “us” does exist in the context as
based on the New Testament’s more complete revelation about God’s nature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

create: <i>“Let <u>us make</u> man in our image.”</i><span style='position:

created (John <b>1</b>:1-3, 10; 1 Corinthians<b> 8</b>:6; Colossians <b>1</b>:16;
Hebrews <b>1</b>:2) and so did the Spirit, although scripture states the Spirit’s
involvement less clearly (Genesis <b>1</b>:2; Psalm <b>104</b>:30?). We have no
statement about angels creating, and we doubt they can do it since creating
from nothing appears to distinguish deity from non-deity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

are said to be created in the image and likeness of <u>God</u>, not only here
but in Genesis <b>5</b>:1;<b> 9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7; and James <b>3</b>:9
(cp. Acts <b>17</b>:28-29). Such phraseology does not occur anywhere for our
likeness to angels. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> The text says that God created man in “<u>his</u> own
image” (<b>1</b>:27), not “<u>their</u> image.” Under the view that “us” means
God plus angels, both would have this “image.” We would expect the presentation
to keep the same frame of reference throughout and to read something like <i>“Elohim
[God or God and the angels] created man in <u>their</u> image.”</i> There is no
way to cover God plus angels with a singular pronoun, but the godhead can be
referred to by singular pronouns, adjectives, and verbs. Besides, as a majestic
plural designation for God, <i>’Elohim</i> translates into Greek in the
singular form <i>theos</i>, which the Septuagint version uses in <b>1</b>:27
and throughout the creation account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

last three considerations make it difficult not to conclude that <b>(e)</b>
polytheism would be pictured in this context if “us” meant God plus angels. The
“angels” would be creating, they would be called “god,” and man—created in the
image of God—would be created in their image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Finally, we doubt that <b>(f)</b>
“let us” is a poetic device for indicating <u>God’s social nature</u> (though a
singular being). The phrase would indicate, not an interpersonal <u>plurality</u>
in the creator, but an interpersonal <u>bent</u> in him. God wants to relate to
other persons. In that case, “let us” would assume poetic usage; <b>2</b>:7
shows that poetic expression does happen in the text: <i>“God breathed into
[Adam’s] nostrils the breath of life.”</i> The whole issue about literary genre
in Genesis <b>1-3</b> can bear on the meaning of “let us.” Items in chapter<b>
3</b> like a snake that talks, a fruit that makes people wise or one that makes
them live forever have been taken as indicators of myth genre, which in turn
reduces the amount of correlation with reality that the interpreter expects to
derive from these chapters. A higher level of figurativeness in the whole
raises the likelihood of higher figurativeness for expressions within the
whole. Regarding Genesis <b>1-3</b> as myth rather than history would increase
the likelihood that some less direct meaning lay in “let us.” However,
historical presentations contain figurative items and myths contain literal
expressions. Therefore, considering this expression poetic would not remove the
whole from the historical literary genre, and considering Genesis <b>1-3</b> as
myth would not remove “let us” from attesting to the interpersonal plurality of
God. The rest of scripture always deals with these chapters as history as far
as man-God and man-woman relationship are concerned.<span style='position:relative;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Although we have argued
against understanding <u>us</u> as a reference to God plus angels or the
material realm or as a poetic expression for interpersonal bent, those views
would still imply that the image of God is interpersonal capacity. The quality
of interpersonal oneness would perhaps be less. Angels, for example, are more
like a group of persons than Father-Son-Spirit or husband-wife is;
consequently, diversity, interdependency, and complementariness would not come
through so decisively in the image. Instead of majestic plural, God and the
elements, God plus angels, or interpersonal bent, “us” most naturally indicates
God in his interpersonal oneness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If arguments for an
interpersonal interpretation of “let us” seem unsatisfactory, we suggest
restructuring the argument. The plurality-in-oneness of God known from the New
Testament applies to God anytime he is mentioned. God is always who he is and
what he is like, and scripture gives harmonious testimony to the subjects it
treats anywhere. If the <u>New</u> Testament teaches God’s
plurality-in-oneness, then the God who said “let us” is a plural-in-one God,
which is especially appropriate to the “us” who created mankind in his own
image. Since interpersonal humanity bears the image of interpersonal deity, we
can identify the image of God with the interpersonal capacity that humanity
also has as known from experience and other scriptures. Both God and mankind
love. Scripture’s most definitive statement about mankind includes God and mankind’s
most distinctive characteristic.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Diversity in oneness</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. A second observation on the image that highlights
man’s interpersonal character is the correlation between “us” and “male-female.”
In this feature of Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27<i> “let <u>us</u> make man in <u>our</u>
image”</i> and <i>“in the image of God he created <u>him</u>,”</i> on the one
hand, parallel <i>“<u>male and female</u> he created <u>them</u>,” </i>on the
other. The image evidently relates in some way—indirectly, formally, or
analogously—to the male-female nature of humankind. The image harmonizes with
bisexual interpersonalism. Since God is spirit (John <b>4</b>:24), physicality
and sexuality <i>per se</i> are not the point. We can say that the
plurality-in-oneness of marriage is <u>analogous to</u> the
plurality-in-oneness of trinity, not <u>the same as</u> or <u>included in</u>. “Same
as” would lapse back into what ancient paganism portrayed in its male and
female deities. “Included in” would picture deity as somehow a combination of
male and female traits.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>15</span> God
transcends the masculine-feminine differential because he is spirit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Marriage is comparable
to trinity in that <b>(a)</b> marriage provides the most intense, permanent,
all-inclusive interpersonal relationship in human experience. Marriage has the
character it does primarily because in it mankind most distinctively
demonstrates the intense, permanent, all-inclusive oneness of the godhead. As a
total identification, marriage simply intensifies what in principle exists in
all other forms and circumstances of interpersonal relationship. It involves
common purpose, shared values, and all the facets of both persons’ lives. To
put it otherwise, marriage is first of all interpersonal; then the physical
distinctives overlay that reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Analogy to marriage and
the godhead also lies in the fact that <b>(b) </b>male-female unity epitomizes
interpersonalism across diversity (Genesis <b>2</b>:24). The image is not just
unity-in-plurality; it is unity-in-diversity. Beyond transaction and
interaction in a plurality of individuals, diversity leads to
complementariness, interdependency, hierarchy, compenetration, and overlapping
capacities. Paul uses the body figure to illustrate characteristics like these
in the church setting (Romans <b>12</b>:4-8; 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:4-30;
Ephesians <b>4</b>:4, 15-16; cp.<b> 1</b>:22-23; Colossians <b>2</b>:19). Within
both the human and divine, there are differences between the individuals who comprise
the categories—differences perhaps in talents, interests, statuses, and roles
that combine to form the whole and unite to achieve the goal. The work of the
Father, Son, and Spirit stresses the initiating, creating, sustaining,
redeeming, sanctifying functions in their combined operation. Likewise, within
their very constitutions male and female are diversely gifted for fellowship,
for multiplying and subduing the earth, for fulfilling the mission mandate. Diversity
in <u>inborn talents</u> leads to diversity in <u>developed skills</u> and perhaps
to diversity in <u>supernatural gifts</u> for varying roles. What is
particularly true <u>between</u> male-female is true also between persons
within the <u>same</u> “mode” of the image, male or female.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Genesis <b>1-3</b> pictures God in direct
relationship with our first parents. He walked with them in the Garden prior to
their sin. There was direct communication on a periodic basis (<b>3</b>:1-10). When
Cain sinned, he went out from the presence of God (<b>4</b>:16). Before Eve was
formed, God said that it was not good that the man should be alone (<b>2</b>:18).
In contrast, Genesis <b>1</b> describes the final situation and calls it “very
good” (<b>1</b>:31). Being alone is “not good” or “not as good as” for what is
constituted as relational being.</span></p>

observed that we were to take responsibility for the earth and everything in
it. From this fact we later deduced our first argument for the image of God as
interpersonal capacity. In our present effort, we need only to draw attention
to that point and note that it is a part of the information that leads to
identifying that capacity as the image. Immediately connected with the
statement about creating us in the image of God, we received this general <u>commission</u>
as a responsibility (<b>1</b>:26-28). More specifically, God commanded us to
till the ground and dress the Garden <b>(2</b>:5 + <b>3</b>:22; <b>2</b>:16). Responsibility
and accountability are interpersonal phenomena. Since the Genesis text
associates them with image terminology, they argue for the image as
interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>. In a less decisive way, image terminology relates to
<u>covenant</u> in Genesis <b>9</b>:1-7. After God destroyed the human race, he
made a covenant with Noah’s family and his descendants that he would never
again kill mankind with a universal flood. We were not to kill fellowman
because we are in God’s image (<b>9</b>:6). An agreement with promises and
conditions takes place between persons and serves as a guide for their
interaction. Inbuilt natural “law” can govern impersonal reality, but persons covenant
with one another. Personal behaviors like trust and love accompany such
arrangements between those who are in the image of God.</span></p>

prohibitions, God put Adam and Eve in a “morality matrix.” They <u>were to</u>
exercise dominion over the plant and animal kingdoms (<b>1</b>:26-30; <b>2</b>:5-9).
They <u>were not to</u> eat from the “tree of knowledge.” Morality and ethics
address interpersonal circumstances because they have to do with values and purposes,
which persons are not externally compelled or internally programmed to do. A
person can choose to apply or not apply a principle of interaction with another
person relative to some purpose.        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

of knowledge corresponds with <b>(a)</b> the principle of <u>free will</u>,
which can transgress the boundaries of restriction set by “revelation.” Adam
and Eve used free will to disobey God’s injunction not to eat from the tree of
knowledge. That contrasts with the tree of life, which corresponds with <b>(b)</b>
the principle of “intervention” to determine a boundary that cannot be crossed
(<u>external compulsion</u>). After their sin, God intervened to block their
doing what they had the ability to do: eating from the tree of life. <b>(c)</b>
“Creation” sets an even wider limitation through <u>internal ability</u>. Ethics
does not apply to the last two categories because people cannot cross the lines
of restriction in either case. But people can choose to cross over limitations
imposed by revelation; so receiving revelation puts them in the morality
matrix.</span></p>

disobedience in the Garden. Being self-conscious is a function of conscience
that relates to people’s unique characteristic of blushing. Along with
self-consciousness, the <u>sense</u> of guilt is largely an interpersonal
phenomenon, which Adam and Eve reflect in hiding from God after they sinned
(Genesis <b>3</b>:7-8). From the subjective side, they distanced themselves
from God. From the objective side, they were removed from the Garden where they
had previously “walked” with God (<b>3</b>:8; cp.<b> 5</b>:21; <b>6</b>:9; <b>17</b>:1;
<b>24</b>:40; <b>48</b>:15). Going out from God’s presence (<b>3</b>:8; cp. <b>4</b>:16)
is a spatial separation that results from an interpersonal separation, which in
turn results from “un-ethical” behavior. Going out from the Garden was one of
several punishments Adam and Eve received for wanting to become more “like” God
than he wanted them to be (<b>3</b>:16-19, 22-24). A sense of guilt and
punishment for guilt are both interpersonal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

which is part and parcel of what it means to be a person. Therefore, moral
requirements and punishment for failure in them imply interpersonal capacity. The
commandments for what Adam was supposed to do occur in connection with the
image terminology. The failure to refrain from what he was not supposed to do
occurs in connection with “likeness” to God. So, ethical being relates
interpersonal capacity to image and likeness; the specific abilities that make
inter-personhood possible are the same ones that make ethics possible. That
fact lies behind using the natural image as a designation for the ethical
image: “image of God.”</span></p>

personality can suffice to override our better judgment. In short, a man’s
ability to be tempted by beauty and pride relates to his social nature. In
Genesis this temptation took place through the same medium God used for
positive influence on Adam and Eve. Communication is interwoven with
responsibility, ethical expectancy, and social relationship to form a cluster

make mankind in our image after our likeness.” </i>Traditionally they have
highlighted four aspects of the “image.” Reason has headed the list. The
capacity for abstract thought is probably the most distinctive thing about the
human race; so people naturally correlate it with the image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Will</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The will frees persons to choose <u>between</u>
alternatives, not just to respond to a <u>given</u> alternative. People are not
limited to a stimulus-response existence where response is determined by the
most intense stimulus in the environment. Will relates to choice and therefore
purpose, and implies something about motives and motivation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Conscience</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. People can feel guilty, which feeling naked pictures
(Genesis <b>3</b>:7-11). Conscience ties persons to values and emotions. The
pangs of conscience often do not bother us unless someone faces us with our
failure to live up to shared standards. Conscience responds to the <u>person</u>
who gave the commandment or the <u>person</u> with whom we breach a shared
value. Conscience responds to a face. Consequently, guilt indicated by a
bothered conscience results from two relational factors: (1) the lack of
correlation between behavior and a standard for behavior plus (2) the lack of
correlation between one person’s behavior and other persons’ expectancy who
share those values.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Conscience is not
itself a standard of performance but a capacity for sensing inconsistency
between standard and performance, or more exactly, between expected standard
and actual performance. Conscience operates on ingrained, more than inborn,
values. It is educated by social experience. It does not function relative to
items not known, not knowable, or not agreed to. People’s conscience can begin
to bother them later about an action they did not know or believe was bad when they
did it. The ability to feel guilty retroactively is especially personal. People
can even feel guilty about something in front of someone they love and respect
even though they themselves do not think it is wrong. These experiences show
that conscience and guilt are not just in reference to abstract interpersonal
values. They are more interpersonal (real) than that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Affection</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Emotion distinguishes people from much of the
created realm because they care, have feelings and emotions, experiences
affection for other persons. They can love and be loved, which offers a point
of contact for personal bonding between individuals. The ability to <u>be</u>
loved makes it possible even to retrieve people whose sin has separated them
from other people. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Man has a <u>spirit</u>—an incorruptible part that
continues after the body dies. Traditionally, mankind has been regarded as
created in God’s image because he has rational, volitional, ethical, emotional,
and spiritual capacities. In various combinations these simple capacities help
make the complex interpersonal capacity possible and create the complex
abilities discussed below.</span></p>

in humankind derives especially from reason and will. Reason lies behind
imagination to “create” what is not there yet. Satan appealed to this capacity
when he tempted Eve with the prospects of being wise like God. Mind altered
values in this case. The ability to think abstractly relates to language
communication, creativity, self-transcendence, self-awareness,
self-objectification, responsibility, even humor. People can penetrate a
situation in thought and imagination. Will enables them to respond differently from
what the personal influences and physical stimuli around them urge. People are
much less determined than the inorganic, plant, and animal kingdoms. Some of
these derived capacities we can look at in more detail.</span></p>

feature between mankind and the rest of “this creation” is the ability to carry
on word communication based on symbolic thought. People are not “dumb brutes.” Animals
can do what might be called “communication,” but they do not communicate
through language systems.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>56</span> Their
communication is genetically based and transmitted and operates in
stimulus-response fashion. Human language, however, is rationally based and <u>culturally
transmitted</u>. It is a function of a culture, <u>specialized</u> to the
interests, needs, characteristics, and perceptions of a given society. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Human language is <u>hierarchically
structured</u> in that it has levels—sounds (phonemes) that grammar relates
together (morphemes) to create words; groupings of words to make phrases,
clauses, sentences, and the like (tagmemes). Language has “deep structure,”
which corresponds to the categories of formal analysis based on rational
categories. Animal communication has one “level,” and there is no grammar
between parts. Its elements do not form a “system” of interdependent phonemes,
morphemes, and tagmemes. Instead, there is a set group of separate items. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Human language is <u>arbitrary</u>
since there is no necessary connection between the linguistic item and what it
refers to, which is partially what we mean when we say that language is “symbolic.”
By “dancing,” bees tell other bees where a source of nectar is located. The
bees’ flight movements are “iconic”; they indicate direction and distance like
a map in the air. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Human language is <u>imaginative</u>
in that it is not based on external reality itself but on the speaker’s
subjective conceptualization of that reality. People can lie (contradictory to
reality), talk about unicorns (contrary to reality), and communicate things of
the past, the future, the distant, the unperceivable—things that require “trust”
for the hearer to come to know about and believe (displaced reality). Either by
place, time, or perception, there is separation between the speaker/hearer and
the topic of conversation.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>17</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

in the sense that it generates new words, sounds, and combinations; it evolves.
In this way, whole new language systems emerge and hundreds of such systems
currently exist in flux. Animal language is static rather than dynamic. All
members of the same species use the same sounds for the same “meaning,” and new
systems do not emerge. The distinctiveness of human language is one of the most
important indicators of our uniqueness from animal, which correlates
significantly with being in the image of God.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The rationality that leads to self-transcendence,
self-awareness, self-objectification, imagination, and the like, operate in the
social setting, where morality plays out. Social existence and therefore the
ethical situation require the ability to project consciousness over behind the
eyes of other people to determine how best to ought to act toward them. Only in
the social circumstance can the self define itself as a self. Conscious
self-awareness arises from interaction with other selves. Long ago George
Herbert Mead observed that self emerges when a person can take the role of the “generalized
other” and look back on the self.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>18</span> The
Golden Rule assumes this mechanism made possible by reason in conjunction with

which depends largely on feedback from other people. As interpersonal capacity
enables us to relate to them, relating to them comes back to us in a way that
we are not only aware of ourselves as selves, but we make inferences about our
worth as implied by the way other persons treat us. Experiencing self-image is
distinctively personal. It starts with interpersonal capacity and moves through
other persons back to us to produce a value judgment about ourselves.</span></p>

decision. What people consider beautiful may change over time within culture,

more than something pleasant to the senses, which are based in genetics. Aesthetics

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Since God created mankind
in his own image, the task of identifying the image consists of comparing the
biblical teaching about God and mankind and integrating it with confirmatory
evidence from human experience. <u>Restrictive guidelines</u> for understanding
“the image of God” include the fact that it is creatable, applicable to mankind
after the Fall, applicable at the level of the whole individual, related to the
social setting, and inclusive of even the unshared characteristics between God
and mankind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The first <u>positive
approach</u> to the meaning of image is the fact that purpose determines
nature. (1) Arguments for the interpersonal purpose of mankind likewise argue
for mankind’s interpersonal nature. Since being created in the image of God is
scripture’s most generalized statement about human nature and since those
purposes are stated in conjunction with image terminology, we identify the
image with interpersonal capacity. Furthermore, (2) since God himself is
interpersonal, being created in his image means having interpersonal capacity. Finally,
(3) several specifics in the context of image terminology also add up to
interpersonal capacity: relationship (“let us”), responsibility (“dominion”),
ethical behavior (“forbidden fruit”), and language communication. Primary
capacities like rationality, affection, will, conscience, and spirit serve as “aspects
of the image” that enable persons to function in these interpersonal ways. What
distinguishes us from animals constitutes the image of God in us.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Part of the reason people include an ethical dimension
in the image itself is Paul’s later use of the expression in an ethical sense. Restoring
the image (cp. Romans<b> 8</b>:29) implies that it was previously not there. That
further implies that it was lost at some point because we had the image
originally. The inference is then made that the image was lost to some degree
in the Fall. But that is a <u>second</u>, or adapted, usage of <u>image</u>,
not a usage that highlights an ethical dimension always present in it. Paul’s
usage of ethical image is not <u>in series</u> with the natural image of
Genesis <b>1-3</b>, but <u>in parallel</u> with it; that is, he uses natural “image”
to picture ethical character, a particularly deft stroke because the natural makes
the ethical possible. The image in Paul’s sense is lost when each individual “falls”
by sinning. “Creating” a “new man” uses the historical beginning of mankind as
a picture of a new ethical beginning of him. Creation, resurrection, new birth,
and metamorphosis are all “natur-al” images for spiritual change. </span></p>

implies distinctions within the godhead. Genesis <b>19</b>:24 says, for
example, <i>“Yahveh rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahveh
out of heaven.”</i> This instance may simply represent Semitic parallelism or
tautology. Deity is associated with <u>Messiah</u> in some texts. The Son who
has the eternal government on his shoulders is called “Mighty God” (Isaiah<b> 9</b>:6-7).
In Jeremiah <b>23</b>:5-6 Messiah is named <i>“Yahveh our righteousness.”</i> Less
clearly Psalm <b>110</b>:1 says, <i>“Yahveh said to my Lord . . . ”</i> (cp.
Matthew <b>22</b>:41-46; Mark <b>12</b>:35-37; Luke <b>20</b>:41-44; note
Benjamin B. Warfield’s article “The Divine Messiah in the Old Testament” in the
1916 <i>Princeton Theological Review</i>). The <u>angel of the Lord</u>
phenomena (noted below in footnote 8) also associates deity with certain
theophanies (Genesis <b>16</b>:10, 13; <b>22</b>:11-16; <b>31</b>:11, 13;
Exodus <b>3</b>:2, 4; Joshua<b> 5</b>:13-15; <b>6</b>:2; Zechariah <b>1</b>:10-13;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>For our part, we think that many of these
passages describing “theophanies,” that is, manifestations of deity <i>per se</i>,
are really cases of God’s speaking through angelic mediation (see following
footnote). <i>“The angel of the Lord” spoke </i>to Moses in the burning bush
(Exodus <b>3</b>:2); yet the succeeding account (and Deuteronomy <b>33</b>:16;
note context) repeatedly says that <u>God</u> was speaking to Moses (<b>3</b>:4,
6, 7, 14, <i>etc</i>.). Since Yahveh who spoke in the bush is Yahveh who gave
the Law, the giving of the Law is said to be through angels (Hebrews <b>2</b>:2-3)
in a New Testament context that makes them lower than the Son, who is the
effulgence of divine glory and the substance of deity (Hebrews <b>1</b>:1-<b>2</b>:1).
In this one case at least, the Hebrew writer’s distinction between the Son and
angels disallows the angel of the Lord at the burning bush to be a
pre-incarnate theophany of the Son. In another example, the New Testament
identifies Malachi <b>3</b>:1a (<i>“I will send my messenger, and he will
prepare the way before me”</i>) with John the Baptist (Matthew <b>11</b>:10,
14; Mark <b>1</b>:2; Luke <b>7</b>:27). Malachi <b>3</b>:1b-6 does predict the
incarnation; but since it is a prediction, it is not a pre-incarnate theophany
but the future incarnation itself. Other angel-of-the-Lord texts are ambiguous.
The most likely theophanies are those in italicized references at the beginning
of this note.</span></p>

has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father?’” </i>In the
succeeding context, however, Jesus talks about going to the Father (<b>14</b>:12,
28), praying to the Father (<b>14</b>:16), being sent by the Father (<b>14</b>:24),
having the Father send the Spirit in Jesus’ name (<b>14</b>:26), and being

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The different conclusions regarding the mythological <i>vs.</i>
strictly historical genres for the first chapters of Genesis have been argued
by critical scholars for three centuries or more. The intensified
creationist-evolutionist controversy since the mid-l960’s has occasioned the
production of a vast literature on the myth-history debate as exemplified on
one side by Conrad Hyers in<i> The Meaning of Creation: Genesis and Modern
Science </i>(Atlanta, GA: John Knox Press,1984) in contrast to writings on the
other side by Henry Morris, John Whitcomb, Duane Gish, and others associated
with the Creation Research Society.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>An example of the attempt to <u>combine</u> male and
female traits appears in the contemporary notion of “the eternal feminine” and
the insistence on “inclusive language” relative to deity. Deity is neither male
nor female nor both; deity is without reference to sexuality physically or
psychologically; deity is asexual. The uniform use of masculine pronouns and
images for God in the Bible derive from functional analogies, not ontic
realities.</span></p>

language and animal communication systems, see Charles F. Hockett, <i>A Course
in Modern Linguistics</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1958), chapter 64; or “Animal ‘Languages’
and Human Language” in <i>The Evolution of Man’s Capacity for Culture</i>, ed.
by J. N. Spuhler (Detroit, Mich.: Wayne State University Press, 1959), pp.
32-39. Among more recent publications the book by John C. Condon, Jr. can
introduce the subject: <i>Semantics and Communication</i> (New York: Macmillan,
l985. 3rd ed.), particularly pp. 8-14. At a more technical level, see Noam
Chomsky, <i>Aspects of the Theory of Syntax</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: The M. I. T.
Press, l965); pp. 64-106 discuss “Aspects of Deep Structure.” Robert A. Hall’s <i>Introductory
Linguistics</i> (Philadelphia, PA: Chilton Books, l964) is a good general
introduction to the study of human language. At a somewhat less technical level,
see <i>The Language Gap </i>by Clifford A. Wilson and Donald W. McKeon with an appreciative
response by Marvin K. Mayers (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House,
1984) or <i>Monkeys Will Never Talk . . . or Will They?</i> (San Diego: CA: Master
Books, 1978) by Clifford A. Wilson. More general works of importance include
Benjamin Lee Whorf, <i>Language, Thought and Reality</i>; Edward Sapir, <i>Language:
An Introduction to the Study of Speech</i>; Susanne K Langer, <i>Philosophy in
a New Key: A Study in the Symbolism of Reason, Rite, and Art</i> (New York: The
New American Library of World Literature, 1942); Benjamin Lee Whorf and Edward
Sapir, <i>Hypotheses</i>; Church, <i>Language and the Discovery of Reality</i>
(New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., l921); Ernst Cassirer, <i>An Essay on Man: An
Introduction to the Philosophy of Human Culture </i>(Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday,
1953).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>In contrasting human language and animal
communication, Cassirer discusses displacement under the terms <u>symbol</u>
and <u>signal</u> (<i>Essay on Man</i><u>,</u> pp. 41-62). Symbolic “represents”
while signal “announces.” A signal has a one-for-one association with the
referent while symbol can vary in both connotation and denotation depending on
shifting contexts. Symbolic stands for something in the absence of; signal
points to something in the presence of. The former represents one thing by
something else; the latter directs thought and leads to response, which is the
mechanism behind operant conditioning. Researchers can train animals to perform
certain operations to obtain food, pleasurable experience, or tangible consequence.
