<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We have not made a
distinction between “image” and “likeness,” even though Genesis <b>1</b>:26
uses two words to compare mankind and God. <b>(a)</b> Nothing in the context
distinguishes them. Furthermore, <b>(b) </b>in most other passages only one
term occurs, <i>image</i> in Genesis <b>9</b>:6-7; 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7;
James <b>3</b>:9 and <i>likeness</i> in Genesis <b>5</b>:2 in an otherwise
word-for-word parallel to <b>1</b>:26. <i>Like</i> in Genesis <b>3</b>:5, 22
translates a different item than in <b>1</b>:26.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span>           </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(c)</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> The safer interpretation follows the principle of
minimum affirmation. The number of terms does not necessarily correspond to the
number of realities because terms can overlap or offer two word-pictures for
the same thing. That can be for emphasis or for enriching the perception of the
item. In English we may say “various and sundry” as a way of stressing “various.”
Hebrew idiom is more inclined toward such “redundancy and tautology” than
English is. Loose language appears in this setting because the similarity
between God and man is not so exact as that between man and man (Genesis <b>1</b>:26;
<b>5</b>:1-3). Similarly, Paul says that Jesus was <i>“found in the likeness of
man”</i> (Philippians <b>2</b>:7). The Son was fully human, but we do not reverse
the situation and say that mankind is fully God; yet “likeness” describes the
comparison between them. Terminology is not always constant as we have seen in
the ontic <i>vs.</i> ethical uses of <u>image</u> in the Old Testament <i>vs</i>.
the New. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpretation should keep
the burden of proof on the affirmative. Effective thought avoids proposing a
viewpoint and then seeing how much information fits it. Some proposed
distinctions can be disproved (<u>restrictive</u>), but others cannot (<u>neutral</u>).
An interpretation should have a <u>positive</u> basis. It is not correct
because it cannot be disproved because sufficient information is lacking. In
this case, what disallows falsification also disallows verification. In the
image-likeness discussion, some distinctions may even be <u>factually accurate</u>
in themselves without being meant by “image” <i>vs</i>. “likeness.” Being able
to imagine even an <u>appropriate</u> distinction does not mean the author had that
in mind. Distinguishing “image” and “likeness” requires finding intended
difference in the meaning of <u>terms</u>, not finding an apt distinction in
the real nature of mankind itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Accordingly, <b>(d)</b>
we do not gain anything apparently by distinguishing image and likeness in
Genesis <b>1</b>:26. Whatever we correlate with the terms here is true, if it
is, because of whatever suggested the distinction in the first place—direct
statements elsewhere in scripture, correct inference from experience, or proper
understanding of God’s and man’s nature, relationship, and purposes.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpreters have set
forward a number of distinctions. <b>(1)</b> Image equals the cluster of <u>simple
capacities</u>—reason, will, affection, conscience, spirit—while likeness
equals the <u>complex capacities</u>—communication, responsibility, love, and
the like. <b>(2) </b>Image equals <u>capacity</u> while likeness equals <u>possibility</u>,
that is, what is given and what is attainable with what is given. This approach
would fit with Satan’s temptation that Eve would become “like God” (<b>3</b>:5)
and with their becoming “like one of us” in “knowing good and evil” by eating
the forbidden fruit (<b>3</b>:22).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It has also been
customary to correlate <b>(3) </b>image and likeness with <u>being and behavior</u>,
anticipating the Old<b> </b>Testament <i>vs.</i> the New Testament use of <i>image</i>.
The close relationship between human nature and human ethical behavior has
prompted interpreters to relate ethics to the image, not as a capacity but in
terminology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Behavior cannot be
created, however; so ethical quality cannot be created since it comes from a
kind of behavior. Likeness to God in an ethical sense is not what can be <u>given</u>
by creation, but what is <u>done</u> with what is given. Similarly, behavior
and ethical quality cannot be physically begotten; yet Genesis <b>5</b>:3 uses
this same set of terms to describe Adam’s begetting Seth <i>“in his own
likeness after his image.”</i> So, it does not work to say that man cannot
create behavior, but God can. Adam and God both can originate whatever these
terms designate, Adam by begetting and God by creating. Furthermore, likeness
and image in the New Testament are both used in ontic and active senses.                                      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Another image-likeness
distinction might be <b>(4) </b><u>same <i>vs.</i> similar aspects</u>.<b> </b><u>Image</u>
would cover the elements we share with God while <u>likeness</u> would cover
those analogous to him. Rationality, affection, and will would be examples of
image, while sexual variance, upright gait, living longer than animals would be
examples of likeness. Again, however, the fact that the same terms apply to
Adam-Seth serves as a control case that eliminates this suggestion for
God-Adam. In other settings, <u>image</u> can refer to a statue of a man
(Ezekiel <b>16</b>:17; Daniel <b>3</b>:1, <i>etc</i>.); yet a statue includes
aspects beyond the criterial characteristics shared with the person represented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A related possibility
is that image and likeness refer to <b>(5)</b> <u>interpersonal capacity <i>per
se</i> <i>vs</i>. the responsibility manifestation of that capacity</u>.<b> </b>Image
as created interpersonal capacity would then contrast with dominion, or
responsibility, as appointed role. There is some plausibility in this
suggestion. Even though dominion is not a <u>creatable</u> likeness, it is an <u>appointable</u>
likeness. Image would address nature, and likeness would address role. God has
nature and position. The word “make” (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-size:14.0pt'>עשׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>) is general enough to cover both
creation and appointment (1 Samuel <b>12</b>:6; 1 Kings <b>12</b>:31; cp.
Jeremiah <b>12</b>:6). In <b>1</b>:26 <i>make</i> governs both <i>image</i> and
<i>likeness</i>; but in <b>1</b>:27, which uses “create” (</span><span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt'>בָּרָא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span dir=LTR></span>, <i>bara’</i></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> = <b>1</b>:1, 16, 21; <b>2</b>:3, 4),<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> the verb governs only <u>image</u>.
The commission in <b>1</b>:27 could be a replacement for <i>likeness</i>—multiplying,
filling the earth, and exercising dominion over it. Also, in chapter<b> 3</b>:5,
22 becoming like God might mean determining for oneself what is good and evil. It
would be exercising autonomy to the exclusion of higher control, which is a
prerogative of deity alone. In effect, becoming like God would be a denial of <u>appointed</u>
responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Another way of
distinguishing image and likeness may be that <b>(6) </b><u>image has
connotations about man’s wholeness in comparison to God whereas likeness
individuates the aspects within the whole</u> and implies that differences
exist between mankind and God even while emphasizing shared characteristics. Such
distinctions might be connotations resident in the normal use of the words
themselves rather than in anything observed in Genesis itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(7) </span></b><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Image</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> might
indicate only what is the <u>same</u> between mankind and God while <u>likeness</u>
would be a broader word that includes human distinctives relative to God, but
there is no contextual cue for such an intended distinction between <u>image</u>
and <u>likeness</u>. Another suggested distinction might be that <b>(8)</b> <i>image</i>
strikes at mankind’s likeness to God at the level of the whole, whereas <i>likeness</i>
draws attention to the similarity or similarities between the two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It appears more
reasonable to suppose that <b>(9) </b>no intended difference corresponds with
the words. Minimum affirmation suggests that we not strain to define
distinctions where we have no way to verify them. The two nouns in Genesis <b>1</b>:26
emphasize one truth under two word pictures: we share likeness to God, which we
have understood as interpersonal capacity. </span></p>

that <u>idea</u> with <b>1</b>:26, however, could add lure or irony to Satan’s
temptation. In the one case, the force of it becomes <i>“if you really want to
be like God, eat the fruit.”</i> The other tack would make it ironic: <i>“If
you want to be like God, eat the </i>fruit [of course, you already have
likeness to God in any way that is legitimate for you to have it]<i>.”</i> Mankind
created in God’s “likeness” (</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<i>bara’</i>) means “create,” not so much from
nothing as in “built” something new. It can apply to cases where something new
is made from previously existing matter. God “created” Israel when he
constituted the Israelites as a nation at the crossing of the Red Sea (Isaiah <b>43</b>:1,
15; 1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:1-2).</span></p>
