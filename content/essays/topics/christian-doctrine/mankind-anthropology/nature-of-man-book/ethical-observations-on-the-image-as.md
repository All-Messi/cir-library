.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1) <u>The image as
interpersonal capacity connects the natural and the ethical usages of the
expression <i>image of God</i></u>. One pervasive concern of biblical content
is wholeness, the big picture, the synthetic emphasis in contrast to a
dichotomistic, analytical, reductionist approach. That concern carries over
into the terminology. The penchant for integration accounts for the rather
facile <u>shifting back and forth</u> between natural, behavioral, and
relational usages of terms like image, life, sin, flesh, create, knowledge, and
wisdom associated with the creation narrative. Integration accounts for places
where such expressions may <u>combine</u> these rather different, though
related, concepts when dealing with subjects in broad scope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Image</span></i><span

<b>5</b>:1; <b>9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7; and James <b>3</b>:9. Paul
uses <i>image</i> in an ethical sense in Romans <b>8</b>:29;<span

Colossians <b>3</b>:10.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2, 3</span> Not
only were we created in the image of God <u>as to nature</u>; we are commanded
to be like him <u>as to behavior</u>.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> Ethics
and morality apply only to interpersonal circumstances. The natural image is
interpersonal capacity; the ethical image is proper interpersonal behavior made
possible by that interpersonal capacity. The extended use of <u>image</u> for
ethical character confirms our understanding that its natural use means
interpersonal capacity, because that capacity makes ethics possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Substantive terminology
for behavioral realities represents typical linguistic usage. It occurs in all
languages including modern English and biblical languages. <u>Image</u> as a
term for ethical likeness to God parallels the use of “divine nature” in 2
Peter <b>1</b>:4. In a context about virtue, Peter declares that obtaining the
divine nature reverses the corruption that lust has brought into the world. The
kind of result matches the kind of cause. Corruption from lust is then a
behavioral corruption rather than an ontic one. Escaping behavioral corruption means
a coming to partake of the ethical divine nature. Therefore, “nature” refers
not to substance/hypostasis/being, but to character/behavior. The passage has
nothing to do with becoming deity by, say, moving up the “chain of being”
through evolution, reincarnation, or Gnostic progression.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> Likewise, Peter is not talking
about miraculously “reconditioning” a creatable nature given in the beginning
but lost to some degree during the Fall of Adam. It is a renewed “nature,” not
in substance but in kind of person. Peter speaks about behavior (<b>1</b>:5-8)
and relationship (<b>1</b>:10-11), issues pertinent to salvation as
reconciliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1 John<b> 3</b>:2-4
says that when Christ is manifested, we will be like him. John does not mean we
will become deity, but that we will be able to <u>see</u> him as he is. Becoming
spiritual beings and obtaining the glorified body satisfies that hope.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> Seeing him as he is at his return
may not even require translation into spiritual beings because every eye will
see him (Matthew <b>24</b>:30; Revelation <b>1</b>:7). Being <u>like</u> him
may represent ethical usage as in 2 Peter; but if John had more in mind, his
words do not have to mean becoming like Christ as to deity. We are already in
his likeness without being divine. Being like him at his coming need not
indicate more than an increased similarity with God.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2) <u>The image as
interpersonal capacity makes a natural connection with Christ as the ethical
image and likeness of God for us</u>. Whereas the natural image is retained
when people fall, the ideal ethical image is lost by sin and able to be restored
through grace in Christ, who is the image of God (2 Corinthians <b>4</b>:4; cp.
Colossians <b>1</b>:15).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> Paul
sprinkles creation terminology throughout his comments on salvation and
sanctification: creation, image, likeness, knowledge, wisdom. Because none of
us behaves completely like God in expressing the interpersonal capacity, Christ
came to redeem us from being sinners to <i>“put on the new man that is being
renewed to <u>knowledge</u> after the <u>image</u>”</i> of the creator
(Colossians<b> 3</b>:10). We are <i>“<u>created</u> in Christ Jesus for good
works”</i> (Ephesians <b>2</b>:10). From Jews and Gentiles, Christ <i>“<u>created</u>
in himself”</i> a new united mankind (<b>2</b>:15). We <i>“put on the new man
that has been created <u>according to God</u></i> [= likeness?] <i>in
righteousness and holiness of the truth”</i> (<b>4</b>:24; cp. Colossians <b>2</b>:10).
Image as interpersonal capacity makes it natural for Paul to adapt <i>image</i>
for the ethical character that comes from such a capacity and to label Christ
as God’s ideal Man with whom we can identify for being considered righteous
like him.</span></p>

interpersonal capacity sets the framework for ethics</u>. Morality and ethics address
person-on-person activities, not person to thing and thing to thing. The
diagram below organizes the dimensions of its two main aspects: <u>existential</u>
and <u>eschatological</u>. <i>Existential </i>refers to the present experience,
including relationships <u>vertically</u> with God (A-1), <u>horizontally</u>
with other people (A-2), and <u>internally</u> between the inner and outer self—spirit
and flesh (A-3). Eschatology refers to the forward movement of existential life
from purposes to goals. Primary ethical principles address these two dimensions
of life.</span></p>

our being</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> is the most primary ethical
principle (Matthew <b>22</b>:34-38; Mark <b>12</b>:28-30; Luke <b>10</b>:25-28a).
Love is principled behavior for the lasting joy of others; so it is more than a
feeling; it is (a) an act of the will in carrying out (b) a pattern of behavior
characterized by self-giving for the glory of God. If we love him, we will do
what he says (John <b>14</b>:23, 15) and not feel “put upon” (1 John<b> 5</b>:3).
</span></p>

Commandment/Royal Law [A-2] </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Golden Rule governs
relationships between people: <u>treating other people the way we want to be
treated</u> (Matthew <b>7</b>:12). That restates the Second Great Commandment
to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (Matthew <b>22</b>:39-40; Mark <b>10</b>:31;
Luke <b>10</b>:29b-37; Romans <b>13</b>:8-10; Galatians <b>5</b>:13-14). It
gives at least a “rule-of-thumb” for deciding how one person ought to act
toward another one, and it does so in a positive as well as negative sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(a) Morality is more
than <u>not doing</u> what we would not want done to us. (b) It is <u>doing</u>
what is to someone else’s benefit. Furthermore, (c) it is doing what we would <u>prefer</u>
to have done to us even though not required, and even though not doing it would
not be a sin or make life intolerable (note “seemly” in 1 Corinthians <b>13</b>:5).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Furthermore, (d) the
Golden Rule takes into account the way <u>they</u> want to be treated. It takes
into account the differences between people. So, it is not just a matter of
treating other people the way <u>we</u> want to be treated; it is a matter of
treating them the way we would want to be treated <u>if we were in their shoes</u>.
That ends up meaning we treat them the way they want to be treated. That broad
principle in the Golden Rule/Second Great Commandment is limited, of course, by
the First Great Commandment and by our own integrity as individuals. Treating
other people the way they want to be treated is limited by their own need to
love God and respect us. Love means <u>mutual</u> respect.</span></p>

[A-3]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The priority of
spirit over flesh</span></u><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>governs activity within each person. The predominance
of the inner over the outer is another way of saying the predominance of spirit
over flesh. In 1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:12 Paul says he will<b> </b>not be
brought under the power of anything. The principle he enunciates gives one
reason why it is wrong to do privately what causes physical addictions and
psychological compulsions (“hangups”). Consequently, he goes beyond the notion
of “victimless crimes,” which supposedly impact no one but the doer. Something
is wrong if it puts physical drives and psychological compulsion in ultimate
position on moral matters. Immorality does not apply just to those behaviors
that can be measured quantitatively relative to physical and social consequences;
it applies also to what brings psychological bondage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Asserting the supremacy
of spirit over flesh does not argue for doing what is most healthful because the
body is the Spirit’s temple (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:19). What harms the body can
take second place to the interpersonal considerations implicit in A-1, A-2, and
B-1. Some foods are less healthful than others; yet Jesus cleansed all meats
(Mark <b>7</b>:19), so dietary laws no longer belong to <u>religious</u>
concern as in ethical considerations. <i>“Cleansing all meats”</i> does not
change the <u>scientific</u> facts about healthful foods at least for some
people. The body as the Spirit’s temple does argue for the <u>moral</u> need to
avoid eating what may cause heart conditions, cancer, high cholesterol, <i>etc.</i>
Paul’s positive approach to ethics centers on addictiveness, which eliminates
prioritizing spirit over flesh. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The body as the residence
of the spirit (not Holy Spirit) requires using the body in a way that puts
spirit over flesh.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> Having the
interpersonal capacity means living by values more than drives. Unlike animals we
do not have only behaviors based largely in genetics but based voluntarily in
ideals. Our actions are not determined just by heredity conditioned by
environment; they are determined by decision and learned through influence. Ethics
is a human possibility because it is more than an elaborate determinism subject
to science.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ethics involves more
than conforming behavior to an external standard. It calls for a righteousness
that <i>“exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees”</i> (Matthew <b>5</b>:20).
It addresses heart and motive as well as action that other people can evaluate.
It means positive decisions based in the internal impulses (Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34).
The personal-interpersonal capacity supplies the primary principles for ethical
theory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The principle of spirit
over flesh connects ethics with nature. Nature sets potential behaviors rather
than specific acts as moral. The high variability in humankind means ethical
behavior ties rather loosely to nature. Yet certain actions are not optimum for
the interpersonal capacity—our distinctive characteristic in “this creation.” Living
by the “lower nature” alone does not bring satisfaction; it does not bring “life.”
We do not live by bread alone, but by values that address the higher nature,
which enables us to relate to God and other persons (Deuteronomy <b>8</b>:3;
Matthew<b> 4</b>:4; Luke <b>4</b>:4) and to fulfill purpose in those
relationships. Failure to live by the higher nature leaves us with
psychological emptiness even if it does no physical damage. Psychological
emptiness and stress can lead to physical problems because we each one are a
psychosomatic whole. Since living by the lower nature amounts to individualism,
it has social repercussions like those Paul lists in Galatians <b>5</b>:19-21. Inasmuch
as these do not make for love, joy, peace, and other spiritual fruits, they
dimmish the quality of life and in the extreme can even destroy it. In an
indirect way, then, scientific research can address ethics if it is sensitive
to more than physical consequences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Because nature includes
more than our physical nature, being “contrary to nature” applies not only to
what causes physical maladies, but to what causes psychological ones. For this
reason especially, there are a few cases where scripture, using a negative
ethical principle based on nature, labels certain behaviors as evil because
they are against nature. Paul does this with <u>homosexual behavior</u> in
Romans <b>1</b>:26-27. He does a similar thing in 1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:18
when he says that fornication is a unique sin against a person’s own body. He apparently
means that <u>fornication</u> destroys a person’s sense of identity, or
wholeness, with his wife, and therefore his own self-definition. In regard to <u>hair
length</u>, Paul asks the Corinthians, <i>“Does not even nature teach you that
if a man has long hair it is a dishonor to him?” </i>(1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:14).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span> But being different from nature
is a negative principle, not a universal one, because Paul observes that
uncircumcision is according to nature (Romans<b> 2</b>:27).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The one-to-many
splice</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Ethics not only needs to
address individual behavior and social behavior; it needs to describe the
boundary between individual freedom and social responsibility. <u>Individual
freedom ends where other individuals’ freedom begins</u>. Most of the
supposedly “victimless crimes” do not in reality affect just the person who
does them, because people’s lives are so intertwined that the behavior of one
ends up impacting others. Similarly, private acts between “consenting adults”
are matters of morality because the repercussions of private acts end up
costing society money, effort, time, and grief. They also depersonalize the
other consenting adult and prioritize flesh over spirit. <u>Our individual
actions must leave us able to be responsible for ourselves</u>. What we do is
immoral if it makes us unable to function appropriately in relationships and
purposes (note B-1).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the horizontal
dimension, the best ethical principle is for each person to act consciously as
a model for others. That is what happens in good teaching and particularly in
effective parenting. People grow best when they are helping other people grow. Going
at ethics this way gets away from individualism, pleasure orientation, and unconscious
living. It takes care of weaker-brother situation as well.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> Edifying others combines with
glorifying God to produce sanctifying of the self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

good and bad are also measured relative to purpose</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. In behavior, the ultimate issue is not whether
something is legal under a temporal or divine standard, but whether it is
effective. Abiding principles applicable in all cases are relative to the
standing purposes of God and man. Obviously, since we are dependent beings, we
cannot define our own ultimate purpose. The purpose measurement for ethics is
first God’s purpose, after which we work out our self-chosen purposes. In that
framework, God allows us considerable freedom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Right and wrong focus
on motives and attitudes more than on acts taken by themselves. The same act
can be good or bad depending on why we do it and on our attitude toward other
people when we do it. A normally good act becomes evil if done out of selfish
motives or with a depersonalizing attitude. In interpersonal activity, intentionality
counts for something important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Morality includes not
only what is or is not <u>wrong</u>, but what relates to what is <u>wise</u>. Wisdom
brings in practical considerations. Some things may not break any of God’s
abiding principles of behavior, but it is normally not wise to put ourselves in
certain situations. What is possible is not necessarily what is smart because we
may not, for instance, be as strong as we think we are. Standing outside the
force field of the situation, we may suppose we can handle more than we can. Not
only does wisdom deal with the doer himself (which applies also in the “one-many
splice” under A-3); it deals with practical effects on other people, as in the
weaker-brother situation. Wisdom addresses what other people prefer, what other
people may easily misread about our motives, and what other people may be led
into doing on the basis of their misreading us. Not only is there <u>commandment</u>
(principle), there is <u>advice</u> (wisdom) And where there is neither
commandment nor advice, <u>love</u> and <u>expediency</u> reign. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
existential-eschatological splice</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. As
there is a connection in the existential aspect between the individual and the
group, so also there is a connection between existential and eschatological. <u>Right
and wrong are measured relative to purpose as qualified by love</u>. Latitude
and longitude (the existential and the eschatological) combine in ethical
choices. <u>Ethics prioritizes purpose over pleasure</u>—spiritual over
material—because purposes are chosen relative to values not wholly rooted in
material considerations, but also in interpersonal ones (love). Spiritual and
interpersonal are closely related if not identified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Consistency</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> provides a summarizing principle for morality whether
it is consistency between behavior and the nature of the situation, between
behavior and purpose, or between behavior and promise. Consistency for God is
between his nature and purposes and between his promises and behavior. Consistency
for us is between our behavior and God’s values and purposes for us. Appropriateness
and consistency involve restricted freedom rather than positive determinism. There
is freedom within a framework; people have personal liberty to do that fits the
circumstances. Consistency does not generate the specific acts, but limits what
specific acts free will should generate. In the context of consistency, <u>love</u>
and <u>expediency</u> provide the positive principles that generate acts in the
vertical and horizontal relationships between persons. Love is holistic because
it combines feelings and principles and unites self and others. There needs to
be a consistency in love—principled caring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We have differentiated
between the natural and ethical usages of the <u>image </u>terms in scripture—ethical
<i>image</i> appearing only in Paul’s writings. Within the natural usage, we
have identified the image of God with the interpersonal capacity and
distinguished the <u>image itself</u> from its manifestations, modes, and
aspects. The capacity for interpersonal operation leads to the manifestations,
uses, consequences, and extensions of it in fellowship with God, in
responsibilities like dominion and mission, in marriage and the home
especially, and in society generally. Male and female are <u>modes of the image</u>.
Reason, will, affection, conscience, spirit, and the like are <u>aspects of the
image</u>—individual capacities that combine to produce the complex
interpersonal capacity with its modes and manifestations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The natural image
consists of the <u>creatable</u>, <u>shared</u> likeness between us and God. The
image is not just what is common between us and God or distinctive between us
and animal. It does not directly include all characteristics of us or God, nor
does it include them in the same degree. It is not just what is common to all of
us or what is unaltered throughout eternity for each of us. The image does not
have to be grounded in the same thing that it is for God or angels; hence, it
can indirectly include even the physical body, human sexuality, and marriage by
involving them as the ground of the image, the medium for expressing it, or the
means of transferring it from one generation to the next. The image is not an
irreducible something; it exists at the level of the individual in a way that
includes all aspects below that level and functions in parallel and
hierarchical relationship with all other persons of every order of being. Interpersonal
capacity fosters holism, avoids reductionism, and legitimizes diversity and its
potentials. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The image of God
involves in us and God items of the <u>same kind but different degree</u> as
well as items of <u>different kind</u> that are nevertheless compatible with
the shared characteristics. In the first category, belong the image itself as
interpersonal capacity and the components that make interpersonal behavior
possible. We have rationality, volition, affection, conscience, and the like;
but we are not <u>as</u> intelligent, <i>etc</i>., as God himself. In the
second category, belong non-essential variants not shared with God but
operative within the confines of interpersonal capacity: physicality,
sexuality, marriage. Interpersonalism establishes a theology of physicality and
sexuality, and affirms the completeness of single persons of either sex without
projecting sexuality onto deity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The image as
interpersonal capacity is confirmed by its integrative and explanatory power
for a wide range of other phenomena. The first seven of these are <u>natural
observations</u>. The image as interpersonal capacity </span></p>

provides for a <u>holistic understanding of mankind</u> in keeping with the
fact that the text of Genesis says mankind is in the image of God, not that the
image of God is <u>in</u> mankind. Consequently, it avoids the reductionistic,
simplistic, and static picture of man that comes from identifying the image
with something at the “sub-individual” level. Interpersonal holism in the
earthly state </span></p>

connects with incarnation, indwelling, theophanies, anthropomorphisms, <i>etc.</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

the fundamental nature of <u>marriage</u> without implying that unmarried
people lack the image. The interpersonal image </span></p>

clarifies <u>the man-animal distinction</u> by providing a balanced view of
their differences and likenesses. Discovering shared capacities does not
undermine human uniqueness as long as the degree to which animals possess them
is not of the degree or kind to produce interpersonal relationship. Interpersonal
capacity </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (6) makes <u>incarnation</u>
formally a more understandable fact, even though we still cannot specify exact
mechanics and the like. We do not have to resort to some kind of dualism in
order to account for it as in the doctrine of the “two natures.” Finally, it                       (7)
clarifies the <u>deification-glorification distinction</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonal
image also relates to three <u>ethical matters</u>. The first is
terminological. Interpersonal capacity </span></p>

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (8) shows
the propriety of the New Testament ethical usages of the image expression,
because ethical character is an interpersonal consideration. Furthermore, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (9) the New
Testament presents Christ as the image of God and calls on men to identify with
that personal Likeness as a basis for being viewed themselves as having the
ideal ethical image. The consequent possibility is relationship with a holy
God. Interpersonal image </span></p>

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (10) sets
the framework for ethical theory as something applicable only to the
interpersonal domain. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Identifying the image
of God with the interpersonal capacity has several advantages because the
concept is so basic and yet so comprehensive and complex. Because of the
complexity of persons in relationship, interpersonal capacity can incorporate
anything scripturally relevant to the <i>imago dei</i> and everything that has
been associated with it historically. Interpersonal capacity can account for an
extensive and diverse range of items without making us too much like God or <i>vice
versa</i>, which confirms the correctness of identifying the image with the
interpersonal capacity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Image relates to all
three primary categories of reality: <u>being</u>, <u>action</u>, and <u>relationship</u>.
(a) As to being, we have interpersonal capacity. (b) As to action,
interpersonal capacity captures what we <u>can</u> do and <u>should</u> do. (c)
As to relationship, interpersonal capacity is expressed in the male-female
variant, the marriage circumstance, and society as a whole. Image addresses
everything about us in both our existential and eschatological frames of
reference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Righteousness is a
personal-interpersonal consideration. Although it deals with <u>nature</u>, it
deals especially with <u>relationships</u> and <u>purpose</u>. It addresses
what is directly interpersonal, what accompanies the intrapersonal, and what
grows out of the interpersonal (purpose). Righteousness involves <u>internal
attitude</u> (motives) as well as <u>external behavior</u> (actions). Righteousness
is both horizontal (love for people) and vertical (love for God). It means
doing what we can to improve the quality of relationships (positive), not just
to keep them from getting worse (neutral and negative). Being good is not just
a matter of avoiding what is <u>wrong</u>, or <u>un</u>ethical, but of choosing
to do what helps relationships and furthers purposes; it involves more than a <u>legal
standard</u>. Righteousness relates to purpose because persons purpose; they do
so by making choices relative to values and goals more than drives. Righteousness
is interpersonal, not just legal; it involves more than a <u>conceptual
standard</u>. Righteousness is relational, not just <u>natural</u>; it involves
more than what is best for the body—a <u>natural standard</u>. Righteousness is
consistent with the existence of other persons and the future; it is not just
an emotional <u>feeling</u>, a physical <u>drive</u>, or an intuitive <u>impulse</u>.
Righteousness is behavior consistent with the interpersonal situation made
possible by the interpersonal capacity; righteousness is principled love.</span></p>

usage here. He is using creation terminology for reconciliation process. In
Ephesians <b>2</b>:10 he does the same thing when he says that we are <i>“<u>created</u>

Resurrection terminology serves a similar purpose in <b>2</b>:5 and Colossians<b>
2</b>:13: we are <i>“<u>made alive</u> in Christ Jesus.” </i>These are examples
of ontological terminology for relational or behavioral realities, a frequent
phenomenon in language usage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Many interpreters do not recognize that
Paul is using an old term for a new subject to gain a fresh word picture for
it. Instead, they suppose that image includes an ethical dimension even in Old
Testament usage, and suppose that there is a connection between the nature and
ethics usages because nature enables a person to have ethical capacity. In the
Fall a certain degree of that capacity was supposedly lost, which means that it
has to be somewhat restored by Christ through the Spirit before a person can respond
to the gospel and be saved in Christ Jesus. The primary weakness of this
reconstruction is that ethical likeness cannot be created. It must result from
behavior in conformity to a standard. While it is true that there is a capacity
that makes ethical behavior possible, scripture does not say that Adam lost
some of that capacity when he sinned. There is no indication in the creation
account or elsewhere that Adam’s ethical ability after he sinned was any less
than what it was before in an inheritable sense.</span></p>

1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:16-17 features a similar contrast between spirit and
