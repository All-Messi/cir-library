<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the previous chapter
we offered <u>restrictive guidelines</u> for identifying the image of God—boundaries
within which the understanding of image must fall. The image must be a
creatable likeness that applies to the whole individual even after the Fall. Then
we offered two sets of <u>positive evidence</u> for the image as interpersonal
capacity to build the view “from zero.” There were two <u>deductive</u>
arguments: (1) the interpersonal purposes of mankind predict interpersonal
nature of man as the image; (2) being in the image of an interpersonal God
implies that mankind is interpersonal. Finally, we made <u>inductive</u>
observations: human peculiarities observed in connection with image terminology
end up being aspects of interpersonal capacity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Those considerations
offered <u>primary evidence</u>, evidence that requires a certain view. The
next three chapters provide <u>confirmatory evidence</u>, evidence that
reinforces a conclusion reached on other grounds though perhaps not required by
this second kind of evidence itself. Together these latter observations form
one argument: the image as interpersonal capacity connects nicely with a range
of biblical teachings about the nature of man and Christ. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
text-indent:4.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Image
and “Levels” of Man</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The image as
interpersonal capacity appropriately connects with all levels of man</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Interpersonal capacity does not require putting the
image at any “level”—whether individual, “sub-individual,” or corporate. Putting
the image simply at the <u>individual</u> level would not so easily account for
the “us” of the image. Identifying the image with a specific “<u>sub-individual</u>”
aspect of the person would work against a holistic understanding of a human
person, a point elaborated in the next observation. Putting the image at some <u>corporate</u>
level brings in several difficulties. If <u>marriage</u> were the level at
which the image exists, single persons would not have the image, including
Jesus himself. Adam would not have been in the image of God before the Lord
created Eve. Feral children, lone mountaineers, hermits, and the unborn would
not have the image. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If <u>mankind</u> were
the level of the image, it would not exist now because sin has divided mankind
racially, nationally, religiously, <i>etc</i>. Taking away unity removes an
essential characteristic of deity. But alienation does not destroy the image <i>per
se</i> because, as we have observed before, scripture applies image-likeness
terminology to mankind even after sin and its divisive effects had entered the
human race (Genesis [<b>5</b>:1-3] <b>9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7; James
<b>3</b>:9; cp. Acts <b>17</b>:28-29). The image resides in the individual, but
it involves all aspects of man in his relationship to other persons. By
speaking of the image as interpersonal capacity, we avoid some difficulties
present in other proposals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is appropriate that
our view of the image not be limited to any level. The individual-corporate
distinction in humanity is not absolute. The individual man Adam was the one
from whom God made Eve; so the <u>man-marriage distinction</u> is diminished by
the fact that the first wife was taken from the first husband. Besides, each
individual person is marriage<u>able</u>. The <u>man-mankind distinction</u> is
also not absolute because all mankind has descended from that same first pair. Paul
combines these observations to highlight male-female interdependency: woman was
created from the man, and man is given birth by the woman (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:8,
12).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> These factors establish
in mankind an intimacy potential for reflecting the <i>imago dei</i> that
angels do not have since they were presumably created individually and
directly. They are united by common values, common purposes, and hierarchical
arrangement, but not by their manner of origin or any possibility of
propagation. Interpersonal capacity is not equated with any particular aspect
or manifestation of that capacity. Capacity draws attention to what is
potential in man more than what is actual in him. <u>Manner of origin</u>
(history) and <u>manner of propagation</u> reflect the <u>image</u> (nature)
even as nature reflects <u>purpose</u> and <u>values</u> reflect both. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Image and Wholeness</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2) <u>The image as
interpersonal capacity provides for a holistic understanding of man</u>. On the
positive side, the previous chapter noted that mankind was created in the image
of God. Genesis does not say that the image of God is <u>in</u> man. On the
negative side, there are several disadvantages to identifying the image with a
sub-individual level. First, <b>(a) </b>identifying the image with rationality
or volition is not exegetical. Such identifications lack direct bases in the <i>imago
dei</i> texts themselves. The interpreter is not drawing the meaning for image
out of the text first and then correlating it with experience or other
scriptures. He starts with correlation between the biblical expression and
human experience—the experience of human rationality, for example, in contrast
to the observed lack of it in other physical creations. Whenever possible,
exegesis from a text should precede correlation with other texts or with
experience. If nothing in the “near context” explains a point of interest, we
do have to look at the “distant context” in the rest of special revelation and
at “the nature of the case” inferred from experience to see what &quot;fits
with” the issue at hand. Such cases involve a “correspondence” approach to
interpretation, which says “this is that” (cp. Acts <b>2</b>:16; Ephesians <b>4</b>:9-10;
Matthew <b>11</b>:14; John <b>1</b>:45-46), rather than an inductive approach. But
the correspondence approach increases the likelihood of error and irrelevance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Ideally,
interpretation should follow a pattern of induction, deduction, integration. In
our own method, we have tried to begin exegetically, then make inferences, and
then generalize and integrate with other particulars to arrive at an
understanding of the <i>imago dei</i> that harmonizes with the rest of the
Christian worldview. So, we have taken the image to be man’s interpersonal
capacity in a worldview that centers on interpersonalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>An exegetical approach
here produces a holistic and functional understanding of the image more than an
analytical and static one. Traditional proposals about the image of God offer
some significant insights into man’s nature, but Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27
suggests the larger and more basic truth we have identified with
interpersonalism. Reason, will, conscience, affection, and spirit do belong to
the subject, not because individually any one of them is the image, but because
they combine to make the image possible. They make interpersonalism possible. They
are capacities necessary for behaving interpersonally; consequently, we may
call them “aspects of the image,” not the image itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Besides lacking
contextual foundation in Genesis, another disadvantage to identifying the image
with, say, rationality or volition is that the approach is <b>(b)</b> <u>reductionistic</u>,
which does not fit the nature of the case. People are actually more than mind,
will, conscience, emotion, or spirit. They are a combination of these and more.
The <i>imago dei </i>of Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27 evidently includes at least all
the creatable characteristics common to God and man. The limitation “creatable”
obviously applies because holiness derives from behavior not being. Substance
can be created, but action cannot. Perhaps by a figure of speech in
deterministic settings we could speak of creating an action. We could say that
someone created an action by creating something that had to act a certain way. Precisely
because mankind has rationality and volition, however, there cannot be a
one-for-one relationship between his being and behavior; so behavioral
qualities in people cannot be created indirectly by creating a substance that
would necessitate holiness. Necessitated holiness would in fact be a
contradiction of terms, an oxymoron.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Our wholeness extends
to characteristics we do not share with God (physicality, sexuality,
corruptibility, and the like),<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> but
there is no reason to exclude any <u>shared</u> likenesses at least and no harm
in including them as sub-parts. As with most things, people are not one
irreducible something from which everything else “unpacks.” Philosophically
that would be “foundationalism” in contrast to “combinationalism.” In the
latter case the thinker <u>starts</u> with a item and frame of reference that
is comprised of more primary elements.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span> Reason, affection, and the like are individual capacities
that form a gestalt, that is, a whole that is more than the sum of such parts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A third disadvantage to
identifying the image with rationality, <i>etc.</i>, is that it is <b>(c) </b><u>simplistic</u>.
It fosters a faculty psychology comparable to “bean-bag genetics.”<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> It proceeds as if a person were a
series of parts that individually produced identifiable phenomena like
conscience, will, affection, thought, and so forth (reification). The
complexity level is too low for what we need to describe. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A fourth disadvantage
is that it is <b>(d) </b><u>analytical and static</u> rather than synthetic and
dynamic. Conceiving of the image as rationality plus volition plus conscience
plus affection . . . fragments the person. It loses the gestalt that a human
person is. The whole of mankind is more than the sum of its parts even if all
the parts are taken into account. In a real whole, there are factors beyond
sheer number. There are qualitative features like unity, interaction,
hierarchy, compenetration, and beauty. So to speak, several individual genes
contribute to one capacity, and one gene connects with several capacities (next
¶). Identifying the image with interpersonal capacity avoids <u>reducing</u>
persons to one essence or <u>fragmenting</u> them into a series of parts
conceived of in static terms. It fosters functional wholeness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Holism can exist
without having to keep forever in the image everything mankind now is. Such is
the case because the same effect can arise from more than one “basis.” God and
angels can be interpersonal as spirit beings (John <b>4</b>:24; Hebrews <b>1</b>:14;
Luke<b> 24</b>:39) and humans can be interpersonal on physical bases. Brain may
be able to produce mind epiphenomenally, but mind may not have to come from
brain or “reside on” brain. Theologically the concern is practical effect more
than ontic cause and analysis. Because we have in our thinking an <u>omnipotent</u>
God with ultimate <u>authority</u>, we can believe that God is <u>free</u> to
will that mind exist on some other basis besides brain or on no basis at all. He
<u>can</u> transform the physical into what is not physical and “re-connect”
mind, for example, with a “new body,” as in resurrection, translation,
transubstantiation, re-creation, or some other form of “miracle,” that is, by something
that does not derive from the natural order. What he has done or will do in
these connections cannot be known, and yet it is ours to know that we are in
his image; consequently, the image of God in man is something we can know in a
functional sense even though our understanding does not include unknowable
factors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We are concerned about
holism because scripture presents mankind holistically. It speaks of the <u>redemption</u>
of the whole person. Although a part of us dies, resurrection (or translation)
remedies even that loss. We do not become less than persons when we die. <u>Individual
statements of scripture</u> make the flesh part of us, as Paul implies in
Romans <b>7</b>:18: <i>“I know that nothing good resides in me, that is, in my
flesh.”</i> In the context Paul bemoans the warring that goes on in his
members. He is both part of them (<b>7</b>:18) and above them (<b>7</b>:20); so
the mind/spirit/transcendent nature should predominate, but it includes that
over which it predominates instead of being parallel to it. The biblical
picture of mankind does not suggest “dualism” because the higher and lower
natures are not set in contrast or put in parallel but arranged in hierarchy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Holism could put too
much in the image while honoring God’s image could work against holism. The
image as interpersonal capacity avoids these extremes by establishing a context
that can incorporate everything in people and their relationships at least
indirectly. That interpersonal context qualifies every aspect of our being,
behavior, and relationship which manifest that capacity. Flesh becomes
interpersonal flesh; sexuality becomes interpersonal sexuality; marriage
becomes interpersonal intimacy. Although such factors may not be inherently
necessary to the image, they are included in its operation for now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Image and the Body</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(3) <u>The image as
interpersonal capacity establishes our attitude toward the physical body</u>. God
created mankind in his own image in the physical state (Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27),
blessed them (<b>1</b>:28), and pronounced them very good in that state (<b>1</b>:31);
the physical body is part of that state. In the biblical view, the material
realm relates to the spiritual realm as positive to positive (<b>1</b>:10, 12,
18, 21, 25; cp. <b>1</b>:22, 28; <b>9</b>:1; cp. Psalm <b>104</b>:28; <b>119</b>:
68), not as negative to positive. The human body then relates to the human
spirit positively. The lower nature does not relate to the higher as negative
to positive. Since the material realm came by creation from the spiritual realm
that preceded it, matter is <u>not parallel</u> to spirit and <u>not opposed</u>
to it, but <u>positively secondary</u> to it and <u>functionally incorporated</u>
under it. The material <u>manifests</u> the spiritual (Psalm <b>19</b>:1) and
serves as an <u>instrument</u> for accomplishing the purposes of the spiritual.
Likewise, the human body is not parallel to the human spirit or opposed to it,
but positively secondary to it.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> The
body manifests the spirit and serves to accomplish its purposes. As a result,
the image as interpersonal capacity sets people’s attitude toward themselves in
the physical state as persons in fellowship, not as animals in herds or
chemicals in clusters. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Characteristics of the
relationship between spiritual and material realms in general establish
guidelines for understanding the spiritual and material aspects of mankind
particularly. There have been three general approaches to the body relative to
the spirit. (a) The body is evil, and the spirit is good (Stoicism,
Epicureanism, gnosticism, Manichaeism) or a poor imitation of the “idea-l”
(Platonism). The body is “the prison house of the soul.” These are
negative-to-positive views. (b) The body is amoral, and the spirit does not
exist (materialism). The physical realm is all there is. (c) The spirit is
dominant and body subordinate (Christian). Scripture implies this last
viewpoint since a good God created matter including the human body and made it
an aspect of the same mankind he commissioned to take care of other matter God
created. The doctrine of creation and the fact of commission establish the
positive character of the material universe, all the parts that comprise it,
and what can be done with it. In our physical humanness we can have fellowship
with a holy God and can participate in the responsibilities such a God gives us.
A positive attitude toward the physical body fits with the positive attitude
toward physicality in general. The biblical religion does not teach that matter
is evil; consequently, the material body is not evil. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Positive attitude
toward the body corresponds with an ethic that uses the physical body for
spiritual ends. The behavioral implication is that we not <u>satiate</u> the
body as in hedonism (cp. Philippians<b> 3</b>:19), <u>depreciate</u> it as in
asceticism (cp. Colossians <b>3</b>:23), <u>glorify</u> it as in humanism, but <u>transcend</u>
it. We keep the body in secondary position (1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:27; Romans <b>8</b>:13;
<b>12</b>:1-2), using it as an instrument of activity for good guided by
transcendent values of spirit and mind, and directed especially toward
interpersonal purposes and relationships. The body can be viewed as a <i>temple
of the Spirit</i> (1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:13-19; cp. Mark <b>14</b>:58), as <i>a
vessel for spiritual treasures</i> (1 Thessalonians <b>4</b>:4; cp. Acts <b>9</b>:15;
2 Corinthians <b>4</b>:7; 2 Timothy <b>2</b>:20; 1 Peter <b>3</b>:7), as a
temple and <i>tabernacle of the soul/spirit</i> (2 Corinthians<b> 5</b>:1, 4; 2
Peter <b>1</b>:13-14), as an <i>instrument of righteous</i> for glorifying God
(Romans <b>6</b>:7; 1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:13; Colossians<b> 2</b>:17).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Positive attitude
toward the physical body relates to several other biblical doctrines that
presuppose it. Incarnation, divine indwelling, theophanies, anthropomorphisms,
and creation in the image of God do not degrade deity; they dignify humanity. The
very doctrine of <u>creation</u> itself correlates with the idea that the
creation is in some sense good—or at least not evil (Genesis <b>1</b>:31,<i>
etc</i>.). There is no contradiction between the prohibition against idolatry
and the notion of relating the image to the body if the lower nature and the
higher nature are not parallel parts and if body is subsumed under spirit as
its director. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Physical humanness in
the image allows for <u>incarnation</u> without incarceration or dualism. For
first-century Jewish religious leaders, the offense in Jesus’ claim to deity
probably lay not only in their fear of polytheism, but in their abhorrence for
making God too imminent. They stressed God’s transcendence and the
ineffableness of the divine name to the point that they did not even pronounce
his personal name Yahveh. Even today when they read the Hebrew scriptures
orally, Jewish people say <i>Adonai</i> (“my Lord”) or occasionally <i>Elohim</i>
(“God”) in the place of the tetragrammeton (Yahveh). The New Testament writers
did not challenge this hypersensitivity as is shown by their regular use of <i>kyrios</i>
(“Lord”) in their references to deity. For Jews, incarnation made God too
imminent. But if interpersonal capacity capsulizes the shared nature of God and
man, then Jesus Christ was not an artificial mixture of deity and humanity, and
his deity was not imprisoned in a body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Later Judaism had
difficulty with <u>anthropomorphisms</u>, expressions that assign human
characteristics to what is not human. Old Testament scripture, however, is
replete with phraseology about God’s hands, right hand, fingers, eyes, ears. It
freely speaks of him as “getting up early,” even “being grieved.”<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> Semitic idiom used body parts
symbolically for psychological, abstract, and intangible realities; and in
scripture it did so even with God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Physical humanness in
the image allows for the concept of <u>indwelling</u>. Indwelling pictures the
body as a temple for the Spirit rather than a prison. Indwelling means at least
that the transforming influence of God fully permeates to the inner character
of the human self, from which springs the issues of life. Whether the
indwelling is strictly locational or simply pictured as locational,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6 </span>the implication remains that God’s
being with us and in us (John <b>14</b>:17) does not grate on spiritual
sensitivities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Physical humanness in
the image allows for <u>physical death</u> without losing the higher nature and
<u>physical life</u> without tainting it. Scripture never says we lose the
image when we die, and obviously we have it while we live. The image does not
require any circumstance of its manifestation. The body manifests the human
person in much the same way as the incarnation manifested the second person of
the trinity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Positive attitude
toward the body allows for <u>resurrection</u> of the body (both Christ’s and
ours), not just immortality of the soul. Resurrection was foolishness to Gentiles
(<b>17</b>:31-32, 18; cp. 1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:23)<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>7</span> because they typically believed in a dualism that
depreciated matter or made it evil. Resurrection of the body as distinguished
from immortality of the soul affirms the dignity of physical humanness and the
fundamental meaningfulness of life in this present condition. Even though we do
not know exactly what resurrection is, it must be more than immortality of the
soul. In resurrection, there is at least <u>re-identification</u> with the
material realm and the kind of physical body we have now. Obviously,
resurrection is more than the resuscitation of a dead corpse because
metamorphosis, transformation, transfiguration occurs even for those alive at
Christ’s coming (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:50-54). That <u>transformation</u>
evidently involves the change to asexual being since there is no marriage in
the resurrection (Matthew <b>22</b>:30). But resurrection and transformation
both involve <u>continuity</u> between the earthly, physical body and the
spiritual, heavenly one (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:42-54).</span></p>

interpersonal capacity provides the theological foundation for interpreting
sexuality</u>. It implies a positive view of sexuality, affirms the equal worth
of both sexes (Galatians <b>3</b>:28), and defines the proper relationship
between them (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:13-20). Sexuality represents a variable
within the image since both sexes have interpersonal capacity and equally so. This
variance is subsumed under the larger truth of the divine image common to both
and expressed in the union of the two (Genesis <b>2</b>:24). Sexuality along
with the physicality of which it is a part, is a non-essential part of human
wholeness. What is variable is not essential, and we have concluded that the
essence of image is interpersonal capacity. That is a little different from
defining what is the essence of humanness since interpersonal capacity applies
to a range of created and uncreated kinds. Since in the resurrection marriage
does not take place (Matthew <b>22</b>:29-30), we infer that sexuality does not
continue; yet in the resurrection humans evidently do not cease to be human nor
in God’s image. Therefore, on this side of death-resurrection, sexuality does
not constitute a basis for valuing one mode of the image over the other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:7
bears some comment if male and female are non-essential variants within the
image. Speaking about the propriety of women/wives not wearing a veil while
praying or prophesying in public, Paul says, <i>“A man [husband?] should not
uncover his head, being the image and glory of God; but the woman [wife?] is
the glory of the man [husband?].”</i> He gives as reasons for his verdict the
fact that in the beginning woman was made from man and for man (<b>11</b>:8-9;
Genesis <b>2</b>:21-23 + 20, “helpmeet”) and “because of the angels,” an
ambiguous reference he does not explain. The veil is an “authority” on her head
(<b>7</b>:10). Scripture associates two other issues with the image of God. Man
should not be <u>murdered</u> (Genesis <b>9</b>:6) or <u>cursed</u> (James <b>3</b>:9-10)
because he is in the image of God, and a man should not <u>wear a veil</u> (1
Corinthians <b>11</b>:7) for the same reason. The parallel, however, between
the first two and the last is only apparent because the meaning of <u>man</u>
shifts from “mankind” to “male.” Something must explain this meaning shift
because Paul bases his comments on the same Old Testament image terminology as
is present in the prohibitions against murder and cursing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The issue for the present
is what it means to say that the man is the image and glory of God in a context
that contrasts man and woman. Does Paul mean that women are <u>not</u> in the
image of God, <u>less</u> in the image of God, or <u>indirectly</u> in the
image of God. That woman is <b>(a)</b> <u>not </u>in the image cannot be the
point since other scriptures use image (in the natural<i> vs</i>. ethical
sense) indiscriminately of mankind. Genesis <b>9</b>:6 does not mean that if
someone killed a <u>woman</u> capital punishment would not apply. James <b>3</b>:9
does not mean to imply that it is okay to curse a <u>woman</u> but not a man. The
original creation proposal itself presents male-female as a variant within mankind,
the image of God. Elsewhere Paul himself teaches that at some level in Christ
the male-female distinction is no more relevant than the bond-free or
Jew-Gentile distinction (Galatians <b>3</b>:28). That level would seemingly
have to be high enough to include interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The second option—that
woman is <b>(b) </b><u>less</u> in the image of God than man is—does not sound
likely unless Paul makes an unmarked shift in what “image” includes. We have
understood image-likeness as terminology about human nature, which then has
several consequences and manifestations. In this format, interpersonal capacity
(the image itself) leads to dominion, <i>etc.</i> (consequences of the image);
nature <u>leads to</u> responsibility. Paul, however, may be thinking of the
image as covering the broader spectrum. If so, he <u>combines</u> nature and
responsibility (dominion). This latter arrangement fits with the idea that the
man’s responsibility is more ultimate than the woman’s without exalting males
or debasing females. Especially if Paul is using <i>“image and glory of God”</i>
as a reference to responsibility as well as nature and if he is thinking of the
sequence of man and woman’s creation, then he may be identifying the image more
directly with the man because he considers man’s responsibility more ultimate
than woman’s as reflected in the creation sequence. Paul could then relate that
to the contemporary practical issue of veil-wearing as a woman’s cultural
symbol for acknowledging before God and other people the authority that
reinforces a man’s more ultimate responsibility. <i>“Because of the angels”</i>
might then refer to God’s rejection of angels who did not keep <u>their</u> proper
principality (Jude 6; 2 Peter <b>2</b>:4). Paul would be bringing them in as a
reminder of what happens when people try to take over things not appointed to
them or to act in ways that are not appropriate to the manner of carrying forward
the privileges and responsibilities that God <u>has</u> given them. Since woman
was created from man, she is <b>(c) </b><u>more indirectly</u> in the image
from a history and responsibility standpoint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Physicality, sexuality,
procreation are evidently at least related to, analogous to, governed by, or
exhibitive of, the <i>imago dei</i> since scripture makes the same connection termwise
between Adam and Seth as between God and Adam. <i>“In the day that God created
man, he made him in the likeness of God; he created them male and female. . . .
Adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begot a son in his own likeness,
after his image”</i> (Genesis <b>5</b>:1-3; cp. <b>1</b>:26-27); Luke’s
genealogy of Jesus concludes with <i>“. . . Enos, (the son) of Seth, (the son)
of Adam, (the son) of God” </i>(<b>3</b>:38). Paul is even willing to call mankind
<i>“</i>[God’s] <i>offspring </i>[</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>γένος</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>genos</i>]<i>” </i>(Acts <b>17</b>:28-29). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Procreation takes place
in all organisms, which reproduce after their kind; so we might be inclined to
separate procreation from image considerations entirely. But the image consists
of more than the peculiarities of man <i>versus</i> animal. More importantly,
the interpersonal image transforms the character of everything in its context,
including reproduction. God intended human sexuality to be interpersonal rather
than purely biological as reflected in the fact that man is unique in being
able to reproduce face to face and in the fact that sex has more than a
reproductive purpose.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> It
involves commitment to common identity, values, and purposes. Hebrew idiom for
sexual intercourse is “knowing,” which represents personal terminology. Besides,
mankind’s uniqueness in face-to-face reproduction reinforces the interpersonal
nature of human sexuality. Relating sexuality to deity through the image in man
does not mean God has sexuality but that man’s sexuality operates as an
expression of interpersonal capacity. It reaffirms interpersonal identity and
has to do with commitment to values and purposes more than drives. The image
logically precedes sexuality; so human and animal reproduction differ in
character.</span></p>

interpersonal capacity establishes the fundamental nature of marriage</u>. One
flesh defines marriage, which leads to multiplying offspring by that union. The
one flesh of marriage manifests a plurality-in-oneness in humanity that
reflects the plurality-in-oneness in deity. Sexual unity between male-female is
an intended physical analogy to the person-to-person relationship between man
and God and more especially between the “us” in deity. Arguing against temple
prostitution, Paul says that being sexually joined to a harlot makes the two
one “body,” which he considers alternative to being joined to the Lord as one “spirit”
(1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:16-17). Sexual union is intimate physical and
psychological identification even as spiritual union is interpersonal
identification. Husband-wife sexual relationship is ultimate intimacy in the
physical realm even as Father-Son-Spirit spiritual relationship is ultimate
intimacy in the interpersonal realm (note John <b>17</b>:20-22). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>God intended
male-female physical unity to be kept within the interpersonal context rather
than being something separate. When sexual activity is made something by itself,
it is reduced to temporary physical pleasure and works against ongoing
psychological identification. Intimacy is missing, and the possibility of
achieving it can be destroyed. Sexual relations were intended to be a union in
the larger context of commitment to values and purposes (ethics) and to each
other (identity). Intercourse is not for the one or for the other partner, and
so Paul teaches that neither the husband nor the wife has final authority over
his or her own body (1 Corinthians<b> 7</b>:2-5). Interpersonal identity leads
to physical intimacy, which establishes and reinforces interpersonal identity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>For this reason, the
New Testament teaches that fornication, adultery, and divorce are sins: they
destroy identity and the sense of identity, and they are unique in the degree
of their doing so (1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:18). Sexual expression has the
guidelines it does because God intended to establish the marriage mode of
intimacy as a reflection of the divine image. That interpersonal purpose of God
to have man in his own image is then reflected in the historical manner of his
bringing man and woman into existence (making one from the other and making one
for one other) and in the manner of having them reach their full number
(procreation). It is reflected in their complementariness (one flesh) and
interdependency (man from the woman plus man by the woman). All New Testament
teaching on men-women relationships stems from the nature of man and woman as
implied by their manner of origin. That is the reason New Testament teaching
refers to Genesis <b>1-3 </b>on every issue associated with sexuality and
men-women relationship in the home, the church, and society. Those issues
include fornication, adultery, divorce, and complementary roles in the home and
in the church (Matthew <b>19</b>:3-12; Mark <b>10</b>:2-12; 1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:12-20;
<b>11</b>:2-16; Ephesians <b>5</b>:22-33; 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:11-15). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Of special importance
regarding marriage is the fact that its interpersonal character precedes its
physical distinctiveness. Not until there is compenetration of personhood can
there naturally be compenetration of physical natures; otherwise, there is loss
of self-image. There is loss of self-esteem both by the “user” and the “used”
(the woman ends up being the one most often “used” in fornication and
adultery). Obviously, the “used” loses self-esteem because he senses in the
other’s behavior a lack of “esteem,” which is another way of saying impersonal
behavior. The “used” is not treated as an equal but as something lower. The way
others treat us is a prime basis for the way we view ourselves. No wonder “love
’em and leave ’em” makes people feel like they are living a “dog’s life.” Even
the “user” is not fulfilled because he does not receive interpersonal response
from the other. “Emptiness” results. Paul probably had such thoughts in mind
when he said that fornication is unique as a sin against the “body.” More than
any other sin fornication strikes at the very sense of who we are, our
identity, our “body” (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:18). Marriage and therefore
sexuality is mutual commitment and common identity before it is pleasure and procreation.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Consequently, we place
the relevance of image to male-female, not directly in the physical domain, but
contextually in the interpersonal framework where the physical body and human
sexuality function. Physical relationship occurs in interpersonal relationship,
and physical relationship bonds interpersonal identity uniquely between husband
and wife. As a result, analogy to the trinity teaches us about the divine
intent in marriage as an interpersonal experience, and the interpersonal
intimacy of the marriage experience helps us comprehend something about the
divine trinity in whose image men and women are created. In other words, the
image of God in each individual person manifests itself in ideal marriage as
well as in ideal society. The socio-physical unit we call marriage bears
further analogy to the social-spiritual unit we call trinity (cp. 1 Corinthians
<b>6</b>:17). As such, marriage participates in the less specialized
interpersonalism that all persons have capacity for: they can be one as Father
and Son are one (John <b>17</b>:22), and they can be one with the Father and
the Son in the same way the Father and Son are one with each other (<b>17</b>:21).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The dignity of marriage
nevertheless harmonizes with the validity and wholeness of persons not married,
because the interpersonal capacity accentuated in marriage finds expression in
all other interpersonal relations as well. The interpersonal oneness of
marriage simply adds the dimension of physical intimacy (Genesis<b> 2</b>:24;
Ephesians<b> 5</b>:23-33). The total, permanent, exclusive identity of
husband-wife is reminiscent of the Father-Son-Spirit. In his own image God
created them male and female.<b> </b></span></p>

of harmony defines the image of God in connection with the God-man parallels. The
principle of contrast defines the image in connection with the man-animal
distinctives since no animal is said to be created in God’s image. The
man-animal distinction is further reinforced by other observations. No mate for
man was found in the animal kingdom (Genesis <b>2</b>:18-20). Animals could be
killed but not man (Genesis <b>9</b>:6). Cohabitation between man and animal
was punishable by death under Mosaic legislation (Exodus <b>22</b>:19;
Leviticus <b>18</b>:23;<b> 20</b>:15-16; Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:21). Man was
given dominion over the animal kingdom (Genesis <b>1</b>:26, 28; <b>2</b>:18-20).<span

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If the image is the
interpersonal capacity, in order to be distinguished from animal, man does not
have to be different in every respect nor absolutely unique in any one respect.
Rather, the <u>degree</u> to which he possesses these abilities is sufficiently
greater that in combination they can constitute man’s uniqueness as a total
being–interpersonal capacity. Most specifically, then, man’s uniqueness from
animals would not be jeopardized by discovering, for example, rudimentary
intelligence seen in crude tool making (<i>vs</i>. tool using) or perhaps in
elementary language learning and usage—which has not satisfactorily been
demonstrated despite claims to that effect.<span style='position:relative;

trait.</span></p>

resist the constant temptation toward reductionism and therefore fragmentation.
So much thinking about the <i>imago dei</i>–and many other subjects as
well–focuses attention on specific distinctives rather than on the integrated
whole. Evolutionary thinking offers one relevant example. <u>Evolution</u>
arranges “kinds” in a sequence based on relative complexity amidst similarity
and then correlates that “logical sequence” with chronological sequence. The
next item up the evolutionary “tree” is contemplated in comparison to the one
preceding it. It is a matter of adding new features and subtracting or altering
old ones. It is a process of complexification through time. When theistic
evolutionists plug mankind into this scheme and integrate their format with
biblical considerations, the image ends up being something added onto animal
nature (<i>donum superadditum</i>). The “add-on” can be thought of as the
image, which roughly correlates with “higher nature” <i>vs</i>. “lower (animal)
nature.” This reductionist scenario works against wholeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Not only is the
resulting view reductionistic and fragmenting, it is also simplistic. Even the
distinctions between animals are more complex than that; much more the
distinctions between man and any one of them. The lack of adequate complexity
comes from confusing homologous<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11</span> with
same and from not appreciating the complexity that comes from interdependent
parts within a functioning whole. <u>You cannot seriate the origin or
interdependent, reciprocating parts</u>; that is, you cannot put in a time
sequence the beginning of parts that depend back and forth on each other. The
whole must be there from the beginning. Nascent and vestigial organs<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> would be dysfunctional within
the previous whole and would tend away from the viability of the organism
rather than enhance its survival as evolution theory requires. The only way to
get a whole from the beginning is through creation of the whole at the

within. </span></p>

actuality or provide for the whole that humanity particularly is. In discussing
the <i>imago dei</i>, we want to avoid that same fault of making mankind too
much like animal or overdoing the differences between them. Interpersonal
capacity seems to meet these requirements by keeping physicality and sexuality
within the image, on the one hand, while allowing for animals to have
characteristics that are not individually of sufficient degree to comprise in
the aggregate what we are calling interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

interpersonal capacity distinguishes glorification from deification</u>. John
says that Christians will become like Christ and see him as he is, in contrast
to seeing him as he was in manifested form (1 John <b>3</b>:2; cp. 1
Corinthians <b>13</b>:9-12). Being able to see him in his own nature does not
require being deity. The angels always behold the face of God (Matthew <b>18</b>:10,
<i>etc.</i>), but they are not deity. Becoming like him can occur by entering
the resurrected state—by receiving the spiritual body (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:40-55;
2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:1-10). </span></p>

.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Being in the image of
God differs from having a “spark of divinity” in us. Such language implies that
a piece of the One is imbedded in us. Earlier we spoke of being in the image of
God rather than having the image of God in us. We are not partly divine; we
share a common capacity with God. More importantly, the expression “spark of
divinity” in new-age thinking means that a piece of God is in us. That is also
different from having a shared characteristic. “Spark of divinity” speaks
quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Divinity is somehow diffused
throughout the universe, and each person has some of “it” (panentheism). The
image, however, represents common capacity, not overlapping identity. One man
is as distinct from God as he is from other men (John <b>17</b>:21). Interpersonal
capacity involves distinction between the persons, hence distinction between
mankind and God. The goal is to relate to another Identity (interpersonalism),
not to access Power for personal gain (individualism).</span></p>

partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter<b> 1</b>:4) means becoming righteous,
as the succeeding context in 2 Peter <b>1</b> shows. The apostle does not mean
that in the resurrection Christians become gods. Becoming like Christ no more
makes a man into a deity than being a spirit (Hebrews <b>1</b>:14) makes angels
deities because God is a spirit (John<b> 4</b>:24). Likewise having a common
capacity does not make man God now or in the resurrection. The issue is
glorification, not deification.</span></p>

regard “his own body” as his body (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:4). Individualism is

sub-capacities interanimate and compenetrate. These interdependent parts
combine to produce the resultant whole and its consequences. The boundary of
interanimating aspects defines the unit level. An individual aspect does not by

In the case of mankind, rationality or affection or will does not operate
independently to produce some effect outside the individual person. Rather,
these interoperating aspects of man combine to accomplish things beyond the
individual. So, the image as interpersonal capacity combines all sub-capacities

Christian human experience—as well as Paul’s personal testimony in Romans <b>7</b>:7-25.
In the interests of other questions also, scholars have argued whether the
apostle is describing (1) <u>pre-Christian experience</u> or (2) <u>Christian
experience</u>. Since the passage relates significantly to the depravity issue,
we have reserved our treatment of it for later. We consider Paul’s statements
as (3) <u>human experience under a legal perfection requirement contemplated aside
from the benefits of Christ</u>. Analysis and evaluation of arguments from
different perspectives appear later. Suffice it to say here, Paul’s inner
conflict does not reflect a <u>created disharmony</u> between different aspects
of the whole self or even a biologically inheritable <u>genetic defect</u> that
resulted from the Fall. Instead, that inner conflict results from attempting to
live up to a high moral standard in the face of present temptation to sin and
ingrained habit resulting from previous sin. Paul argues that his “higher self,”
the real “me,” is at odds with the tug of war that goes on within his members,
that is, within himself. The united “I” is both <u>in</u> the members (<b>7</b>:18)
and above them (<b>7</b>:20). Therefore, he means that his transcendent self
includes the lower self rather than existing in parallel with it. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Although there is no necessary impropriety in the
idea, we prefer to understand “indwelling” of the <u>Spirit</u> in a
non-locational sense. Other statements about one person’s being in another are
not locational (John <b>14</b>:10b + 12; Romans <b>8</b>:10 + John <b>6</b>:17;
1 John <b>4</b>:12 + Matthew <b>6</b>:9). Close unity is what the “a-in-b-in-a”
formula means in Johannine literature (John <b>10</b>:38;<b> 14</b>:20; <b>15</b>:4-9;
1 John <b>4</b>:15). Locational indwelling is a difficult concept especially if
we combine it with the idea of locational omnipresence. The Spirit’s character
is the same “spirit” that (a) totally characterizes believers all the way down
to the inner motives that become visible in outer action. His “indwelling” (b)
pictures the Christian alternative to self-centeredness and (c) contrasts with
demon-possession. That invisible personal influence is made more concrete by
speaking of it as located inside the person where observers cannot see it. In
like manner the <u>Father</u> (1 John <b>4</b>:12, 15), <u>Christ</u> (Romans <b>8</b>:10;
Galatians <b>2</b>:20; <b>4</b>:19; Ephesians <b>3</b>:17; Colossians <b>1</b>:27),

and <u>truth</u> (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:10; 1 John <b>1</b>:8) are said to be
“in” us. Conversely, persons (Galatians <b>3</b>:27; 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:17;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Roman church has taught for centuries that sexual
relations are for procreation only or, more exactly, that procreation must
always be potential in each sexual experience. This teaching represents an
over-reaction to the sexual promiscuousness of the pagan world. It also stands
as a remnant of Greek thought, which depreciated material existence or
considered it outright evil. In modified form Augustine integrated that notion
into Christian theology when he defined evil as privation in the form/structure
of substance and concluded that sexual desire <i>per se</i> was “concupiscence,”
a manifestation of the fallen nature that supposedly came on the human race
when Adam sinned. Had the Fall not occurred, sexual relations would have been
purely an act of the will. Although sex-for-procreation-only may be difficult
to <u>dis</u>prove, it has no positive foundation in revelation <u>for</u> it. 1
Corinthians <b>7</b>:5 implies a frequency of sexual relations that safeguards
against incontinence: <i>“Do not deprive one another except by concept for a
time . . . so Satan does not tempt you because of your incontinence.”</i> Paul
ties conjugal relations to sex drive rather than procreation. Making
procreation a constant in all sexual experience also makes abstinence the only
effective avenue open to those who cannot support or care for more children. It
also runs counter to the principle Paul states in this same context that <i>“it
is better to marry than to burn [with passion]</i>,” which is exactly what is
often—if not normally—going to happen with total abstinence. Marriage is
precisely the answer Paul gives to this problem.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Man’s responsibility for the animal kingdom is
directly stated and then implied by his naming the animals. Naming the animals
not only highlighted the fact that no creature among them corresponded to him,
but <u>implied higher responsibility</u> than they, even as naming a child or
pet does today. (Adam also named Eve, although New Testament writers never
allude to that point in commenting on the structure of the home; Genesis<b> 3</b>:20).
Further development of this idea led to the notion that naming something—or
even knowing its name—<u>gives control</u> over it (cp. the fairy tale about
Rumplestiltskin). Perhaps in keeping with this idea is the promise in
Revelation <b>2</b>:17 that Christ will give the overcomer a name no one knows
but the one that receives it. No one else will be able to control him (likewise
<b>19</b>:12; cp. <b>14</b>:3). There is a loose correlation between these
notions and the psycho-linguistic observation that having a term for something <u>clarifies</u>
it in a person’s mind. It gives the thinker a certain “control” over the idea
by taking away the mystery. This last point relates to the psychological
benefits of prayer and even “talk therapy” in counseling, which is built on the
observation that talking about something <u>reduces fear</u> of it. Finally,
there is a loose correlation between knowing a person’s name and being able to <u>influence</u>
him effectively.</span></p>

omnipotence, for example, in self-defense or nourishment (cp. Matthew <b>4</b>:3-4;

assumes that omnipresence is not immensity. God’s omnipresence is not a matter
of being so big he is everywhere. Psalm<b> 139</b> is the classic passage on
omnipresence; it discusses God’s omnipresence (<b>139</b>:7-10) in connection
with a presentation on his omniscience (<b>139</b>:1-6, 11ff). It seems likely
then that God’s omnipresence is by virtue of his omniscience; he is omnipresent
in the sense that he is omniscient. Since we do not know the nature of deific
spirit, we cannot know whether location even applies to God. </span></p>
