Image</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this chapter we
address more deliberately the issue noted before. A long-standing debate about
the image concerns whether to include the body in it. There are three ways to
relate the image and the body. The body might be (a) <u>part of</u> the image,
(b) <u>involved with</u> the image, or (c)<u> analogous to</u> the image. Several
considerations go into deciding whether the body is<i> </i><u>in</u>, <u>with</u>,
or <u>like</u> the image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> The main reason for
including the body is <b>(a)</b> for wholeness.  Earlier we objected to
identifying the image with the rational capacity because it is reductionist by
placing the image lower than the individual person. Identifying the image with
the non-physical part of us would also be reductionist and would create a
dualism between image and non-image factors in man. Historically, dualism has
tended, not just to <u>distinguish</u>, but to <u>divide</u> body from spirit
and to <u>depreciate</u> this corruptible aspect of us that does not correspond
with God the spirit (John <b>4</b>:24; cp. 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:17, <i>etc</i>.).
Greek dualism either considered material things less desirable than the ideal
things of which they are but poor imitations (Platonic dualism), or made matter
evil and spirit good (Gnostic dualism). So, if we opt for dualism in us
relative to the <u>imago dei</u>, we need to do so in a way that avoided such
weaknesses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A second reason for
including the body in the image is that <b>(b) </b>the Genesis text does not
say God’s image is <u>in</u> us but that we are in his image. Saying that his
image is <u>in</u> us could imply that it constitutes less than the whole of
what we now are. The wording seems to indicate that in our earthly condition—in
our creatureliness, physicality, individuality, corporateness, and even
sexuality—we are in the image of God, yet without making God himself a physical
or sexual being. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Thirdly, <b>(c)</b> the
image-likeness terminology applied to God and Adam is likewise applied to Adam
and Seth (Genesis <b>5</b>:1-3; cp. <b>1</b>:26-27),<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span> so physicality can be included in these words if context
warrants. The words are used then in connection with both divine creativity and
human procreativity. The degree of likeness between Adam and Seth was greater
than that between God and Adam since God does not have a physical component. The
issue is not the expression used but the referent intended. What “image and
likeness” means depends on the subject.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Reasons Against Including
the Body in the Image</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Against including the
body in the image is <b>(a)</b> the fact that God does not have a physical
body. Much of the biblical objection to idolatry stems from its making God into
the likeness of corruptible things (Romans <b>1</b>:23). Idols do more harm
than good in worship. While they might help focus the mind, what they focus the
mind on is not what God is like. God is not immobile, inactive, insensible,
speechless, destructible wood, stone, <i>etc.</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Another factor looks
away from including the body in the image.<b> </b>We take it that <b>(b) </b>we
do not lose part of the image when we die. We do not cease to be mankind when we
lose the physical body. Consequently, the corruptible aspect of man relates to
the image differently than does the spirit that returns to the God who gave it
(Ecclesiastes <b>12</b>:7).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Resolving the Dilemma</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The question about body
and image poses a dilemma between affirming our wholeness, on the one hand, and
reducing God to a flesh-and-blood being, on the other. To avoid making God in our
image, we feel forced to affirm dualism in us and deny that the body is part of
the image. Only part of us corresponds with (part of) God. Our physical
component lies outside the set of shared characteristics, and God surely has
other characteristics than the ones he shares with us. The “overlap” is the
image. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But we ask whether we
are forced into this dilemma. In controversial matters, it is best to see what
the essential aspects of the issue are, to handle these correctly, and then to
see whether we can solve the larger question. The essential issues here are
retaining a positive attitude toward physicality, affirming the wholeness of humankind,
and avoiding a flesh-and-blood God with sexuality and the like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> First, we can
distinguish <u>dualism and division</u>. Two different kinds of things can
nevertheless relate harmoniously. Different does not have to mean separate or
divided. “Dualism” is not bad as long as the two aspects relate positively; so
the real concern is not dualism but holism. The body’s being or not being part
of the image presents no difficulty if the body is not depreciated by leaving
it out of the image or God degraded by putting it in. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Second, we must
distinguish <u>ontic and operational dualism</u>, two “beings” and two
behaviors, two kinds of parts and their working in parallel or in competition. We
could say that for now, man in his wholeness <u>is comprised of</u> at least
two different types of “stuff”–corruptible and incorruptible, what dies and
what does not.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> In that
respect, duality would exist, which is okay since the two aspects combine <u>functions</u>
harmoniously. Two “substances” can work together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It seems to us,
however, that if the <u>imago dei</u> is interpersonal capacity, we do not have
to eliminate or include the body as part of the image. Instead, we see a kind
of capacity that the body expresses, and a kind of behavior that could be
expressed otherwise but for now is expressed through a physical medium. If the
physical body relates to the image in other than negative or neutral fashion,
we can affirm our wholeness as well as our being in the image of a spiritual
God. For one thing, even though each person is a whole, we may say that <b>(1) </b><u>some
components are more essential than others</u>. As the heart is more essential
than the feet, so the incorruptible is more essential than the body: we can
lose the body without ceasing to be human, and we can be given a new one
without becoming another “species.” Physicality is a non-essential variant
within a larger whole. Under this picture the body would be <u>involved with</u>
the image but not <u>included in</u> it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Not essential” yet “involved
in” avoids dualism by affirming degrees of essentialness within the whole. Interpersonal
capacity can operate in different mediums.  We say then that the image as
interpersonal capacity resolves the issue about whether the body is part of the
image. It does so because interpersonal capacity can operate within or without
physicality. Indeed, it can function within any ontic medium and, as far as we
know, without any medium at all. As long as any particular medium is part of
the whole that a person is, it is functionally part of the image in us since it
is part of our identity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Whether we feel a need
to include in the image depends on what the image is and what <u>dualism</u>
indicates.  We have identified the image with the cluster of characteristics—however
rooted or caused—that constitute interpersonal capacity. That capacity is the
constant that pervades all examples of persons human, divine, angelic, or
otherwise. Distinctives between and within orders of persons become
non-essential variants that produce “modes” of personhood—like sexuality does. Such
non-essentials are nevertheless integral, harmoniously interanimating parts of
the whole that each person is. The image is the <u>capacity</u> for personhood
as distinguished from the <u>operation</u> of that capacity. It is nature
rather than ethics. If the body is not part of the image, it is still part of
the whole that each of us is functionally and psychologically. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Besides distinguishing
degrees of essentialness in the parts of the whole, we can observe that <b>(2)</b>
<u>non-essential variants are subsumed under the image in harmonious
interaction</u>. They are not functionally or psychologically parallel to the
image or negatively contrary to it. As even the non-essential members of the
body are under the control of the “head,” so also the physical body is under
the direction of interpersonal capacity. That capacity is now grounded somehow
in the physical nature. The interpersonal God who created us will create a new
body for the image to operate in—something Paul calls a “spiritual body” (1
Corinthians <b>15</b>:44ff.).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> This
understanding of human personhood means that we do not have to “hang onto” the
body for fear of losing identity, because the inner self is “the true me”; nor
do we have to depreciate the body as if it were a hindrance to “the true me.” However,
we do have to transcend the body with “the true me.” The image as interpersonal
capacity means we do not have to include or eliminate the body as part of who “I”
sense myself to be. If we include it, we regard it as a functional variant; if
we eliminate it, we regard it as functionally expressive of the image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Although we may not
have to include the body in the image, frankly it seems more natural to do so. We
already observed that <b>(a)</b> including the body more easily guarantees our
wholeness and that <b>(b) </b>the Genesis text says we are in the image of God,
not that the image of God is <u>in</u> us. Moreover, 1 Corinthians <b>15</b>
and other texts speak of <b>(c)</b> the destiny of the <u>whole</u> person by
including resurrection of the body along with “rest” of us. Although we have
cautioned against making Christ’s experience an exact prefigure of our own, we
do see at least an analogy there. His death-resurrection-ascension includes the
body at all points. Second, Adam was a spiritual, heavenly, life-giving spirit;
but while he was these things, the transformed body was part of him. He was
what presumably we all are, are to be, and will be. We do not mean to include
the body in the image in a way that implies that the Son now has a fleshly
nature. We mean only that the body can be included in the image because it can
be included under interpersonal character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A fourth observation is
terminological and operational: <b>(d)</b> when we say something is “like”
something else, we have the whole entity in view including unshared
characteristics. “Likeness” indicates that there are shared <u>and</u> unshared
characteristics; otherwise, the two things would be “same,” not similar. In
this fashion if we are in the image and likeness of God, we and God have shared
and unshared characteristics. So our likeness to him indicates first that the
unshared characteristics are also in view and they are designed to operate
under the framework of the shared characteristic, the higher nature, the
interpersonal capacity. The shared characteristic is the larger category that
contains the unshared characteristic. Unshared does not mean irrelevant; the
body is integral to us and therefore integral to what comes under “the lordship
of the interpersonal capacity.” Unshared characteristics are not just <u>ideally</u>,
but <u>in fact</u>, under the interpersonal capacity since we cannot function “un-interpersonally.”
There are degrees to which we do not conform our bodily behavior to <u>ideal</u>
interpersonal living, but even in sinning we use the interpersonal capacity to
some degree. Our body is part of our personhood, our interpersonal operating. Interpersonal
capacity is not just <u>in</u> us; <u>we</u> have interpersonal capacity. Genesis
does not say that we are like God <u>in some named respect</u> as would be
implied by the statement, <i>“He is smart just like his dad.”</i> Instead, <u>mankind</u>
is said to be in God’s likeness and image. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The likeness between
man and God differs from the likeness between, say, the kingdom of heaven and a
mustard seed. This second kind of “likeness” involves items from different
categories that have some formal characteristics which enable the one to
picture the other in some respects. We are not dealing with previously existing
items that have undesigned similarities. God created us for the express purpose
of having what was like him: the summarizing statement about us is that he
created us in his image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Whatever the
substantive “bases,” or “causes,” of the capacity for divine likeness, the
cluster of abilities that comprise our <i>imago dei</i> are expressed in and
through the physical body or they would not have real existence at all. Functionally
there does not have to be—and “should” not be—a dichotomy in us (cp. 1
Corinthians<b> 12</b>:24-25). No part ought to be thought of aside from the
whole. Theologically, we are a whole and as a whole stand in God’s image by
creation (capacity) and function in his image by (inter)personal behavior.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> The use of the body is bounded by
the features of social interaction, even though bodily behavior may “transgress”
those boundaries. Christianity is not so much concerned with substance
questions themselves (<u>ontic</u> category) as with <u>active</u> and <u>relational</u>
ones. Substance issues are relevant but only insofar as our theories about them
do or do not fit with the expected behaviors. When scripture speaks of our
being created in the image, its ultimate concern is
theological/functional/relational more than ontic/hypostatic/ substantive. The
image has to include the ontic since it is creatable; but the image as “capacity”
is capacity for <u>operation</u>, and the operating makes potential into real. So
the created body serves now as part of the interpersonal capacity—part of the
image. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As the secular comes
under the sacred and the material comes under the spiritual, so also the body comes
under the image. In our earthly state, we can function and relate socially. Some
things are not necessarily sacred in and of themselves; but when they are
brought under the qualifying influence of the sacred, they cease to be purely secular,
and the sacred-secular dichotomy disappears. Some things are not necessarily
material in and of themselves; but when they are brought under the qualifying
influence of the spiritual, they cease to be purely material, and the
spiritual-material dichotomy disappears. Likewise, the physical body is not
necessarily interpersonal in and of itself; but since it is brought under the
qualifying influence of the interpersonal, it ceases to be purely a physical
body, and the physical-interpersonal dichotomy disappears. The body “becomes”
an interpersonal medium and instrument. For all we know, there may be two kinds
of “substances” in us, but they are not parallel categories; the one fits
within the other. Therefore, our body is part of the image of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;
line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><img width=223 height=155

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The accompanying
diagram shows how non-essential variants relate to the image. Items like
physical body and sexual difference can move into and out of the image without
altering what interpersonal capacity is and without changing what physicality
or sexuality is. The model shows how the image relates to death, resurrection,
the new “spiritual” body, incarnation. It is not so much a matter of adding
them <u>to</u> the image, but of adding them <u>into</u> the image. They become
additional factors in and through which interpersonal capacity expresses itself
as long as they are under the control of that capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We can mention here a
matter of consistency. If the body is in the image, is sexuality part of the
image? Apparently, we should include it, but we hasten to add that doing so no
more implies that God has sexuality than including the body implies that he has
physicality. The decisive point lies in the kind of thing the image is. Other
identifications of image may not be able to include the body, and that fact in
itself confirms our understanding of the image. If interpersonalism is the
definitive constant between us and God, then everything we or God is stands as
part of each one’s interpersonalness even though they do not have all the same
aspects or even the shared ones in the same degree. The character of something
is determined by the character of the category in which it operates. As
everything done in the category of faith has the character of faith, so also
everything standing inside the image has the character of the image. When
physicality, sexuality, and marriage are kept in the interpersonal category,
they have an interpersonal character and belong under the image.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Up to this point we
have been discussing whether the body is <u>part of</u> the image <i>vs.</i> <u>included
with</u> the image. A third option might be to consider the body <u>analogous
to</u> the image as a functional equivalent. The possibilities for analogy
depend on the ontic nature of God, which is something we do not know or can
know. Not even revelation about God’s substantive nature could help<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>very much because language can
communicate only what humans experience. Such is the case because experience
supplies the basis for the meaning of words.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>6</span> But we cannot experience God in his own nature;<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> that is the reason he has “manifested”
himself to us. For resurrected people Paul speaks of a “spiritual body,” but we
have no way of knowing what he means by “spiritual body,” whether a spiritual
body is what angels have, or whether they even have such a “body.” Even more is
this a moot issue in the case of God, who alone is independent, immortal being
(1 Timothy<b> 6</b>:16; cp. Exodus <b>3</b>:14, <i>etc</i>.). Hebrews <b>1</b>:3
does say that the Son is the very image of God’s “substance” (<i>hypostasis</i>;
cp. 2 Corinthians <b>4</b>:4; Philippians <b>2</b>:6; Colossians<b> 1</b>:15),
but that description stands in a list with “having made purification for sin”;
so we wonder whether <i>“image of</i> [God’s] <i>substance”</i> is describing
the Son during the incarnate state since that is where he accomplished his
atonement for us. So nothing can be concluded from Hebrews <b>1</b> about the
kind of “hypostatic” nature deity has aside from an incarnate state.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> Linguistically speaking, “substance”
may here be an ontic term for behavioral character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We discuss the nature
of deity here because the human body may conceivably have formal likenesses to
divine substance if deity has substance. Upright gait, bipedal motion,
opposable thumb, longer life, rational capacity, self-transcendent potential, <i>etc.</i>,
illustrate our relative dignity and freedom above the rest of the organic
creation. The interdependency and diversity of bodily organs might reflect the
complexity of personal interdependency and the diversity within the godhead. Woman’s
being created from man and children’s coming from parents might correlate with
the Father’s sending the Son who sends the Spirit; creation and procreation
would resemble commission and procession.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>9</span> Obviously, these are loose comparisons, and we question
their value since plants and animals also have these characteristics in some
degree. The parallels with divine nature could not be very specific because
bodily components are mainly features of physical necessity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In summation,
functionally and theologically the body does not parallel the image if the body
is contextualized by the image, analogous to the image, indirectly included in
the image, or if the body is considered a functional equivalent of the image, a
non-essential basis for the image, a medium of being the image, or an
instrument of expressing the image. Other definitions of the image may not so
naturally be able to include the body; but if we define the image as
interpersonal capacity, we see no difficulty in considering the body as taking part
in the image and therefore prefer so to regard the body. Its ability to include
the physical body and even sexuality again confirms the view that interpersonal
capacity is the primary meaning of the image of God.</span></p>

genealogy of Jesus. The physical descent is marked by the formula <i>x, son of
x</i> all the way back to Adam, who in turn is said to be “(son) of God” (<b>3</b>:38).
Obviously, language can exhibit some shift in meaning as required by the nature
of the subject even if examples of terminology fall in the same context. With
some degree of approval, Paul could say with Epimenides and Aratus that people

context, Paul talks about the transformation of those living at Christ’s coming
(<b>15</b>:51-54) and says that <i>“flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
of God”</i> (<b>15</b>:50). “Kingdom of God” here must refer to a future
reality beyond the church age since the apostle is speaking of things yet to
come (see also <b>6</b>:9; Galatians <b>5</b>:21; Ephesians<b> 5</b>:5; cp.
Acts <b>20</b>:32). “Flesh and blood” can be an expression simply for mankind
in contrast to God (Matthew <b>15</b>:17; Galatians<b> 1</b>:16), but it
probably has a more literal significance in <b>15</b>:50 (cp. John <b>1</b>:13;
<b>6</b>:54-56; 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:27; Ephesians <b>6</b>:12; Hebrews <b>2</b>;14

style='font-size:12.0pt'>We are speaking here of personal and interpersonal
behavior as such in contrast to non-interpersonal operations like chemical
reactions, electromagnetic processes, or plant and animal actions. That is
different from saying that we always behave personally and interpersonally as we
ought. Among other things, sinning is living contrary to interpersonal nature;
but even in our failures at living interpersonally, we are usually <u>mis</u>using
that capacity rather than <u>not</u> using it. We use an interpersonal capacity
in a dysfunctionally interpersonal way. For example, when one person curses
another, he negatively uses the interpersonal capacity of communication. Sin
itself is not even a possibility except in terms of the interpersonal capacity.
When by behavior we misuse the image, we have forgiveness (an interpersonal
act) by identification with the Christ who fully bore out the potential for
that image (ideal realization of interpersonal capacity).</span></p>

understanding, communicators have to resort to <u>analogy</u>, <u>negation</u>,

and negation tells him what something is not or is not like. Pragmatics
by-passes the mysterious and indicates what must be done in order to achieve
the practical results needed.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>We may even wonder how strictly to take the Hebrews
statement so as to infer that God even has hypostatic existence. Language can
use ontic/hypostatic/substantive terms for functional and relational realities
(cp. 2 Peter <b>1</b>:4, <i>“you might become partakers of the divine <u>nature</u>”</i>).
Though we do not argue for it particularly, it is conceivable that <i>“image of
his substance”</i> indicates the deific power and rank, or more exactly “authority,”
of the Son<i> vs</i>. angels. The Christological controversies of the fourth
century assumed that existence has to be hypostatic or has to have a
hypostatic/substantive base; in other words, existence has to act and relate on
the basis of, and through, “stuff”; otherwise, Athanasius, Arius, Eusebius, <i>etc.</i>,
would not have been arguing whether the Son was <i>homoousia</i> (“same” kind
of being) or <i>homoiousia</i> (“similar” kind of being). We cannot deal with
such issues satisfactorily because our understanding is limited to
possibilities in our incomplete human awareness, which we too easily consider
complete.</span></p>
