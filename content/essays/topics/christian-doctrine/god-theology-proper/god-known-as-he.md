<u>roles and imageries</u> for God are masculine. He is king, not queen (of
heaven or whatever). He is the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, not the
mother. He is creator by will and authority, not by birthing. True, (a) the
gender of nouns used for certain (b) imageries do not in themselves indicate
the sex of (c) the referents. Nevertheless, in virtually all nouns, grammatical
gender does line up with the sex of the imagery and its referent. For example, </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
English, male and female referents have correspondingly masculine and feminine
nouns. We identify as neuter (it) anything that is not male or female. Hardly
ever does anyone these days refer to a ship or country as “she.” The neuter
pronoun often designates an animal if its sex is not known or is not important
to the discussion. With people, we might call a baby “it” if we do not know
whether it is a boy or girl. English pronouns are largely common, that is,
applicable to male and female: I/me/my, we/us/our, you/your, they/them/their,
who/whose/whom (ever), that/those, this/these, another, (any/some/every)one,
one another, one/ones.  Only the third person singular personal, intensive, and
reflexive pronouns necessitate sex-reference: he/him/his, she/her,
himself/herself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
the biblical languages—Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek—sex reference and noun gender
almost always correlate. (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt;

any gender, but that is by convention. So, aside from sex reference the
grammatical-physical correlation breaks down. A spear may be neuter (</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            These
comments about grammatical gender <i>vs</i>. sex reference help in dealing with
a few points that might cloud the claim made in the lead sentence of this article.
The <u>Hebrew</u> term for the “spirit” of God in the Old Testament is feminine
(</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>רוּחַ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><span
dir=LTR></span>). Hebrew has no neuter gender; so all referents, sexual or
otherwise, are masculine or feminine. Furthermore, this word has its first
application outside the personal realm; it means “wind.” Wind serves as a physical
image for a non-physical referent/reality: spirit, with or without
capitalization, whether having divine reference or not, whether being a
descriptor or personal name. (Hebrew has no capitalization, and Greek uncial
script from biblical times had capitalization only; hence, for different
reasons, there is no formal proper noun-common noun differentiation in either
language.) It becomes a picture for an intangible “reality,” and so is applied
to a non-physical real deity. So the inference is not, for instance, that there
is a feminine aspect of deity. The term is feminine, but the referent is not
female whether referring to God or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            A
similar point applies to the <u>Greek</u> word for spirit. </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Πνεῦμα</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
is neuter. It likewise has a physical first application: <i>“The wind blows”</i>
(John <b>3</b>:8). Again, wind became an image for a non-physical/visible
“reality” that was applied to non-physical/visible real deity, the (Holy)
Spirit—as well as spirit in its six or seven other biblical usages. So in one
case (Greek), the basis for the imagery is neuter while in the other it is
feminine (Hebrew). The inference is not that there is some female, neuter, or
male component to the nature of the God of the Bible. At the grammatical level,
God is “he,” which reflects the gender of the dominant nouns for roles that God
has and performs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Personal
<u>manifestations</u> from the spiritual realm are masculine in the Bible. That
is so despite the fact that spiritual beings are never characterized as sexual.
In scripture, sexuality is a distinctive feature of the physical order; it is
never attributed to God or angels. Even more generally, spirit is parallel to
physical: <i>“a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have”</i>
(Luke <b>24</b>:39), hence, not sex; <i>“God is [a] spirit”</i> (John <b>4</b>:24)
as are angels (Hebrews 1:7 &lt; Psalm <b>104</b>:4). Yet when an entity from that
realm enters the physical realm, the description is masculine, including the angel
of the Lord, who often carries deific descriptors. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Pagans
evidently projected sexuality onto their gods in some way to consider them
consorts, queens, goddesses, and female. Perhaps they pictured them as
materializing or “materializable” into sexual beings. But divine and angelic
manifestations in the Bible are not like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
<u>incarnation</u> was masculine. When God sent the “Son” into the world, he
sent him as male. That feature of his incarnate state carried through in the
resurrection “appearances,” which evidently could be called materializations: he
could eat (Luke <b>24</b>:41-43) and be touched (John <b>20</b>:27, <i>etc</i>.).
At the same time, he could become sensibly present in a locked room (John <b>20</b>:19),
could disappear (Luke <b>24</b>:31), and ascend to heaven (Luke <b>24</b>:51).
That involved miracle as well, like his walking on water during his ministry
(Matthew <b>14</b>:25; Peter too; <b>14</b>:28-41).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
the <u>resurrection</u>, humankind will presumably be asexual since people do not
marry or continue to be married there; they are like the angels (Matthew<b> 22</b>:30).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Personal
<u>imageries</u> for deity are masculine. The overwhelming number of such imageries
for God are male. He is king of Israel, not queen. He is the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, not mother. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Consequently,
God as “he” does not derive from anything male in his ontic nature. It is a
phenomenon rooted in language. (He is not called “it,” of course, because God
is personal rather than a thing, force, principle, or idea.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Scripture
does not explain why it refers to God as he, but the human languages it used forced
a choice about grammatical gender. Since God is personal, masculine and
feminine terminologies are the options. Uniform masculine usage in that regard over
1500 years by more than 40 authors in a wide range of cultural and religious circumstances
suggests there was a significant reason, one that must lie in <b>(1)</b> <u>appropriateness</u>.
So, maintaining that practice rests on <b>(2) </b><u>approved precedent</u> set
by divinely commissioned representatives. We have no new reason for speaking
differently about God than biblical writers did. Nothing about modern
considerations calls for abandoning the scriptural pattern. We are not more
informed than inspired writers who spoke under God’s protective and guiding
hand. Bringing in “new factors” would declare some kind of disbelief in the adequacy
of the revelation that has come to us—as if the biblical writers did not take some
factor into consideration, were blinded by some cultural limitation without
divine correction (2 Samuel <b>7</b>:3ff), or were simply ignorant of something
important that we now know. Taking that approach casts the issue back into a
disbelief in the sufficiency and inerrancy of divine guidance, and suggests
that Christians today have a source superior to the Source that oversaw
inscripturation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Another
reason for masculine terminology can be that <b>(3)</b> <u>male better conveys
strength</u> (1 Peter<b> 3</b>:7; cp. Jeremiah <b>31</b>:22). God as eternal creator,
sustainer, and ruler of all humankind and the whole universe does not mix well with
descriptions that depict relative weakness. God has no non-physical attributes that
call for female nature to get them included in the full picture of his nature. Distinctively
male-<i>vs</i>-female characteristics do not exist in the spiritual realm: reproduction,
and related factors. God is called “he,” not because he is male, but because he
is powerful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Power
relates, in turn, to <b>(4)</b> his <u>personal “ultimateness”:</u> <i>“I AM
BECAUSE I AM”</i> (Exodus <b>3</b>:14). Ultimate responsibility correlates with
ultimate power to maintain it against all challenges to it: omnipotence. Ultimate
reality as creator of everything else involves determining the purpose of what
exists besides God, which in turn makes God the determiner of right and wrong,
good and bad; that determination always derives from purpose. For personal kind,
purpose includes ethics and morality. Maintaining purpose ultimately requires success
in power encounter as the final defense against what opposes God. Authority
does not suffice. Authroity is a derivative determiner that needs power to
“make it stick.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Keeping
sexuality out of the picture stays away from<b> (5) </b><u>picturing him in
unworthy ways</u>, as in having a consort. It stays away from concretizations
in idols and their physical, hence, sexual representations or as abodes of the
deity. Avoiding divine sexuality takes away any reason for fertility rites,
temple prostitution, or the sexual lure of female deity. Sexuality has nothing
to do with the divine nature, function, or worship. We do not need to appeal to
the feminine to gain psychological and interpersonal qualities for deity like
caring, responsiveness, cooperation, tenderness, patience. Caring does not have
to come from comparing him to a nurse, for example, any more than protection
has to come from comparing him to a chicken (Matthew <b>23</b>:37). The “nurse”
imagery is actually masculine in Numbers <b>11</b>:12 and Isaiah <b>49</b>:23 anyway
(nursing father; cp. 1 Thessalonians <b>2</b>:7 + 11). Such qualities are not
distinctively female traits and so do not call for invoking female imagery to
get them included in his nature. Consequently, nothing appropriate is gained by
called God “she.” </span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
cases appealed to for referring to God as “she” come from the interpretation
error called “allegorizing the comparison”: Deuteronomy <b>32</b>:11-12 (like a
mother eagle); <b>32</b>:18 (the Rock that bore you, the God who gave you
birth); Psalm <b>12</b>:12 (like the mother of a weaned child); <b>122</b>:2-3
(like a mistress looked up to by her maid); Isaiah<b> 42</b>:14 (like a woman
in labor; cp. Paul in labor for the Galatians in <b>4</b>:19!); <b>49</b>:15
(like a nursing mother); <b>66</b>:13 (like a comforting mother); Hosea <b>11</b>:3-4
(like a mother); <b>13</b>:8 (like a mother bear); Matthew <b>23</b>:37 = Luke<b>
13</b>:34 (like a hen gathering her chicks); Luke <b>15</b>:8-10 (like a woman
looking for a lost coin). When readers carry comparisons beyond the writer’s application,
they lose the writer’s authority. They are making the affirmations on their
own. Such inferences would be like claiming Paul was a woman, that God has a
flesh-and-blood body, a bear’s hair, bipedal locomotion, or feathers!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Masculinity
for deific reference and conceptualization <b>(6) </b>stands in <u>deliberate
rejection of pagan conceptualizations</u>, which included sexuality. It
deliberately rejected those ideas because it consistently contrasts with them. No
polytheism, no male <u>and</u> female deities, not even God as “materializable”
by way of female idols, no animal representations like the golden calf (Exodus <b>32</b>).
God could not even be seen in his own nature (Exodus <b>33</b>:17-23; 1 Timothy<b>
6</b>:16), and his people repeatedly feared that seeing him would kill them
(Genesis <b>32</b>:30; Judges <b>6</b>:22-23; <b>13</b>:22). That whole set of
divine features flew in the face of pagan conceptualizations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Given
these considerations, the burden of proof for the propriety of addressing God
as she falls on the shoulders of those who propose to do that. What is the
reason and basis for that departure? Any push for addressing God as “she” has
no basis in his nature, in revelation, in some historical feature (patriarchal
society), or in some practical need. Instead, it comes from the rise of modern
feminism in its unscriptural and anti-scriptural forms and degrees. That
movement attempts to eradicate the divine order created in humankind and
communicated to them, and the relative gifting God has put with human persons.
Trying to erase human sexuality is not only unreal; it is destructive and contrary
to divine intent. Since purpose always determines right and wrong, the right to
determine purpose lies with the One who creates with purpose and bestows nature
correspondent to it. Acting as if human sexuality does not exist, fosters denying
other natural and revealed factors. Among other things, it shifts the basic
social unit from the family to the individual. It resonates with the homosexual
perversions of human nature and function, and calls for sameness as a means to
equality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            This
whole deviation is rooted in a false response to the drive for the meaningfulness
that is hardwired into human persons, <u>self</u>-esteem in particular. The
modern unisexual departure moves the basis for self-esteem from fulfillment of purpose
to success in competition, from being appreciated for self-giving love that
unifies, to competition that divides. Contrast replaces complement as the circumstance
of self-worth. It recasts meaningfulness in the comparison between persons
instead of the relationship between each person’s purpose and the fulfillment
of that person’s purpose. It attempts to erase roles and role emphases that
have any connection with sex. The full, wholesome situation supposedly does not
come from fulfillment of complementary roles, but from success in egalitarian
competition and sameness. If every person is not provided the same
possibilities, it is not “fair” because that person does not have equal,
unqualified access to what gives worth. “Equal” ends up meaning “same.”
Equality measures across individuals rather than within them between purpose and
fulfillment of purpose. Egalitarianism promotes a simplistic, inadequate
understanding of the complexity level in God’s intended arrangement. It settles
for an immature awareness of the subject at hand. Consequently, it is not a
progressive view, but a deficient one that sells short the complexity of
interpersonal process between highly diverse components in the process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Most
of the press for female terminology about deity comes from objecting to
patriarchal society, which supposedly moves in concert with projecting
masculinity onto deity. Extremes beget extremes, and that has happened with
roles insofar as they may relate to sexuality—roles in the home, church, and
general society. Placing <u>final responsibility</u> on the shoulders of the
husband in the home, for example, gets mistaken as a hint that husbands are <u>worth
more</u>. That is competition rearing its head as the basis for value and forgetting
the leveling effect of love (Colossians <b>3</b>:19, <i>etc.</i>). Solving the
objection to <i>divine masculinity</i> will not happen till the <i>theory of
worth</i> is shifted away from competition, and <i>leadership</i> <i>theory</i>
shifts away from power and authority to divine intent and personal competence. Admittedly
the feminist push-back comes partly in response to mistaken and exaggerated
notions of leadership and the manner in which it resides in human interaction
everywhere. Correct that, and much of the objectionableness disappears. So to
speak, who cares about rank when real love governs at all levels and sets the
circumstance for worth? (cp. Christ, Ephesians<b> 5</b>:25)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
primary push for including “she” in pronominal reference to God does not start
with God or revelation at all. It does not start with the perception of
something objectively real but with the desire for something subjectively
arbitrary. (Remember here the comments about the misguided basis for worth and the
need to understand the proper approach to leadership<i>.</i>) The idea is to
pronounce equality on all humankind as a matter of abstract principle. Presumably
it is designed to short-circuit pride over being one kind of human (male) and
another (female), but it is doubtful whether the new conceptualization escapes
pride any better than the “patriarchal” one properly practiced, that is,
without its misconceptualizations,  exaggerations, and abuses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Feminism
suggests that the earlier Judaeo-Christian heritage projected maleness onto God
because that is what they perceived about themselves as superior because they
were male, bigger, stronger, and having greater stamina. The starting point for
such deific reference, then, was supposedly with humankind. But the same
process is occurring now with a subjective human viewpoint wanting to correct
the former human viewpoint (God as masculine) by projecting female or male-plus-female
gender onto deity. That renovation tries to avoid the undervaluing of female
that is supposedly implied by making masculinity the consistent feature imbedded
in God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
procedure proceeds from an abstraction. It chooses one feature because it desires
the effect of that feature: that all individuals have an equal place in the system.
One trouble with arbitrary ideas is that they are simplistic; they do not include
the <u>collective features</u> and their interactions. Secondly, abstract ideas
do not necessarily reflect the <u>real circumstance</u>. The proposition endeavors
to minimize or disregard actual variants in humankind. Questions like these
might be asked:</span></p>

Is it true that women are as big and strong as men and therefore as able to
project security and stability as men can? (Note the attempt to get hold of the
reins of authority as a means of control, which is then maintained by the power
of others.)</span></p>

Is it true that evolution can replace creation, and science can replace
revelation so a humanistic construction can be discovered?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            With
such questions in mind, is it appropriate to project femininity or
male-plus-female onto monotheistic deity? Mankind is creating God in “hesh”*
own image rather than humankind being second by virtue of being <u>created</u>
from God-kind. Is humankind in any position to construct a philosophy of humanness
that does not regard Godkind as in primary position (by virtue of creation) to
set the agenda for humankind? (“hesh” coined for third-person common) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Furthermore,
human construction rather than divine <u>revelation</u> is the source of the feminist
idea. Evolution replaces creation, and scientific progress replaces revelation.
The process refuses qualified guidance in preference for searching and
experimentation. Feminism’s approach to conceptualizing God represents the same
process that it accuses patriarchy of doing. Pagan cultures did the same thing in
projecting sexuality and polytheism onto deity. Feminism ends up doing
something akin to paganism when it comes to the nature of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            To
make the feminist attitude toward divine nature work, a person would have to
assume that the New Testament—and the Old—were a product of its time, not
something based in divine revelation. No more did it offer objective truth
about divine nature than what feminism imagines today. In place of divine
origin via revelation, the New Testament and today’s alternative to it are both
products of their own times. Evolutionary process has supposedly moved forward
to some more sophisticated attitude toward God (if God exists) and the
correlative behaviors of humankind (if that matters). Divinely given scripture
as the arbiter of human conduct gets replaced by human striving for a supposedly
superior frame of reference that gives credence to a more enlightened,
self-generated perspective. Interestingly, that perspective just “happens” to
corroborate the desired unisex attitude toward humankind and toward the God humankind
is presumably in the image of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            God
known as “he” is revelation’s consistent presentation. Nothing is gained by
departing that characterization, some things are lost, and foreign factors get
introduced. It is the same process seen in every other effort to give
respectability to a foreign philosophy by piggybacking it on the Christian
faith—all the while denying the Christian view of God and people.</span></p>
