יהוה אלהינו יהוה אהד

“Yahveh our God <em>is</em> one Yahveh.”

“Yahveh <em>is</em> our God, Yahveh alone.”

“Yahveh <em>is</em> our God, Yahveh <em>is </em>one.”

“Yahveh <em>is</em> our God; Yahveh <em>is</em> unique.”


A Jewish                                	   	  A  Jewish

Viewpoint      	Response      	 Response                   	Counter-response


Deuteronomy <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:4  “us”              	(a) majestic plural        	Genesis   <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:22*   “one   of   us”

does not mean majestic plural;

it is the clearest Old Testament

text   on   plurality   associated

with trinitarian deity.


one = single        	Genesis <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:26;   	(b) angels + God = “us”   (1) Angels  not  yet   mentioned

being	    *<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:22; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:7				   in   Genesis.  Genesis   <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:24

(Isaiah <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:8)                           			      refers  to   them  later  (note

Job  <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>:7 and <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:6 however).


(2) Besides, in the statement of

fulfillment       after       the

proposal  in  Genesis  <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:26,

the  text  affirms that it is in

the image of God.


(3) It is in  his  image  (<em>i.e</em>.,  not

plural as one would expect

if “us” in <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:26 meant God +

angels).


Deuteronomy<strong> 6</strong>:4: (1)					The  “Shema”  needs  to contri-  								bute   to our  loving  God com- 			pletely.   That  he  is  a  single being  <em>vs</em>. a  trinity does  not  give  a reason for

loving him.  The point is rather  that one  means “unique,” or  “only one”  (no

other  gods); both  ideas  can  contribute  to reasons for loving him.


(2)  אֶהָד  (“one”) does not  eliminate  distinction  between  the  sub-units

of what is “one.” A good example is Genesis <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:24, where husband +

wife = אֶהָד (“one”) flesh.

Note: The preferred translation of Deuteronomy<strong> 6</strong>:4 is <em>“Yahveh is our God, Yahveh  alone.”</em>
