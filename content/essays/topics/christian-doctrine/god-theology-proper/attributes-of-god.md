<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            5.  Two ways by which we speak of God’s
nature even though by experience we do not know what spirit is like: (a) by
negating the characteristics of the material/physical world; (b) by taking
shared characteristics via <i>imago dei</i> and pushing them to absolutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some characteristics of deity are
difficult to discuss because we are not sure they correlate closely with our
form of existence. That difficulty applies especially to omnipresence,
omnipotence, eternality, spirituality, imperceptibility. For that reason (1) we
talk about God in negative terms: he is not limited by time and space, not
perceivable, not material. The negative approach applies particularly to his
natural attributes <i>vs</i>. moral attributes. A second way we conceptualize
God’s traits is that (2) we push shared characteristics to the absolute: omniscience,
omnipotence, love, holiness, and the like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I. Natural attributes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  Eternality</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  God is superior to, not bound by,
time (Psalm <b>41</b>:13; <b>90</b>:2; <b>106</b>:48). Sequence can be kept
with God, but there is no beginning or ending with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B.  Self-existence (aseity)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  He depends on no one or no thing for
his existence. All creatures apart from him owe their existence to him because
none of them have that quality. The name “Yahveh” itself has to do with being
(Exodus <b>3</b>:13-15). God is ultimate being—independent being. Self-existence
implies sovereignty. In God’s self-existence, the objective and subjective come
together in the ultimate and original One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            C.  Unicity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Solidarity in kind; singularity,
uniqueness. There is no genus, species, or class in which to list God (1
Corinthians <b>8</b>:4). He is in a class by himself; he <u>is</u> the class in
contrast to polytheism (Deuteronomy.<b> 6</b>:4). There are no other gods; Yahveh
is the only one that has deity. He is unique even in comparison to imaginary
gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            D.  Spirituality</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  John <b>4</b>:24: <i>“God is [a]
spirit.”</i> The concept is not exactly in the Old Testament (see 1 Kings <b>8</b>:27;
<u>Isaiah <b>31</b>:3</u>). God is spirit in contrast to (1) matter, (2)
abstract force, (3) weakness, (4) idea, (5) limitation by time and space. Spirituality
is revolutionary among the ancient religions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            E.   Perfection</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  God alone is not subject to external
standards of rectitude (Isaiah <b>40</b>:28; James <b>1</b>:13, 17; Matthew <b>5</b>:48
(Exodus <b>3</b>:14-15). Perfection is the only goal God can give (Matthew <b>5</b>:48;
<b>25</b>:28). We should not be surprised at the expectation for perfection;
even <u>we</u> do not tell a person not to steal too much or disrespect us most
of the time. God is the only one that has his characteristics in the absolute: eternality,
power, knowledge, love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            F.   Immutability                                                               </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Passages include Hebrews <b>6</b>:13-18;
<b>13</b>:8; James <b>1</b>:17; Malachi <b>3</b>:6.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Immutability means moral
self-consistency, unchangeableness, unchangingness. It means that he is fair. People
cannot accuse him of arbitrariness, favoritism, capriciousness, fickleness, and
the like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Immutability is unchangeable in his <u>nature</u>
and <u>purpose</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Self-consistency does not contradict
<i>sovereignty</i>. He chooses to act in self-consistent ways without a need to
get approval from any higher authority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Immutability does not mean God cannot
make <i>free decisions</i>. He can adapt to any situation; he changes in
response to changes in people. When people sin, they receive wrath from God. When
those same people become believers, he pours out his blessings without a change
in himself. God’s immutability <u>shows</u> when he changes his actions toward
changed people. His unchangeableness is seen in his changing (in changing circumstances
of nature). God can change his will for us according to our need in accordance
with his own ultimate purposes for us. God is changeable in the methods he may
employ to bring about his</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                    <img
width=154 height=108 src="/cir-library/images/essays/attributes-of-god/image001.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                         God's relation changes as the
object changes position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>unchangeable ends. Immutability does not mean God is
limited to doing <u>what</u> he did before, doing them <u>as</u> he did them
before, or doing everything he did before. A <i>miracle</i>, then, is not a
contradiction of natural law, and Christ does not have to work miracles in
every age just because Hebrews<b> 13</b>:8 says that he is the same yesterday,
today, and forever; the different “days” are in different circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Immutability also does not mean that
God cannot answer prayer. In answering prayer, he may decide to bring about a
result that would not otherwise have occurred. In so doing, he does not abandon
his principles (general will of God); he chooses another alternative he would
not have enacted if someone had not prayed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Immutability does not mean that God
cannot be <i>sorrowful</i>. In Genesis <b>6</b>:6 God did not experiment and
learn that he had made a mistake (See also 1 Samuel<b> 15</b>:11, 35; Numbers <b>23</b>:19;
cp. 2 Samuel <b>24</b>:16; contrast Exodus<b> 32</b>:14; Psalm <b>110</b>:4
&lt; Hebrews <b>7</b>:21.) He was sad that people had gone against their
creator. He knew from the beginning that people would sin (Ephesians <b>1</b>:4ff);
yet he grieved at the actual sinning. We know our parents will die; yet we
grieve when they do. When God “repents” it is not a moral change as in mankind.
<i>“God is a free person dealing with free human beings”</i> (E. Y. Mullins).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The first question with Genesis <b>6</b>:6
is whether the statement represents (a) an <u>anthropomorphism</u>, which
assigns human characteristics to God, or (b) <u>literal statement</u>. The
second issue is that if it represents a literal use of “repent,” whether it
means (a) to be “sad” or (b) to be “sorry.” The second alternative implies
error on God's part, and so for systematic reasons we do not choose it as the
meaning here. We may add that (1) in reference to self it means “grieve” but
(2) in reference to others it means “pity.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  This passage is “anthropopathic.” It
attributes to God the feelings of a human. Anthropopathic is a special kind of
anthropomorphism, which itself is a figure of speech that makes a comparison.
It involves a model, or similarity—in this case God’s feeling of sadness, but
it is not meant to include other aspects that are not part of God. The implied
ignorance that leads to mistakes and sorrow from them is not transferred to
God. This approach is not the one taken by liberal theologians, who see Yahwism
as a developing religion in which omniscience was not originally a divine characteristic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Immutability does not mean absolute
immutability, that is, immutability in every conceivable sense or circumstance.
It means moral and personal self-consistency within the framework of his personal
values and purposes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In summation, immutability does not
mean that God cannot (1) act, (2) do something new, (3) do something in a new
way, (4) stop doing something old, or (5) answer prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            G.  Omnipresence</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Psalm <b>139</b>: God is <u>transcendent</u>;
that is, he is not limited by time or space. The psalm closely associates
divine omniscience and omnipresence, which suggests that it would be
satisfactory say that God's omnipresence is by virtue of his omniscience.
Transcendence has to do with kind of being, not distance.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Hebrews <b>4</b>:13: he is <u>immanent</u>
in that he indwells time and space. Immanence deals with availability more than
nearness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Omnipresence is not a matter of
location or immensity even though God is said to “fill” heaven and earth
(Isaiah <b>66</b>:1; Jeremiah <b>23</b>:23-24; 1 Kings <b>3</b>:27). He is
omnipresent in that no point of time or space lacks connection with him. We do
not know enough about divine spirit even to know whether it is subject to
location. If we choose to speak of “immensity,” we should not mean it as alternative
to specific location. Spatial dimensions may not apply to God, or even to
spirit, at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Omnipresence is a way of getting
behind models that end up in tension with one another. The idea of his being
“near,” for example, is probably our human way of thinking about him so we can
feel that he is available to help us (power), that he is aware of what is
happening to us and what we are doing and feeling (knowledge), that he cares
about us, and so on. Picturing him as distant, or <i>“high and lifted up,”</i>
on the other hand, helps us respect him. Omniscience for omnipresence can
account for both of those matters without tension or contradiction.           </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  God’s omnipresence is assumed in the
biblical doctrine of prayer (Psalm <b>34</b>:15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We are not to conclude from
omnipresence that we can worship God in fishing, and so on, on Sundays, for
example, because in failing to meet with other Christians, we are not complying
with the commandments for corporate worship (Hebrews <b>10</b>:25). We do not
want to go to the extreme that because God is not in one place only, we are not
to meet together with other Christians for worship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  There is no contradiction between God’s
omnipresence and (a) <u>a manifestation</u> at a certain place; it is not lost
during an occasion of manifestation, especially if we see omnipresence as a
function of omniscience. Furthermore, omnipresence as a function of omniscience
means (b) there is nothing that the Son had to give up to become incarnate.
(See “The Christ.”) Immensity <u>would</u> imply giving something up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  “Omniscience” means knowing
everything. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Think how much God has to know (Psalm
<b>139</b>:1-6; <b>147</b>:5; Job <b>38</b>:4-5; Isaiah <b>40</b>:12-14;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  That God knows everything could be
inferred from his omnipresence if omnipresence means immensity. In reverse,
omnipresence could be inferred from—or even be another way of saying—his
omnipresence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We assume that God’s knowledge is
immediate (no discursive thinking, no reasoning to a conclusion), distinct,
complete, inclusive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Judging from the kinds of things
scripture says that God does know, we have no reason to eliminate any fact or
any kind of fact, including a future free-will act. If there is certainty on
something, it can be known. The future is certain because all other
possibilities for every point in time and space are eliminated by the only one
that really occurs. If the future is certain, it can be known—even if we in our
limitedness cannot understand <u>how</u> that is the case</span></p>

to what he has decided on, then the ramifications of what he has decided on
would also be unknowable. Perhaps there may be a difference between what God

the case of identification theory, God had Jesus go to the cross to qualify
himself as the most appropriate source of salvation for people whom God would
also ask to carry <u>their</u> obedience to him to the point of violent death

might be a better term. It involves God’s holy displeasure at sin, the reaction
of his nature against disobedience.</span></p>
