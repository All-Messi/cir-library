style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God’s reasons for creating us are
summarized under divine <u>self-fulfillment</u> (delight), <u>goodness</u>
(grace), <u>glory</u> and <u>betterment</u>. Of these four <u>reasons</u> the
first and last are personal while the other two are interpersonal. The first
two are the reasons for people; the third is the purpose of people beyond themselves.
If we speak strictly about the <u>purpose</u> of people, we focus attention on
God’s goodness and on what grow out of it, particularly dominion and
commission. <u>Self-fulfillment</u> highlights the unnecessitated satisfaction
that moves persons to express themselves. <u>Goodness</u> roughly corresponds
with God-to-man action; <u>glory</u> corresponds with man-to-God re-action. We
say “roughly” because we cannot draw a sharp line between these aspects, which
is exactly what we expect in the highly complex, reciprocating, transacting
activity that interpersonal process involves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            With God, <b>(a)</b> outward-directed
action gives fulfillment through self-expression in creation generally and in us
particularly as those on whom he can more fully bestow his love. It leads to <b>(b)
</b>the goodness of God in endowing us with capacities for more fully
experiencing the goodness and beauty of everything God makes and does and with
abilities that make us whom God can reveal himself to and call to mission. <b>(c)
</b>The glory of God is more the indirect <u>result</u> than an intended <u>purpose</u>.
Glory is an unnecessitated consequence that comes back to him through free-will
praise and gratitude for the glorious grace of creation, sustenance, and
redemption. God’s love and holiness are more basic than his glory; his goodness
in self-giving is more the concern than his glory from the response to it. God’s
delight in self-expression sets the category in which both goodness and glory
take place.</span></p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>God’s self-glorification and
foreknowledge</u>. Although God’s glory is more the result than the purpose of
his creating us, self-glorification does have a place under God’s <u>purpose</u>
for humankind. For one reason, with all-knowing deity it is not possible to
separate purpose and result entirely. With humans, results and purposes can be
separate because results may come that we do not intend. Since we do not intend
them, we do not know they are coming. That is especially the case when we
interact with other persons, who can choose their response. The best we can
have is relative certainty about how they will react. But with omniscient deity
there can be only a distinction between modes of purposing. We can distinguish
between one mode of purposing in which God initiates and another mode in which
he lets others initiate. In allowing others to carry out their own intentions,
God has made some kind of decision as to why he will not intervene to prevent or
alter. What they purpose to do becomes, in effect, a mode of his own purposing;
so, on the basis of his foreknowledge he ratifies, foreordains, predestines
what they do under his sovereignty. In this sense, we can say that God
purposefully predestines his own glory from our freewill praise, gratitude, and
obedience. That self-glorification comes off more like delight.</span></p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>God’s self-glorification and our need
to praise</u>. Much of the satisfaction of a blessing comes in praising the one
who gave it. Since God knows this, it is understandable, not only that his
prophets would urge their fellows to glorify him, but he himself might command
through them what in effect glorifies himself. That is what all his commands to
worship him amount to. But God did not command worship for his benefit so much
as for the benefit that comes to the worshiper in offering the sacrifices,
singing the hymns, observing the Lord’s supper, praying, and giving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>God’s self-glorification and our
foreseen sin</u>. The <u>first issue</u> under divine glory plus human sin is
whether the (1) fact of evil is compatible with the existence of a (2) holy,
(3) all-powerful God. Supposedly any two of these facts can be affirmed, but
all three would create inconsistency: there is evil, and God is holy, but he is
not powerful enough to stop evil. There is evil, and God is omnipotent, but he
is not holy. God is holy and omnipotent, but evil is an illusion. We cannot
enter into a full response to this standard “antilogism” that underlies
philosophical atheism; but four factors set the framework for answering it as a
background to dealing with the effect of evil on God’s delight, goodness, and
glory reasons for creating us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Those four factors are time, free will,
limitation, and redemption. <b>(a)</b> <u>Time</u> is important because a
logical analysis is timeless, or a-temporal; logic simply puts concepts beside
concepts and asks whether they fit together. Time provides the possibility of
beginning and ending evil. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(b)</b> <u>Free will</u> provides the
mechanism that can begin evil.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> Free
will in secondary agencies (people and angels) provides for the beginning of
evil outside of God; so God himself is not <u>guilty</u> for evil, because
guilt lies at the point of choice. Although God is not <u>guilty</u> of doing
sin, admittedly he is <u>responsible</u> for dealing with it, because he is
responsible for his own choice to create what could choose to sin and for his
own choice to let sin occur in his universe. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            He meets that responsibility in part by
putting <b>(c) </b><u>limitation</u> on the extent to which evil persons can
use their free will to oppose him. Their freedom is not absolute; it is limited
in degree and extent. Degree limitations include the creatures’ limited ability
levels, sin’s tendency to self-destruct because it usually runs counter to
nature, divine revelation to let freewill agents know what God considers evil,
and divine intervention along the way to stop what carries disobedience too far
to fit with God’s general purposes. Length limitations include the inability to
remember the sense of pain (we can remember only the fact of it), the death of
evil persons, and the consummation when God permanently removes evil from good,
punishes evil appropriately, and judges persons sensitively by gathering up in
judgment the inequities of opportunity during this life. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, God meets his responsibility for
evil by offering <b>(d)</b> <u>redemption</u>. The redemption possibility
provides for freewill transformation of evil back into good before evil is
finally overthrown. God created people despite his foreseen sin because at the
same time he planned to redeem sinners—as many as would use that same will to
turn back to him after experiencing sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A <u>second issue</u> under divine glory
plus human sin is whether God knew we would sin. During conversations about God’s
omniscience, people may ask why he created us if he knew we would sin. The
question implies that a holy, omniscient God would not do that. The inference
is that God must not be holy and loving or that he must not know everything
about the future, and the latter option is chosen.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span> But God goes ahead and blesses ahead of time those who he
knows will later misuse his blessing. Jesus healed the leper in Mark <b>1</b>:40-45
even though he knew the leper would disobey his injunction not to broadcast
what happened (cp. Matthew <b>8</b>:2-4; Luke <b>4</b>:42-43). He chose Judas
as an apostle even though Jesus knew he would later defect and betray him. Asking
the question about omniscience amounts to raising the “antilogism” issue again
since God’s ability to know everything is one aspect of his power to do
everything. Denying omniscience at the expense of holiness and love is
unnecessary for the reasons given above. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            God did know people would sin. The fact
that the Lamb was slain before the foundation of the world shows that God foreknew
our disobedience (1 Peter <b>1</b>:18-20; Revelation <b>13</b>:8; cp. Isaiah <b>52</b>:13-<b>53</b>:12;
Acts<b> 2</b>:23;<b> 4</b>:28). He planned the solution before the problem
arose. Scripture even says that he appointed individual people to the disobedience
and condemnation (1 Peter <b>2</b>:8; Jude 4; cp. Luke <b>22</b>:22; Proverbs <b>16</b>:4).
We take it here that predestination logically follows foreknowledge as in the
sequence of Romans <b>8</b>:29-30. Foreordination consists of ratifying the
actual fulfillment of foreseen intentions along with assigning to us individually
the destinies he likewise established for us before time eternal.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> At any rate, the predestination
of the plan of redemption and the reprobation of those who reject it confirm
the fact that God knew we would sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <u>third issue</u> under divine glory
plus human sin is positively why God created what he foreknew would sin.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> Showing that evil does not
eliminate God’s glory does not show that evil adds anything to it. It is one
thing to demonstrate the consistency of having evil in a holy, omnipotent God’s
universe; it is another thing to give reasons why a holy, omnipotent God would
go ahead and create freewill agencies despite their foreseen sinning. The first
effort neutralizes a negative; the second looks for a positive. By limitation
and redemption, God preserves the balance between <u>holiness and love</u> in
the face of evil; he preserves his “goodness reason” for creating people. Our
concern now, however, lies with his “glory reason” in the face of evil. Even if
nothing else could be said, creating us despite our foreseen sin corroborates
our belief that self-glorification is a derivative result more than the primary
purpose. Allowing the expression of evil shows that God is not self-centered
even though he created us to his own glory. In fact, he shows the quality and
degree of his “goodness” by balancing personal “delight” and “glory” with
concern for other persons. His is an interpersonal goodness, not just a stoic
goodness shown to impersonal reality.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            But positive things can be said also. <b>(a)</b>
God created us despite our foreseen sin because freewill existence enhances our
life quality. God preferred to bestow on us the greater life satisfaction that
comes from freewill existence despite the accompanying “risk” that freeing
others brings to one’s own freedom as well as theirs: others may take advantage
of it, the giver, and each other. Once God opted for entering a freewill
relationship, for consistency’s sake he would not turn around and disallow any
actual use of that will contrary to his own. That would make impossible in
practice what he made possible in capacity; for all practical purposes free
will would not “exist.” In this connection, God’s greater gifts indicate his
greater goodness and justify his greater glory, whether anyone recognizes it or
not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(b)</b> God created us despite our
foreseen sin because sin only accentuates God’s goodness and our recognition of
it. By contrast, the ugliness of sin enhances the beauty of holiness. Actual
evil is not necessary for <u>defining</u> good, because good can be defined in
contrast to theoretical evil. Actual evil is useful for <u>appreciating</u>
good. Evil is not necessary for <u>objective</u> definition of good, but it is
helpful for <u>subjective</u> appreciation of it. We can tie this observation
back into the glory issue by saying that God is more glorified by a remnant who
choose to repent from sin than he would have been by all who would have had no
choice but to do his will. He is more greatly glorified by some of us who trust
him out of free will than by all of us who could neither trust nor distrust
him. The observation relates to the idea that one repentant sinner causes more
rejoicing in heaven than ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance
(Luke <b>15</b>:7). Evil in our presence now not only increases our
appreciation of God’s goodness now and heightens our sense of dependence on him
to his glory, but our enduring the evil of others now will be more than
compensated by the glories that God will reveal later (Romans <b>8</b>:18;
Colossians <b>3</b>:4; Titus<b> 2</b>:11-14; 1 Peter<b> 1</b>:3-7; <b>5</b>:1),
and we, who were also evil, will glorify him all the more for giving us “a
second chance.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(c)</b> God created us despite our
foreseen sin because it would only establish a higher glory potential. Our sin
does not thwart God’s glory; it causes it to come about in a different way and
in some respects at a higher level. It establishes a higher glory potential
because redeeming back freewill deserters only highlights God’s goodness and,
therefore, his glory. Someone strong enough to deal with opposition either by
grace or force is greater than someone who does not or cannot deal with it. But
more than that, opposition only enhances God’s goodness and glory by showing
him greater in love. In allowing sin, he became still more “the God for others”
because he became “the suffering God,” yes even “the crucified God” (Romans <b>5</b>:8).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> God <u>gives</u> more than he <u>gets</u>.
In self-glorification, God’s goodness still predominates because he created us
despite our foreseen sin. God’s goodness predominates because he chose to give us
the grace of existence, and the like, despite our failure to receive it with
full appreciation and appropriate obedience. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (d)</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
The presence of evil also establishes the occasion for righteous persons to
develop virtues they would not otherwise have and to express care for others
who suffer the effects of evil—all of which further redound to the glory of
their God who does likewise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Because of his power, God knew that by
limitation he could handle the upcoming sin problem, and because of his holy
love he knew he would handle it first by offering redemption. Our sin is not a
comment on <u>God’s</u> nature and character but the comment of each of us on ourselves;
so our sin does not detract from God’s glory. In fact, God knew that he could
finally overthrow the majority who refused redemption, and that at the judgment
before our final overthrow even the lost majority would confess his glory (Romans
<b>14</b>:11; Isaiah <b>45</b>:23; cp. Philippians <b>2</b>:9-11). God knew he
could handle sin, knew how he could overcome it, knew that evil was
illegitimate, and made it to self-destruct. So, in a sense the old adage
applies, <i>“All’s well that ends well.”</i> The fact of evil is consistent
with a holy, loving, omnipotent, omniscient God who creates because of <u>delight</u>
and <u>goodness</u> unto his own <u>glory</u> and human <u>betterment</u>.</span></p>

we usually attribute the origin of evil to the capacity to choose, it more
exactly belongs to the rational capacity, which “precedes” the volitional one
(Justo L. González notes that Origen and Gregory of Nyssa both made this
observation long ago: <i>A History of Christian Thought</i>, Vol. I, p. 325). By
formal manipulation, reason enables a person to imagine the opposite of,
different from, or contrary of what is or ought to be. Will comes in then and
chooses that other behavior.</span></p>

“second” question may amount to a different framing of the first question about
the antilogism between holiness, omnipotence, and evil. The ability to know all
things is a species of the ability to do all things, if omniscience is thought
of as an <u>ability</u> to know all things rather than the knowing of all
things.</span></p>

little contemplation should cause us to see the inconsistency in saying that
God should not have gone ahead and created people he foreknew would sin. Obviously,
he would have had to create them before they would be in existence and commit
sin. The proposition must be dealt with in the abstract rather than in the
concrete—in the historical. God must have decided to create what had the
possibility of turning against him and have done so with certain backup systems
contemplated before he created freewill agents. </span></p>

are subtle but far-reaching differences created by the Christian belief that
ultimate reality—God—is interpersonal. Balancing personal delight with love for
created persons illustrates the point. The importance of interpersonalism shows
itself several times in our critique of traditional reasons for human
existence. Plato, for example, in the <i>Timaeus</i> dialogue speaks of God’s
goodness as a reason for creating the world, but for Plato “goodness” does not
mean benevolence or love, but law, order, and harmony. See Benjamin Jowett’s
translation of <i>The Dialogues of Plato</i> (New York: Charles Scribner’s
Sons, 1908), Vol. II, p. 524.</span></p>
