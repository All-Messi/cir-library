<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>I took the opportunity presented by your
question Sunday to assemble some thoughts that can also be part of the internet
ministry effort I am working on. There is probably enough here to founder a
good-sized horse, but that is the risk you take when you raise a good question
that is at the same time complex and controversial. The first attachment I
wrote up new as a second-level treatment of the trinity issue as I have come to
see it. The other two attachments are more elaborate because they are lifted
from my notes on Christian Doctrine, a course I taught at Manhattan Christian
College for many years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>A couple comments on the essay you gave
me. I wonder if Ho Soo Kam converted from an eastern religion with its
distinctive philosophical base. In some of this thinking, something can be and
not be at the same time and in the same sense. Such mystical thought is beyond
comprehension or evaluation—either verification or falsification—because there
is no active or experiential correlate to which it can be compared in human
experience. At any rate, his concept is a kind of unitarianism, or
monarchianism as it is also called (Patripassianism, economic trinity,
modalism, and Sebellianism are other terms as well; see attachment 3.) Another
label for it is <i>manifestative trinity</i> since it pictures the three-ness
as being in the manifestation of deity rather than in deity itself. So Father,
Son, and Spirit are three roles. One criticism of this idea has been that
during the incarnation heaven would have been empty of deity if, as Soo Kam
says, each member of the Godhead is all the deity there is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>The comment that caught my eye especially
was the idea that somehow it makes sense to say that 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 describes
the trinity. 1 and 3 are <u>numbers</u> of things, not things themselves. It
communicates no idea to say an orange times an orange, or perhaps more exactly
an orange times itself. What would it mean to say the Son times the Father? One
times the Son equals the Son, not the Father. In other words, we are dealing
with real persons in the trinity, not abstract numbers (metaphysics). The
“orthodox” view is expressed in “Holy, Holy, Holy” when it ends a verse by
saying, “God in three persons, blessed trinity.” The traditional formulation
has been summed up in the expression “one God in three persons.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>Hopefully, these notations make sense and
seem to fit the passages of scriptures that obviously relate to this issue. There
is no hurry in getting this matter “solved”; people have been thinking about it
for hundreds of years!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>P.S. In Christianity, God is able to be
incarnate in human flesh without <u>defilement</u><em> </em>or<em> </em><u>deficiency</u><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, which corresponds to the interpersonal capacity in
humankind. </span></em>He was “incarnatable”&nbsp;because we humans are created
in God’s image—the “us-ness” of God in Genesis <b>3</b>:22. In the incarnation,
Christ could “empty” himself (Colossians <b>2</b>:5-11) of the free exercise of
his rights and prerogatives as deity without ceasing to have his identity or
nature/deity. The exact nature of his experience in the incarnate condition is,
of course, not capable of being reflected in ourselves because we are not Jesus
and our experience as persons is not his type of personhood.</span></p>
