<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Distinctness within the One Deity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The trinity
question calls for analyzing <u>activities</u> between Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit. Approaches based on <u>words</u> are less satisfactory because words
can vary in their meanings. Many attempts to arrive at a scriptural understanding,
however, rely on (unclear) <u>words</u> rather than on (clearer) relational
behavior. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Words like <i>one</i>
or <i>with</i> or <i>God</i> can have different applications. <i>One</i> can
mean <u>one individual</u> (John)<i> </i>or<i> </i><u>one corporately</u> (at
the “group” level) as one committee comprised of several individuals. <i>One</i>
can mean <u>united</u> in purpose, values, cooperative effort—so to speak <u>as
one</u> or <u>in harmony with</u>. <i>With</i> (John<b> 1</b>:1) can mean
alongside or intermingled together. <u>God</u> can mean a person or it can mean
a kind of thing: deity (<i>“and the Word was deity/God”</i>).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In the trinity
issue, <i>one</i> is a term that applies to an <u>interpersonal oneness</u>. Consequently,
<u>impersonal</u> examples fall short of what involves Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit working together. Three <u>states</u> of water, three <u>parts</u> of an
egg, three <u>functions/roles</u> of one person (son, father, husband), <i>etc</i>.,
are likewise inadequate for dealing with observed interpersonal behavior. Hence,
Father, Son, Holy Spirit are three-in-one interpersonally at the same time, in the
same enterprise, with the same nature, and in all matters where they operate
together; but they have variant “rank,” variant complementary roles, and are
the on(e)ly persons in the category of deity/Godness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Oneness Within the One Deity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            The oneness of
Father-Son-Spirit is greater than the threeness even as the one flesh of
husband-wife is a greater truth than their distinctness. Father, Son, and
Spirit are one in <u>nature</u> (deity vs. angels, humanity, animals, plants,
or chemicals), <u>purpose</u>, <u>values</u>, <u>corporate unity</u> and <u>common
identity</u> as in complementary roles within their total, common functioning. They
are also the only deity there is (cp. Deuteronomy <b>6</b>:4-5). They are one
in the sense that husband-wife are one—minus, of course, the physical aspect of
humanness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            John <b>14</b>:16 offers
the clearest example of interpersonal co-operation between Father, Son, Spirit
within the one God. They operate in unity, and at the same time there is enough
distinctness between Son and Father for the Son to <u>pray</u> to the Father,
between the Father and Spirit for the Father to <u>send</u> the Spirit, and
between the Son and the Spirit for the Spirit to be called <u>another</u>. Any
conclusion about their relationship and distinctness must incorporate the
features of this passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Saying the things above
is not to claim understanding “the trinity.” It means only that the
relationship between Father, Son, and Spirit is understandable to the point
that revelation speaks. The three-in-oneness is not a mathematical absurdity,
because they are not three in the same sense that they are one. They are not
three before they are one or one before they are three. Likewise, it is not a
mystical idea that we affirm but cannot comprehend at all. To say the least, there
are boundaries on the lack of understandableness in the issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Contrast with Tritheism (a
polytheism with three gods)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            Efforts at explaining
the trinity can be overly affected by concern to avoid the accusation that
Christianity teaches a kind of polytheism. The difference between trinity and
tritheism lies in the oneness of nature rather than in a situation where there
may be levels of deity. There is no idea of sexuality or other kinds of feminine-masculine
differences. Trinity differs also in that the polytheistic deities of old and today
do not operate as one in all things and exhibit a “division of labor” in doing
so. Father, Son, and Spirit are “co-eternal”; scripture does not picture them
as one creating the others. They are holy God in that they are self-consistent
and interpersonally moral (moral attributes). They are all-powerful, all-knowing,
self-existent, and the like (natural attributes). There has never been a deity
like our God.</p>
