style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>God/god</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> refers to ultimate reality. Christianity views God as
eternal, ethical interpersonality with certain other knowable attributes. In
contrast, the ancient nations around Israel as well as peoples living in modern
times have concepts of deity that are incompatible with the biblical
understanding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>A.  <u>Theism</u>. A general term for belief in God,
usually considered transcendent and personal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>B.  <u>Atheism</u>. The <u>dis</u>belief in the
existence of any deity. All reality has one level, non-theistic. God is not a
direction-setting aspect within the universe (panentheism, theistic
naturalism), nor is he transcendent to the universe. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>C.  <u>Agnosticism</u>. <u>Un</u>belief in the
existence of any deity means that neither the nature nor existence of deity is
known or knowable. A person makes no claim as to whether deity exists or not. Agnosticism
is practical atheism; if people not sure there is any God, they will not be
involving God in their choices or actions, nor will they serve and worship him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>D.  <u>Pantheism</u>. All is god, and god is all; <u>God
is the universe</u>. There is no supreme God distinguishable from, or
transcendent to, the rest of reality. Pantheism amounts to atheism in that only
one level of reality exists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>E.   <u>Panentheism</u> [theistic naturalism]. <u>God
is an aspect of the universe</u>; he is part of the natural order. God does not
transcend the rest of reality. He is “immanent” (near) both in distance and
kind. He may be regarded as the “vital urge” expressing itself in evolutionary
sequence, the principle of order with material reality, or the striving for
ideal achievement. Eastern religions generally as well as New Age beliefs are examples
of panentheistic thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sometimes theologians use <i>panentheism</i>
in a formal way to picture God as being locationally inside the universe
without necessarily meaning God is part of that order of things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>F.   <u>God of the Gaps</u>. God is a symbol that represents
the unknown fact that fills in the holes in knowledge. As knowledge increases,
of course, God becomes less, a reducing ideal entity. “God of the gaps” becomes
a label for the as-yet unknown, perhaps unknowable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>G.  <u>Deism</u>. A particular form of theism. God
created the universe with built-in laws for its continued operation. Supernatural
intervention does not occur thereafter. So, miracles and special divine
providence do not happen in response to prayer or otherwise, because God does
not intervene visibly or invisibly to bring such things about. The natural and
relational characteristics of God remain as they are presented in
Judaeo-Christian heritage: he is omnipotent, omniscient, eternal, transcendent,
holy, living, etc.; but God does not relate to his people through intervention.
Loving is compromised as a relational characteristic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>H.  <u>Monolatry</u>. Belief in the existence of many
gods but the worship of one. The gods may be thought of as territorial or
associated with various parts of reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I.    <u>Henotheism</u>. A pantheon of gods whose
supreme God may vary or rotate from time to time. One god is supreme and then
another. The signs of the zodiac may be thought of as exemplifying henotheism.
(In recent usage, <i>henotheism</i> has been used for monolatry, the belief in
many gods but the worship of only one.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>J.   <u>Monotheism</u>. The belief that there is <u>one</u>
transcendent, personal God. Monotheism contrasts with polytheism, the belief in
many gods. It includes monarchianism (next) and Christian trinitarianism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>K.  <u>Monarchianism</u> (unitarianism). God is not
only one but single; he is one person in contrast to a trinity of persons. Monarchianism
has been of two general types:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>      1.   <u>Dynamic monarchianism</u> (adoptionism).
<u>Jesus was human</u>, a man only, not God-man, who was either virgin born or
the physical son of Joseph. The Spirit descended on him at his baptism, when
God adopted him as his special son. The doctrine was held by the Ebionites, a
Jewish sect of the second and third centuries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>      2.   <u>Modalistic monarchianism</u> (Docetism,
Patripassianism, Sebellianism, economic trinity, manifestative trinity). <u>Christ
was divine</u> and indistinguishable from the Father. Father, Son, and Spirit
are three different manifestations of the same one person, an “<u>economic
trinity</u>” rather than a real numerical one. Under this heading also belongs
the idea that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three roles for the same
individual one. Wife, daughter, and mother are three relational roles the same
person has. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the <u>docetic</u> adaptation, Christ’s
body was a phantom in that it had the appearance of flesh, but its real
substance was celestial. He only “seemed” (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>δοκέω</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>) to have
material existence. Incarnation and resurrection did not take place because
matter is evil and spirit is good; so God as good spirit would not have mingled
himself with flesh as evil matter. Even if he had incarnated, he would not have
resurrected back into evil material existence; so resurrection would not have
been desirable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              <u>Patripassianism</u> was the name in
the Western church for what in the Eastern Church was known as <u>Sabellianism</u>,
named after Sabellius, a prominent spokesman for that doctrine. The term <i>patripassianism</i>
means “father suffers” (<i>pater</i> + <i>passio</i>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              <u>Unitarianism</u> conceives of God as
one individual with Christ, perhaps, as functional deity, that is, as a man
called God because he fulfilled the role of deity on earth. He was like
Israel’s judges in Psalm <b>82</b>:6 that God called “gods,” an example Jesus
himself raises when accused of blasphemy (John <b>10</b>:34). In this view, he
was an extension of deity like the ten or so men beyond the Twelve who were
called “apostles” because they served as extensions of the apostolic office and
labored at the apostles’ behest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              A related concept supposes that before
times eternal, God was one individual, one unit; and the Son and the Holy
Spirit separated off “temporarily” for operational purposes during history. In
the end, Son (and Spirit) will “absorb” back into one unit (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:28,
<i>“God may be all in all”</i>). The idea takes a temporary functional
threeness during history and conceives of it as a temporary substantive
threeness during time. Before and after, however, God is one individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the modern setting, the trinity issue
comes up in connection with Jews, Muslims, Unitarians, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and
the United Pentecostal Church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>L. <u>Trinitarianism</u>. The belief that God/deity is
three-in-one. In practical usage, it covers various attempts in Christendom to
verbalize how the three are one at the same time. The “orthodox” view has been
that Father, Son, and Spirit are one in three persons (cp. <i>“Holy, Holy,
Holy,”</i> <i>e.g</i>.). They are three persons with the same nature and
purpose. They form a complementary set. (See the essay on “The Divine
Trinity.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>M. Binitarianism. God the Father and the Son comprise
deity. The Holy Spirit is a word for God’s presence, energy, and assistance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>N.  Tritheism. The idea that there are three separate
Gods that do not form a complementary unity of purpose and operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>O.  <u>Dialecticism</u>. A view of God found in
neo-orthodoxy in which God is said to be wholly other although he is also
wholly for us. Since God is completely different from us, there can be no such
thing as word revelation from him, nor can people be said meaningfully to be
created in the image of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>P.   <u>Polytheism</u>. The belief in and worship of <u>many</u>
gods. Polytheism can involve worship of natural forces and heavenly bodies as
well as the worship of idols and images. There is often a hierarchy among the
gods of a pantheon, and the gods can be territorial or associated with
different features of reality. So, a main weakness of polytheism is that it
gives a fragmented worldview. It is compatible with animism, fetishism, and
idolatry. In Christendom, mariolatry and adoration of the saints psychologically
approach the notion behind polytheism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q.  <u>Idolatry</u>. Idol worship regards the idol as
a symbol or habitation of the deity. Scripture speaks of dumb idols that cannot
do anything, meaning that since what a idols represents does not really exist, only
the idol itself exists. The god is as much the creation of human imagination as
is the statue that depicts the god. The statue ends up being the god or goddess
because it is the only thing that really exists; </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;color:windowtext'>there is</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> no more
available from the god than is available from the statue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The prohibition against the use of idols
to represent Yahveh, the really existing God, probably lies in the fact that
using idols “harms” more than it “helps.” Having something tangible to focus on
might “help” worshipers concentrate their attention, but psychological transfer
occurs from the idol to the god it represents. What the idol enables the
worshiper to focus on distorts the reality it represents. (a) <u>In the person’s
mind the idol destroys the actual nature of the true God</u>. Since the idol
does not act, the god turns out to be inert and passive; the god is not “the
living God.” He is unconcerned about human affairs; he is not a god with “lovingkindness”
toward us. The god is incapable of doing anything about human affairs; he is as
weak as the statue that depicts him; he is not “omnipotent.” The idol is
silent; it is a “dumb idol”; it does not communicate with people. Idols, being
inanimate, cannot represent personhood and, being material, cannot represent
spiritual personhood. They cannot represent personhood, much less interpersonal
experience, especially that between us and God. An idol is dumb; it cannot
communicate (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:2; Habakkuk <b>2</b>:18-19; Psalm <b>115</b>:5).
It is inactive (Isaiah <b>46</b>:7; Jeremiah <b>10</b>:5); it cannot be a
living God. It is material—gold, silver, and stone (cp. Acts <b>17</b>:27-29;
Romans <b>1</b>:22-23; Psalm<b> 115</b>:4-5); it cannot represent what cannot
be “located” and limited (Acts <b>17</b>:24-25). Idolatry does more harm by
perversion than the “good” it might seem to do in focusing attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, since human hands have
fashioned the idol that represents the god, (b)<u> worshipers end up with a
sense of control over the god</u>, which they use to their own ends (cp. Acts <b>17</b>:29b-31a;
cp. the behavior of the Moabite king in Numbers <b>22-24</b>). As artisans
create gods in their own image and after the imaginations of their own heart
(Ezekiel <b>14</b>:7), they also put the god psychologically under their own
control. They can manipulate the god to their own ends. The idol does not know
the thoughts and intents of the worshipers’ hearts; so they can protect themselves
against his knowing their secret thoughts; the god is not an “omniscient” or a
“heart-knowing” God. People can use the god’s greater power to their own
intents without revealing their self-interests. The effect of this tendency is
to externalize the religious experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (c) Perhaps idols were forbidden because <u>they
represent an attempt to supplant faith</u> <u>with sight</u>. People want to
think that the only important things in life are the tangible ones. They want
the apparent certainty that goes with having something material. If the true
invisible God thought it was better to be seen to be worshipped, he could
manifest himself to the worshiper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (d) <u>Syncretism tends also to result
from idolatry</u>. Some representation of another deity can be adopted with the
name of this one, as the Israelites tried to identify Yahveh with the Egyptian
bull-god Apis in the wilderness of Sinai (Exodus<b> 32</b>:4-5).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is a different motivation between
art and an object of worship. Making a representation of an angel, of Christ,
and so on, is not so much the point as making it as an object of adoration and
worship—an object to which a person can bow down. Even in the Old Testament
there were two seraphs in the Holy of Holies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The problem with icons and statues in
Christianity is twofold. In the first place, <b>(1) </b>statues of the <u>saints</u>
are improper because of who they are. Adoration <i>vs</i>. worship is a
psychologically impertinent difference. The Old Testament forbade the bowing
behavior toward them. Secondly, <b>(2) </b>they lack the very characteristics,
and substitute the very characteristics, that statues in general have. No
Christian has ever tried to make a statue of the Father or the Spirit. Even of
Christ Paul says that we no longer know him after the “flesh” (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:16),
which is the nearest thing a statue or picture could represent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>R.  <u>Animism</u>. All discrete objects have
indwelling souls and possess conscious life. These spirits may exist in
disembodied states as well and can possess and oppress people. Animism can
connect with fetishism, described next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>S.   <u>Fetishism</u>. Objects have magic powers that people
can access in various ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>T.   <u>Totemism</u>. Tribes trace their descent from
some ancestral plant or animal origin. It is a primitive form of evolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>U.  All views that theologize God into impersonal
abstraction and reject the idea that God as ontic entity, eternal personal
spirit with certain known and knowable attributes. God is a symbolic
representation of some ideal or principle; he is a projection of human
imagination like Freud’s idea that God is a projection of the father image. </span></p>

in not having a practical effect on human life. Agnosticism amounts to “practical
