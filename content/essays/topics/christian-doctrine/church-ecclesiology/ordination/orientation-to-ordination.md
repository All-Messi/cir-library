I. Ordination is for the one ordained.

Ordination is for impressing on the person ordained the importance of his calling. People set aside time for things that are important. By setting aside time to concentrate on what it means to minister, the body of believers shows the person their regard for that calling. Ordination provides a time to be impressed with the significance of the “ministry of reconciliation,” as Paul called it (2 Corinthians<strong> 5</strong>:18-21).

Ordination is not for empowering a person to do ministry, nor is it for transmitting charismata or gifts. In general, ministers do their work on the basis of inborn talents and developed skills that through conversion become gifts of the Spirit for accomplishing the work of ministry.

Ordination is not for validating someone’s work. Anyone has the right to speak a word to lost people about salvation on behalf of God. They do not need to be licensed for that. In Acts <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:4 Luke indicates that because of the persecution that surrounded the martyrdom of Stephen, Christians in and around Jerusalem scattered and went everywhere preaching the gospel. A person does not need authorization to “administer” ordinances. Paul indicated to the Corinthians that Jesus Christ did not send him to perform baptisms (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:18). Grace does not flow legally through the church’s representatives; it flows directly from God to the individual; it is interpersonal. The ministry is a witness to grace, not a channel of grace.


II. Ordination is for the congregation involved.

Congregations can use opportunities like this to recapture their sense of awareness for the great needs that lie beyond their immediate theater of operation. When they send out one of their own to proclaim the gospel, they demonstrate their desire to fulfill their outward-directed responsibilities to the world at large. In looking beyond themselves, they gain a better understanding of who they are and how they belong to the universal, eternal program of God.


III. Ordination is for the church at large.

In ordaining someone into ministry, the sending congregation makes a statement to the universal body of believers that this person has its approval as to character, commitment, and qualification. The church has a responsibility to continue the close ties of communication and support to fulfill this ongoing responsibility to the body of Christ collect.
