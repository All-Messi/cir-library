<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Across Christendom ordination has had a
variety of meanings. The most extreme position has been that <b>(1)</b>
ordination validates the “administration” of sacraments. Unless a duly
qualified clergyman presides, the sacrament is invalid in much the same way
that a wedding performed by a person “off the street” would not be recognized
by the state. A Justice of the Peace must be duly appointed to perform wedding
ceremonies as an agent of the state. In this view, ordination is for <u>theological
reasons</u>. The clergy concept is part of the larger idea that grace flows
through the church, that is, through those who validly stand as executors of
divine administration. It is a legal conceptualization like that of Justice of
the Peace, validity being based on “apostolic succession.” <u>Legal</u>
administration of <u>grace</u>, however, is a contradiction of terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A more restricted view says that <b>(2) </b>ordination
protects from mis-practice in holy things. The validity of the administration
does not depend on the validity of ordination, but for <u>practical reasons</u>
only ordained ministers preside at the Lord’s table and perform baptisms. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christian ordinances, however, are not
more dependent on clergy than preaching the gospel is, even under concern for
propriety. From a theological standpoint, ordinances are interpersonal in character,
not legal. Consequently, there is no required licensing and ordaining of
ministers. So, if a minister offers to work with a congregation, it is doubtful
that the congregation should ask whether he is ordained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another view is that ordination <b>(3) </b>makes
a statement to the brotherhood at large that the sending congregation
recommends this person from its midst as one with Christian character,
appropriate ministry skills, and acceptable doctrinal perspectives. Such
ordination does not validate his ministry; it indicates recommendation by a
congregation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A final approach sees ordination as a
gesture that <b>(4)</b> appoints to a specific task as long as the person is
performing in that role. When he leaves it for another task, the ordination
does not go with him. Ordination is task specific.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Aside from a statement about character and
qualifications (#3), about the only reason people would seek ordination is to enable
them to perform wedding ceremonies validly (and even that privilege does not
require religious ordination). That is a state matter, because marriage is not
an institution of the church (a sacrament) but an institution of society. Many
states do not require ministerial ordination for performing weddings; the
minister must be “recognized” as a minister. Another benefit is financial because
the United States government does make ministerial housing allowance
non-taxable. These last two elements in ordination have nothing to do with
Christian ministry. They are vestiges of largely bygone days when citizens
regarded clergy in heightened terms because of the authority they were viewed
as having in religious matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ordination is practiced with elders and
deacons in the local congregation, but that is concept #4. In the eyes of the
state and the church, it does not validate being an agent of the state in
performing weddings—although that right has been loosened in more recent
decades. If such persons move to another congregation, they do not take their
ordination with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ordination is done only by congregations, because
ecclesiologically that is the “highest” level of the body of Christ on earth
today. Local autonomy in the free-church tradition has no super-congregational
entity to license or ordain. Parachurch agencies are not part of the
organization of the church collect. They are entities incorporated by individuals
under the <u>state</u> for tax purposes to provide services not considered
manageable by one congregation. Ordination is not done by such agencies: mission
agencies, benevolent agencies, educational institutions, Christian counseling
services. Being taken on staff amounts to the only “ordination” </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>there is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In our culture, for a person to say he is “ordained”
sounds like concept #1 and #2 or perhaps #3. It sounds more prestigious than it
really is since biblical precedents do not carry ordination past concept #3 to
#1 or #2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ordination of women is a function of yet
another issue: the New Testament’s range of role relationships between husbands
and wives in the home and in the church. Appointment to specific tasks (#4) raises
no issue about a woman’s doing would be natural, but that would hardly be what “ordination”
would mean in a typical statement: <i>“She is ordained.”</i> It is questionable
whether New Testament comments about men-women (especially husband-wife) role
relationship simply reflect first-century culture among Jews and Gentiles. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The issue is too complex to handle as part
of the ordination issue. A couple points do seem clear. The structure of the
church must be compatible with the structure of the home. Since home and church
cover the full range of life issues, they both operate at the level of the
whole. That the husband has final responsibility for the operation and success
of home seems clear. To reverse this by putting a wife ahead of her husband in
religious affairs in the church seems to conflict with his responsibility at home,
that is, in the family. At least the most ultimate responsibilities in the
church belong to husbands, it would seem. We are not forgetting here that by
and large the day-to-day functioning of home, business, church, and the like, goes
forward as much as possible through interpersonal influence and mutual respect.
But in group activity authority to fulfill group responsibility is superimposed
on purely interpersonal operations for the sake of efficiency, order, or resolution
in cases of differing opinions about procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As regards ordination, then, it would not
seem natural to ordain (in traditional terms) women to final leadership
ministry in the church. That would specifically put them “above” their
husbands. If it were just a matter of public speaking, it would not be
particularly an issue, depending on how it was done. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>We have</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'> biblical precedent for such activity. But ministry (hence traditional
ordination) involves a broader range of operations than public exhortation and
encouragement. As practiced today at least, ministry includes administrative and
doctrinal decisions, which means needing to exercise authority over general
membership. It approaches the role of elder, and many congregations include the
minister as one of the elders after he has served with the church for a time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Hopefully these thoughts will prove useful
in thinking through the matters involved.</span></p>
