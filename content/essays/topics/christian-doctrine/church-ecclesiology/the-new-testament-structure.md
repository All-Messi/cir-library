style='font-size:12.0pt'>         This chapter sketches the original organization
of the church in the New Testament. It determines what positions exercised
authority and which were functions, all being places of service. The procedure works
because it addresses an either-or matter and because authority includes
function. We cannot suppose that a <u>function</u> seemed to be such only
because the records happen to be insufficient to show that it was really an <u>office</u>.
That would argue from silence and shift the burden of proof onto the negative. The
negative burden would be impossible since the only available evidence would
pertain to function, which is part of the larger concept: office.</span></p>

Savior and Lord (Ephesians <b>5</b>:23; Titus.<b> 1</b>:4; 2 Peter <b>2</b>:20;
<b>3</b>:2, 18) in that order (Ephesians <b>1</b>:20 + 21-23; Philippians <b>2</b>:5-8

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         The second place of service in the church is
apostle [</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀπόστολος</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>apostolos</i>].<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'> </span>In the New Testament, more than twenty-five men bear the
label <i>apostle</i> in sense of missionary, “one sent.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>2</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Of these,
fourteen may be singled out as apostles in an added special sense, (a) having
in common certain distinguishing marks and (b) being perceived as peculiar from
the rest.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> The distinguishing
mark of the original Twelve, Matthias, and Paul was (1) their being personally
chosen by Christ as (2) special eyewitnesses of his resurrection.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> The combination of these two elements
is important: over five hundred could bear witness to the fact itself; but they
were not all officially chosen, appointed, endowed, commissioned, and guided;
many preached the resurrection who had not seen it. If there had been no
difference between the apostleship of “the Twelve” and that of others called
“apostles,” there would have been no more reason formally to replace Judas than
any one of the others,<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> who
are not known ever to have been replaced in this manner. Paul’s manner of
sending and calling the others who are called apostles indicates a difference
between himself and them (Colossians <b>4</b>:7-11; 2 Timothy <b>4</b>:9-13,
20-21; Titus <b>3</b>:12-13; Philemon 8-9). Finally, no one except the Twelve plus
Paul ever refers to <u>himself</u> as an apostle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         That the Twelve were perceived as a special
group comes in the very references to them as “the Twelve” (Matthew <b>10</b>:1-2;
John<b> 6</b>:67, 70, 71; <b>20</b>:24), then “the eleven” after Judas Iscariot
committed suicide (Matthew <b>28</b>:16; Mark <b>16</b>:14; Luke <b>24</b>:9,
33; Acts<b> 1</b>:26), and then “the Twelve” again after the selection of
Matthias (Acts <b>6</b>:2). John <b>20</b>:24 is significant in that “the Twelve”
occurs in a passage where the number had been reduced by the death of Judas. Paul
conceived of himself as equal with the most important apostles (Galatians <b>1-2</b>)
and was accepted by them in this capacity (Galatians <b>2</b>:8-9). Since Paul
was also accounted an apostle in the technical sense, there were “twelve”
apostles in the same sense as there were “twelve” tribes of Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Characteristics</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Authoritative</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>—As
we view the <u>reason for</u>, and the <u>nature of</u>, supervisory authority,
it is obvious that the highest rank in an authoritative system is authoritative,
at least as long as the ultimate authority is away. This axiom is true because,
if authority is needed at all, it is needed for the orderly and efficient operation
where the system is functioning. The church partakes of authority by virtue of
its head, who has authority. His appointment of the apostles gave them the final
earthly leadership during his absence.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>6 </span>So what they did he “authorized” them to do, and what they
were authorized to do involved supervising the activities of others. In
addition to making converts, they disciplined and set them in order. Christ’s
authority not only passed down <u>to</u> them as functionaries, but down <u>through</u>
them as officers. Since his authority was always passing through them, and
since he himself was absent during their whole ministry, we may say that
authority inhered <u>in</u> the apostleship itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         As we view the <u>functioning</u> of
authority, the right to lead based on <u>service performed</u> (1 Corinthians<b>
9</b>:7) is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the right to lead based on <u>authority
given</u> (Matthew <b>28</b>:18-19). Particularly this is the case with church
leadership, where authoritative right always includes service right. Moreover,
certain passages describe church authority as exclusive of “lordship,” as when
Jesus says that his apostles are not to exercise lordship the way the kings of
the Gentiles do—lording it over their subjects.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>7</span> Such statements, however, involve a pejorative use of “lordship”;
because Jesus who had the <u>authority of Lord</u> (John<b> 13</b>:13)
conducted himself in the <u>attitude of Servant</u> (Luke <b>22</b>:25). They
strike at the <u>motives</u> of the <u>person</u> rather than the <u>fact</u>
of his <u>authority</u>, the <u>manner</u> of using rather than the <u>right</u>
to use. Even when authority is present, the operation of the office moves
forward as much as possible by interpersonal factors. If rightful authority
includes able service, no one minds being subject to it. The question is not so
much <u>what</u> is done, but the <u>basis</u> on which it is done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Certain statements in Paul’s writings seem to
presuppose a right to lead on the basis of authority given. In connection with <u>disciplining</u>
the Corinthians, he uses language that would seem presumptuous outside the
context of a recognized formal authority. Among these instances is 1
Corinthians <b>4</b>:21, where he asks whether they would have him come <i>“with
a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness.”</i> Note the otherwise idle and
boastful threat in 2 Corinthians <b>13</b>:2, <i>“If I come again, I will not
spare”</i> (cp. 2 Corinthians<b> 1</b>:23; <b>10</b>:8-11; <b>13</b>:10). The
right to discipline has legal implications, but Paul wanted to handle problems
in personal love. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         One <u>commanding situation</u> in Paul also
brings up the distinction between his right in Christ and his preference for
beseeching in love. He says regarding his desire to keep another man’s slave, <i>“Though
I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin what is appropriate; yet for the sake
of love I beseech instead . . . that your goodness be not of necessity, but of
free will”</i> (Philemon 8-14); Paul had confidence in Philemon’s “obedience”
(21). He used the strong verb </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>διατάσσω</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<i>diatassō</i>)
in 1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:1 in reference to his “instructing” the churches of
Galatia about the offering. The case for formal right should not be pushed too
far in connection with commanding statements, because the commanding idea
itself says nothing about official right over someone else, as is obvious in
Gamaliel’s “command” to fellow members of the Sanhedrin (Acts<b> 5</b>:34-40). The
same may be said of <i>“setting in order”</i> (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:34; cf.
Titus <b>1</b>:5). Even Paul’s foregone right to command support (1
Thessalonians<b> 2</b>:6-9; 2 Thessalonians <b>3</b>:8-9) does not rest on more
than the right of service (1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:7-19); yet in the case of
Onesimus, the slave of Philemon, right by grant may be intended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         The apostles’ <u>appointment</u> of the seven
in Acts <b>6</b>:1-7 indicates supervisory authority, especially since they
took the initiative in this new matter (cp. Acts <b>14</b>:23; contrast Titus <b>1</b>:5).
These observations on the functioning of the apostleship <u>confirm</u> the
fact that the Lord himself appointed them as authoritative leaders with
responsibility for establishing the church during his absence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>General</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>––In
commissioning the apostles, Jesus sent them to the whole world, to every
nation, to every classification of mankind (Matthew<b> 28</b>:19; Mark <b>16</b>:15,
20; Luke <b>24</b>:47; Acts <b>1</b>:8). Recounting their triumphant
establishment of the universal church in a hostile world, the Book of Acts
traces the spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome, emphasizing the apostle
to the circumcision and the apostle to the Gentiles (cp. Galatians<b> 2</b>:8).
According to Galatians<b> 2</b>:7-10, Peter and Paul concentrated respectively
on the circumcision and the uncircumcision, a complete listing from the Jewish
viewpoint (cp. Ephesians <b>2</b>:11ff,<i> etc</i>.). Paul speaks of his
anxiety for all the church<u>es</u> (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:28; cp. 1
Corinthians<b> 4</b>:17; <b>7</b>:17;<b> 16</b>:1). In the New Testament canon,
the apostles directed their letters to individuals, churches, and territories
in broad range throughout the northern Mediterranean: Syria, Asia Minor,
Greece, and Italy. The scope of the apostolic ministry was as wide as the scope
of the Christian gospel. Apostleship is therefore a general office. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Usage of the word <i>elder</i></span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>––A third place of service in the church is elder, or
presbyter. Of the seventy-five times </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<i>presbyteros</i>) and its cognates occur in the New
Testament, sixteen are clear references to an office in the church. Other
usages refer to apostles (3), Jewish elders (33), men of old (1), old men (10),
and the twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse (12).<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>8</span> The word has a general and a technical denotation. In
technical references to the office of elder, the word retains something of its
meaning “older.” In 1 Peter <b>5</b>:1-5, Peter urges the <u>younger</u> to defer
to the <u>elder</u>, who had responsibility for, and over, the flock; hence,
the eldership is an office of personal Christian maturity.  </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Equation of elder and bishop</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>––<i>Bishop</i> (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐπίσκοπος</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>episkopos</i>)
is another term the New Testament uses for the office of elder. The <u>primary
evidence</u> for equating them is the interchangeable use of <i>elder</i> and <i>bishop</i>
in common reference. Two contexts provide the evidence for equating them. In
Acts <b>20</b> the Ephesian <u>elders</u> (<b>20</b>:17) are to watch out for
the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made them <u>bishops</u> (<b>20</b>:28).
Luke calls them <i>elders</i>; Paul calls them <i>bishops</i>. In Titus <b>1</b>,
Paul explains that he left Titus in Crete to appoint <u>elders</u> (<b>1</b>:5),
men blameless in their domestic relations because <u>bishops</u> (<b>1</b>:7)
must be blameless as God’s stewards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              The two terms are not used in a way that
puts one within the other, as if bishop were a narrower category than elder. In
Acts <b>20</b>:17 and 28, the historian and the apostle refer to the same <u>group
of people</u>; in Titus <b>1</b>:5-9 Paul lists qualifications for <u>one
office</u>. <i>Bishop</i> and <i>elder</i> do not just appear in the same
context; they appear interchangeably in the same context with reference to the
same predicate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              In conformity with Paul’s interchange of
“bishop” and “elder” in Acts <b>20</b> and Titus <b>1</b>, Paul gives a <u>common
description</u> of elder and bishop. He says in 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:4-5<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9 </span>concerning a bishop that he must
be <i>“a person who <u>rules</u></i> [</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>proistēmi</i>] <i>his
household well, having children in <u>subjection</u></i> [</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὑποταγή</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>hypotagē</i>]
<i>with all respectfulness; if a man does not know how to <u>rule</u></i> [</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>]
<i>his own house, how will he <u>take care of</u></i> [</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐπιμελέομαι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>epimeleomai</i>]
<i>the church of God?”</i> <b>(a)</b> The qualifications laid down in Titus 1
under the double label “elder-bishop” parallel the ones here under the single
label “bishop.” <b>(b)</b> 1 Timothy <b>3</b> speaks of the “ruling-caring for”
idea in connection with the work of “bishops” and later associates it with that
of “elders” in <b>5</b>:17, <i>“Let the elders that <u>rule</u> </i>[</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>]
<i>well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who work in word
and teaching.”</i> Working <i>“in word and teaching”</i> (<b>5</b>:17) also
parallels <b>3</b>:2, which stipulates that a candidate be “able to teach.” While
requiring high personal and domestic characteristics for deacons in <b>3</b>:8-13,
Paul does not require of them the ability to teach or the responsibility of
“ruling” the church as he does of bishops (<b>3</b>:2, 4-5), and these are the
two elements joined together in <b>5</b>:17. <b>(c) </b>Finally, Paul combines
bishops and deacons in Philippians <b>1</b>:1 as in 1 Timothy<b> 3</b>, where
“bishop” in turn equals the “bishop-elder” of Titus <b>1</b>. He seems to have
had the same position in mind in Titus <b>1</b>:5-9 (bishop-elder), 1 Timothy 3
(bishop), 1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:17ff. (elder), and Philippians <b>1</b>:1
(bishop).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              In further confirmation of the identity
of eldership and bishopric, there is no New Testament unit of immediate context
that ever mentions bishops and elders together to imply distinctness.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Primary evidence for equation lies in
(1) the interchangeableness of terms in common reference, confirmed by (2)

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Equation of elder-bishop and pastor</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>—Perhaps on the background of Zechariah<b> 13</b>:7, <i>“I
will strike the Shepherd and the sheep will scatter”</i> (cp. Matthew<b> 26</b>:3
= Mark <b>14</b>:27), Jesus pictures his disciples as a flock, especially in
John (also in Matthew<b> 9</b>:36 = Mark <b>6</b>:34; Matthew <b>25</b>:32). Paul
mentions pastors in Ephesians<b> 4</b>:11 among the ministries Christ gave
after his ascension. <i>Pastor</i>, or <i>shepherd</i> (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ποιμήν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>poimēn</i>),
appears only twice more outside the gospels, both times in reference to Christ
(Hebrews <b>13</b>:20; 1 Peter<b> 2</b>:25). The question arises then as to
what a pastor is in Paul’s list of ministries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Two contexts shed light on the ministry
indicated in Ephesians<b> 4</b>:11: Acts <b>20</b>:17-35 and 1 Peter <b>5</b>:1ff.
In both places the shepherding metaphor combines with the elder-bishop
terminology discussed above. The elders of Ephesus (Acts <b>20</b>:17) were to

summary, the New Testament uses four terms to refer to one role: <i>elder</i>, <i>bishop</i>,

rests primarily on (a) full interchange of terminology with the same reference
in Acts <b>20</b>:17-35 and Titus <b>1:</b>5-6, confirmed by (b) common
description (didactic, authoritative, and local) and (c) lack of distinguishing
reference in combination. <u>Elder-bishop then equates with pastor</u> in that
(a) pastoring is an expressive figure for the prominent responsibilities of
elder-bishop (ruling and teaching); (b) the pastoring metaphor describes the
elder-bishop’s work; and (c) Paul omits elder-bishop in the one place where
pastor describes a church office. <u>Elder-bishop-pastor evidently equals <i>teacher</i></u>
in Ephesians <b>4</b>:11 and 1 Corinthians<b> 12</b>:28, 29 since in the first
passage <i>teacher</i> forms with <i>pastor</i> a hyphenated expression that
parallels <i>teacher</i> standing alone in the second.</span></p>

example of elder (= bishop-pastor-teacher) is local; every local church whose

elders existed in every area whose evangelization the New Testament records:
Jerusalem, cities of southern Asia Minor, cities of northern Asia Minor,
Ephesus, Philippi, cities of Crete, as well as perhaps Rome, Antioch, and
Thessalonica.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>18</span> <i>Bishop</i>

reference, the word clearly designates elders only in 1 Timothy <b>5</b>:17.

shows it was resident in the elders.</span></p>

references in Hebrews are unclear, but Acts<b> 15</b>:22 refers to Judas
Barsabas and Silas, who were perhaps elders in the Jerusalem church.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>20</span> The word can indicate authority
as Luke <b>22</b>:26 demonstrates, where it contrasts to </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>διακονέω</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> and
compares with </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>κυριεύω</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>              </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>Ποιμαίνω</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, “to shepherd,” carries
two meanings that correspond to a shepherd’s work: feeding and ruling.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>21</span> The word refers to church
offices only in Acts <b>20</b>:28 and I Peter <b>5</b>:2: <i>“feed the

include authority, but none of them necessarily do so. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              B. Another strand of evidence occurs in
the <u>comparisons</u> used with eldership. In 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:5 Paul draws
a parallel between the home and the church when he says, <i>“If a man does not
know how to rule his own home, how will he take care of God’s church?”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>22</span> A man’s responsibility as head
of the home is more than a <u>comparison</u> with his work as church leader. The
one is an <u>example</u> of the other because real elements are common to both.
(1) Authority is involved in being head of the <u>home</u>, an authority like
Christ’s as head of the <u>church</u> (Ephesians <b>5</b>:22-23). More
importantly, (2) connecting father and elder establishes a model by which to
think of the eldership and gives a feel for the way an elder is to carry his
authority in the church: as a loving father does in the home and as Christ does
in the church. Finally, (3) it puts the headship in the context of service. As
Christ is both Savior and Lord, so a husband is helper and head, and an elder
is servant and ruler.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>23                     </span>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              C. A third strand of evidence for the
eldership as an authoritative office comes in certain examples of <u>operation</u>.
The relief offering from Antioch was sent to the elders (Acts<b> 11</b>:30)
even though men had been chosen to distribute relief goods (Acts<b> 6</b>:1-6).
This is similar to the previous practice in Jerusalem of laying offerings at
the apostles’ feet (Acts<b> 4</b>:35, 37; <b>5</b>:2) though they did not
distribute them (Acts <b>6</b>:2). That procedure pictures the apostles and
later the elders as men responsible for work they did not themselves perform: supervisory
authority. The Conference on Circumcision in Acts<b> 15</b> shows the elders
gathering with the apostles to consider the problem raised by certain men who
had gone out from Jerusalem preaching to Gentiles the necessity of circumcision
and allegiance to the Law of Moses. They deliberated the problem with the
apostles and joined in an official statement on behalf of the Jerusalem church
that these Judaizing teachers had gone out on their own. Paul’s summons to the
Ephesian elders in Acts <b>20</b> likewise implies that these men were the
responsible leaders of the church there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              In summary, evidence for authority in
the eldership comes from appropriate word associations confirmed by example. These
related strands of data are particularly close in 1 Timothy. Speaking of
elders’ qualifications in <b>3</b>:5, the apostle parallels the home and the
church. This parallel involves </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, a potential authority word applied to husbands in<b>
3</b>:4, 5 and to elders in <b>5</b>:17. Having made the parallel between home
and church as regards leadership, Paul applies the same potential authority
term to both husband and elder in close context. Under such circumstances we expect
continuity of meaning. Authority is an ingredient in being head of the home;
hence, it is in the church. The ability to use authority in combination with
other, dynamic factors is common to both institutions, and success at using it
in one is presumptive evidence for the ability to use it in the other. (1)
Potential authority <u>words</u> are applied to elders and to (2) certain
illustrative <u>comparisons</u> like shepherding and being a husband; (3)
elders in their <u>operation</u> demonstrate authoritative leadership.<span

to indicate that they exercised supervisory authority over their hearers. This
picture accords well with that of the Old Testament prophets who stood as

Authority resided not in a <u>position</u> in the nation’s political structure,
but in the prophet’s <u>message</u> from God. Likewise, church prophets
ministered, not from a position of <u>authority</u>, but from a gift of <u>revelation</u>.
With no example of supervisory authority and no appropriate principle for invoking

appear as communicators of messages from God. Sometimes their prophecy was <u>predictive</u>,
as with Agabus concerning the famine (Acts<b> 11</b>:27-28) and the bondage of
Paul (Acts<b> 21</b>:10-11). More often it was <u>communication</u>. Paul’s
admonitions to prophets in 1 Corinthians <b>14</b> focus on the importance of
prophesying as distinguished from speaking in languages without communicating a
message. This prophesying, however, has a different emphasis from teaching
because prophets and teachers are listed side by side.<span style='position:

reference to divine endowment, or revelation: <i>“But if something is revealed
to one who is seated, let the first be silent”</i> (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:30).
Whether special prediction or general communication, prophesying looks at the
origin of the divine message more than at the dispensing of the divine message
itself.</span></p>

their Old Testament counterparts, New Testament prophets <u>as prophets</u>
were potential for general function. Their ministry had general application
because neither predicting nor revealing is local perforce. Accordingly,
prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch (Acts <b>11</b>:27; <b>15</b>:22,
27, 32) and to Caesarea (Acts <b>21</b>:10) <u>as prophets</u>. Judas and Silas
were either elders or general members at Jerusalem (Acts <b>15</b>:22), but
they went to Antioch and functioned there <u>as prophets</u>. Indeed, there
were prophets “<u>in</u> the church” at Antioch (Acts <b>13</b>:1). Furthermore,
Agabus lived in Judaea from the time of Acts <b>11</b>:27 to <b>21</b>:10—over
fifteen years; but these men could, and did, move outside their normal area of
service from time to time. Prophets were <u>potential</u> for general function.</span></p>

the apostles and elders in Jerusalem (<b>15</b>:3, 4, 6, 22, 23; <b>16</b>:4),

not necessarily formal; whether anyone presided we cannot determine from the

correcting the difficulty, and that was done by consensus. Although Paul and
Barnabas took part in the discussion, the final action was taken, not by the
group conjointly, but by Jerusalem only because it was from Jerusalem that the
Judaizing teachers had tried to spread their understanding of how Gentiles
should incorporate among the followers of Jesus Messiah (<b>15</b>:22-29, 33). It
was not a council.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

to deal with a problem at the source of the <u>problem</u>, not at the “source”
of the <u>church</u>. They conferred with Jerusalem rather than Caesarea or
Samaria because the Judaizing teachers had come from Jerusalem (<b>15</b>:2,
24). Going to the source in this instance was especially expedient. What
Jerusalem taught would be highly influential since the other apostles labored
there. Disagreement among the apostles or between these two churches would be
disquieting to Gentile converts everywhere because Antioch was a center of
Gentile missions (<b>13</b>:1ff.). What affected them would have repercussions
beyond them (<b>15</b>:23; <b>16</b>:4).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Paul and the others went to Jerusalem <b>(2)</b>
to clear up a misunderstanding, not to decide on a doctrine. The Christians in
Antioch had no way of knowing whether Jerusalem had approvingly sent the
Judaizing teachers. Dealing with the problem openly (a) exonerated Jerusalem in
the eyes of Antioch, (b) dispelled the fear that the two churches disagreed on
basic doctrine; and (c) provided a public occasion for the Jerusalem church
generally to hear the discussion and dissuade others of them from similar
deviations. (d) The conference made the Jerusalem leadership aware that men had
gone out from them with this doctrine<i>: “. . . we have heard . . .”</i> (<b>15</b>:24).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

about their message. Antioch had always taken that position (Acts <b>11</b>:19-26).
God had confirmed their ministry by miraculous credentials (<b>15</b>:12). They
were joyfully announcing the conversion of the Gentiles (<b>15</b>:3) even on
the way to the Conference. The issue was not new or unsettled from the
precedent in Cornelius’ conversion (<b>15</b>:7-11; <b>10</b>:1-<b>11</b>:18). Amos
prophesied that the Gentiles (as Gentiles) would seek God and be called by his name
(<b>15</b>:13-18; Amos<b> 9</b>:11-12). The Judaizers were subverting souls (<b>15</b>:24);
scripture and precedent had settled the matter.<span style='position:relative;

from the Mosaic Law (<b>15</b>:29; cp. 20); it explained that Jerusalem had not

original pattern of the church according to the evidence outlined in the
preceding pages. The lines represent the flow of authority from Christ through
the other levels of organization. Evangelist and prophet are general functions
under the apostles. When they work locally, they are under the local leadership
and are not themselves authoritative offices. All the general offices are universal
offices. The structure of the church universal in the first century was not
elaborate.</span></p>

the opposite view that all the apostles fulfilled their missionary calling by

in the special sense includes all the general meaning as well. There are two
reasons that more than fourteen men are called <i>apostles</i>. <b>(1) </b>The
first is the missionary concept the term. The activity to which it refers is
the same as that of evangelist, the two words arising from different aspects of
the whole activity: the “being sent” and the “good news” the men declared. <b>(2)</b>
Several of these men as members of the Pauline circle were extensions of the
apostolic office and so bore the name of the office they were representing.</span></p>

Christ’s personal choice of <u>the Twelve</u> is recorded in Matthew <b>10</b>:1-4;
Mark <b>3</b>:13-19; Luke <b>6</b>:12-16; John <b>6</b>:70; <b>13</b>:18 (<b>15</b>:16-17);
Acts <b>1</b>:2 + 13; <b>10</b>:41; of <u>Matthias</u> in Acts <b>1</b>:23-26 (<i>“Lord

<b>13</b>:2;<b> 20</b>:24; <b>26</b>:16; Galatians <b>1</b>:1, 16; 1 Timothy <b>1</b>:1
(cp. Titus <b>1</b>:3). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              <b>(2)</b> Seeing the resurrected Christ
is mentioned as a qualification in Acts <b>1</b>:22 (<i>“witness with us of the
resurrection”</i>; cp. Luke <b>24</b>:44-48; Acts <b>1</b>:1-8;<b> 2</b>:32; <b>3</b>:15;
<b>4</b>:19-20, 33 “<u>their</u> witness”; <b>5</b>:32; <b>9</b>:17; <b>10</b>:39,

+ 1 John <b>1</b>:1; 1 Peter <b>5</b>:1 + 2 Peter <b>1</b>:16-21). In 1
Corinthians <b>9</b>:1, Paul associates his apostleship with seeing the Lord
(probably meaning the resurrected Lord, though he may have seen Christ before).
The Damascus experience was an objective event because Paul’s companions heard
Christ’s voice (Acts <b>22</b>:9; </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀκούω</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>[<i>akouō</i>]
+ acc.) without understanding it (Acts <b>9</b>:7 </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀκούω</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>+ gen.) and saw the light (Acts<b> 22</b>:9). Paul
himself was physically blinded by the brightness of the light (<b>22</b>:6,
11). It was the kind of seeing and hearing that enabled Paul to be a <u>witness</u>
of what he had seen and heard (Acts<b> 22</b>:14-15), <i>witness </i>being a
peculiar word for the apostolic mission. Furthermore, in a table of
post-resurrection appearances, Paul lists himself last in parallel to the
incidents in the gospels (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:1-8). Galatians <b>2</b>:7-8
makes evident that Paul was an apostle in the same sense as the Twelve. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Other distinguishing marks of the
apostles were<b> (3) </b>receiving their message directly from Christ through
the Holy Spirit rather than through other men (John <b>16</b>:13-15; Acts <b>1</b>:8;
Galatians <b>1</b>:11-12; Ephesians <b>3</b>:1-13; 1 Timothy <b>1</b>:11); </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              <b>(4)</b> being endowed directly with
miraculous power (Acts <b>2</b>) rather than through the laying on of hands
(Acts <b>8</b>:14-19) or perhaps prayer (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:14?); </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         <b>     (5)</b> being each one supernaturally
endowed with the whole range of miraculous manifestation rather than with different
gifts (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28-31). The apostles were direct witnesses,
directly chosen, informed, and endowed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              <b>(6)</b> A secondary element mentioned
in Acts <b>1</b>:22-23––companying with Christ during his ministry (cp. Mark <b>3</b>:4)––probably
has the force of not being a novice (cp. 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:6). Paul fits even
this stipulation, at least in spirit. He was not a novice when he began his
apostolic work, because ten to fourteen years had intervened before his first
missionary journey.</span></p>

selection of Matthias accorded with divine sanction. Luke gives no reason to
question it, recounting the use of scripture (Psalm <b>69</b>:25 and <b>109</b>:8)

endowment of chapter <b>2</b> as well as the choice by the Lord in <b>1</b>:23-26.</span></p>

following comments issue from a Pauline authorship framework despite frequent
rejection of the pastorals as genuine products of the apostle himself. Among
the writers on this question, Donald Guthrie represents those who favor Pauline
authorship; see <i>The Pastoral Epistles: An Introduction and Commentary </i>in<i>
The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries</i>, Vol. II: <i>New Testament
Introduction</i>, pp. 198-236. Introductions by R. K. Harrison, Theodor Zahn,
H. C. Thiessen, and others take the same side of the issue. P. N. Harrison, in <i>The
Problem of the Pastoral Epistles</i>, presents the case for denial of Pauline
authorship, especially from linguistic data.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              A decision against Pauline authorship
does not materially affect the point we are making; it may add weight to the
argument because non-Pauline authorship corresponds with a later date of
writing. The synonyms “elder” and “bishop” in the pastorals would then stand in
more direct opposition to the later tendency to distinguish them by the same
generations that were involved in formally delimiting the canon.</span></p>

those gathered at Mary’s house to tell “James and the brothers” about his
release (Acts <b>12</b>:17). Paul went up to Jerusalem and visited <i>“James, and

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The point here is the way a ministry is <u>viewed</u>
as well as the way it <u>operates</u>. Over a period of fifteen years, a man
may serve as elder in three churches; an evangelist during the same period of
time might minister in three localities. The difference is that eldership
arises from <u>within</u> a local community of believers; an evangelist comes
from <u>without</u>. The evangelist circuits <u>as an evangelist</u>, but an
elder <u>as an elder</u> does not. When he changes residence, he does not automatically
become an elder in the second church; he first identifies himself as a part of
that community and may later be chosen to serve as an elder there. The
evangelist changes residence because he has changed ministry; the elder changes
ministry because he has changed residence. As they work, elders and evangelists
may do many of the same things.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>         <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>27</span>Appointment
differs from selection if Acts<b> 6</b>:3 is any indication of the process. Titus
may be viewed as conducting the installation for which he exhorted them to make
selections. The President is sworn in by the Chief Justice, but he is not under
the authority of the latter.</span></p>

Titus<b> 2</b>:15 Paul tells Titus to rebuke with all authority (</span><span

The right to do such may rest on (a) service rendered, (b) the truth involved,
or (c) the position held. The last of these coincides with office. Paul
probably has the second of these in mind since he is speaking of general moral
matters.</span></p>

the modern day, the activity of evangelist is adjusted as a result of the
absence of the apostles so that he can no longer serve as an extension of an

Romans <b>16</b>:1, however, could be used in the descriptive, non-official sense
of “worker.” In 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:11 </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>γυναῖκας</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> could be taken in its
usual meaning of “wives” (<i>i.e</i>., of the deacons), as the Authorized
Version translates: “their wives.” Calvin and others understand 1 Timothy <b>5</b>
in reference, not necessarily to widows serving as “deaconesses,” but to widows
supported by the church. In 1 Timothy <b>3</b> Paul is talking about selecting
persons; in 1 Timothy <b>5 </b>he is talking about accepting applicants.
Relevant passages among early Christian writers are Tertullian, <i>On the
Veiling of Virgins</i> 9 (A.D. 200); <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> <b>3</b>:7,

depending on the accompanying article, we are tempted in 1 Timothy<b> 3</b>:8

after A.D. 49, Galatians <b>2</b>:1-10 is often considered another account of

W. Farar in <i>The Story of St. Paul</i>, p. 253, though himself an archdeacon
in the Church of England, agreed here, <i>“The so-called Council of Jerusalem
in no way resembles the General Councils of the Church, either in its history,
its constitution, or its object. It was not a convention of ordained delegates,
but a meeting of the entire Church of Jerusalem to receive a deputation from
the Church at Antioch.”</i></span></p>

break may perhaps be made after <b>15</b>:5 to eliminate the statement about

an open, informal, unofficial discussion.</span></p>

expresses the conclusion inherent in matters mentioned previously. James seems
to be “answering” in <b>15</b>:13 the proposition of the Pharisees in<b> 15</b>:5
and so is addressing them more than those with whom he agreed. Peter seems to
be addressing the Pharisees also when he says to his antagonists, <i>“So now
why are you tempting God by laying on the neck of the disciples a yoke that
neither our fathers nor we were strong enough to carry?”</i> The <i>“coming to
one accord”</i> in <b>15</b>:25 may mean doctrinal accord between the Pharisees
and the others, or procedural accord as to what to do to counteract their
influence.  </span></p>

for authoritative proclamation of rulers (Luke<b> 2</b>:1; Acts <b>17</b>:7)
and for authoritative elements of law (Ephesians<b> 2</b>:15; Colossians <b>2</b>:14).
Authority in such cases comes from the <u>circumstance of usage</u>, to which we

Peter’s terminology in <b>15</b>:10, where he speaks of laying on the yoke of
law. The “laying on” in <b>15</b>:28 stands therefore in contrast to, and less
than, the laying on of law. <i>“No greater burden than these necessary things”</i>
(<b>15</b>:28-29) refers to matters of morality true even before the Law or the
gospel, as distinguished from a positive ordinance like circumcision, whereby a
man became debtor to do the whole Law (Galatians <b>5</b>:3). The yoke of faith
(<b>15</b>:11), which is <u>taken</u> on, is easier, lesser, lighter (Matthew <b>11</b>:29-30)
than the yoke of law and may be laid on by charismatic proclamation aside from
supervisory authority both in the initial acceptance and subsequent obedience. Since
those who had gone out from Jerusalem were involved in doctrinal error,
something had to be said about Jerusalem’s position on the matters involved<i>.
“In contrast to what the Judaizing teachers have laid on you, we lay on you
only these necessary things.”</i> No positive argument for authoritative,
conciliar action can come from Acts <b>15</b>:28.</span></p>
