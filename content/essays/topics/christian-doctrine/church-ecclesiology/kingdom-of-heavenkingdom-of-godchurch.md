In the above chart, “kingdom of heaven” occurs in all the Matthew references except for the five places where “(K of G)” appears after the entry: <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:33; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:28; <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:24; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:31, 43. “His kingdom” appears in <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:28, and “Father’s kingdom” is in <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:29. All the passages in Mark, Luke, and John say “kingdom of God” in the references indicated.

Bold-faced print with underlining appears wherever Matthew parallels the other synoptics and shows “kingdom of heaven” at the same place they say “kingdom of God.”  There are nine examples of such parallels. An additional three places (shown in brackets) are not clearly parallel occasions, but they have similar wordings except for “kingdom of heaven/God.”

Matthew <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:23-24 uses both designations for the kingdom in the scope of two verses in a repeated statement that contains one title one time and the other title the second time.

Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:18 joins “kingdom of heaven” and “church” in the same flow of thought. As a result, “kingdom of heaven,” “kingdom of God,” and “church” are three terms for the same thing.


Matthew may have had a couple different reasons for his practice. Perhaps (1) he was trying to emphasize the transcendent, interpersonal, spiritual nature of the kingdom in contrast to the earthly, political kingdom the Jews had been expecting the Messiah to establish. Another suggestion has been that (2) he was using “heaven” as a substitute for “God” in much the way the prodigal son spoke of “sinning against heaven” (Luke<strong> 15</strong>:18, 24). Such usage would not necessarily have been trying to avoid offending the sensitivities of contemporary Judaism in the use of the divine name. It could have become a habitual way of speaking. The other gospels show no particular concern to avoid the term “God,” although they as well as the rest of the New Testament writings do follow current custom by using the Greek word “Lord” (κύριος) in place of the personal name (יהוה, Yahveh, the tetragrammaton), which had become ineffable in Jewish minds. The sense that Matthew’s gospel was aimed more deliberately at a Jewish audience may have made this practice more natural, but it would not have required it.
