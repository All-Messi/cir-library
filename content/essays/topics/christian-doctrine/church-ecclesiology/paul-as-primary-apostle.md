<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
31.5pt;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Some have questioned
whether Paul belonged to the primary group of Jesus’ followers called “apostles.”
During the early years of the Christian era, the Judaizing element in the
church attempted <b>(1)</b> on doctrinal grounds to put him in secondary
position. They tried to create the impression that he stood at odds with the
primary apostles, those centering around Peter in Jerusalem. Judaizers believed
that Gentile converts should become Jews in the process of becoming Christians.
Paul opposed their call for circumcising Gentiles and thereby identifying them
with national Israel and obligating them to keep the Mosaic Law. He understood
in the first case, relative to the church, that Christianity does not have a
political component. He observed in the second case, relative to salvation,
that putting Gentiles under Jewish Law would in theory bring them under a
perfection requirement for continued relationship to God—initial salvation by
grace and continued salvation by works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Paul’s position on
these issues eventually won out, but in the modern church other matters still
make some interpreters unsure about his primary apostleship. <b>(2) </b>Classifying
him with the original group makes thirteen apostles rather than twelve. <b>(3)</b>
Paul did not accompany the followers of Jesus from the time of John’s baptism
until Christ’s ascension (Acts <b>1</b>:21-22). In fact, he was not even
converted until a few years after the church began, and then did not set out on
the first journey till another dozen years had passed. He was <i>“one born out
of due season,”</i> as Pasul puts it (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:8. <b>(4)</b>
When the Spirit did send him, it was with Barnabas in connection with the laying
on of hands by other leaders in the Antioch church (Acts <b>13</b>:1-4). <b>(5)</b>
Paul defends his apostleship primarily on dynamic factors instead of positional
ones. In 2 Corinthians <b>10-13</b>, for example, he stresses natural
leadership based on knowledge, ability, experience, and service more than
formal leadership by appointment and authority. Since <b>(6) </b>the Greek word
<i>apostle</i> in scripture has a wider application than to the original Twelve,
perhaps Christians ancient and modern were meant to regard him as simply a “sent
one” in the sense of “missionary.” Paul’s prominence was a function of his
personality, zeal, and abilities, not an indication of higher office. Possibly
he was like James the brother of Jesus, whom Paul classified with Peter and
John as pillars of the Jerusalem church.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In keeping with these
considerations, three attitudes prevail toward “the apostle to the Gentiles.” <b>(a)</b>
Paul <u>was</u> an apostle only in the general sense; the original Twelve of
Acts <b>1</b>:26 were apostles in the distinctive sense. <b>(b)</b> Paul was an
apostle in the technical sense. Within that possibility some have gone ahead to
regard Acts <b>1</b>:15-26 as another instance of Peter’s impetuousness; God
perhaps intended in time to replace Judas Iscariot with Saul of Tarsus. A final
view attempts to rise above the argument by concluding that <b>(c)</b> no
primary-secondary distinction existed among those called “apostles.” They spread
across a graduated scale of prominence based on personal factors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The best place to begin is
with that last idea. In the New Testament over twenty-five men bear the label “apostle.”
Besides the original Twelve plus Matthias and Paul, there are Barnabas,
Apollos, Silvanus, Timothy,<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> Andronicus
and Junias,<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> Epaphroditus,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4 </span>two unnamed men in 2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:16-23,
certain false prophets (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:13), Christ himself (Hebrews <b>3</b>:1),
and perhaps James, the brother of Jesus.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>5</span> Especially interesting are instances of combining under
one reference men traditionally thought of as apostles at different levels. Paul
and Barnabas are together termed apostles in Acts <b>14</b>:4, 14; Paul and
Apollos in 1 Corinthians <b>4</b>:6-9; and Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy in 1
Thessalonians <b>1</b>:1 + <b>2</b>:6. In this last context, Paul’s claim of
authority based on apostleship gets applied not only to himself, but to
Silvanus and Timothy as well. As a result, all the men beyond fourteen appear
in combination with Paul, traditionally considered a primary apostle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A positive presentation for
Paul as <u>primary</u> apostle rests on the observation that he had
characteristics traditionally used to identify primary apostles among the larger
group that bore the label. Among those termed <i>apostles</i>, fourteen
possessed a combination of special marks. The traditional distinctives of these
primary apostles fall under four headings that we can discuss in reference to
Paul. “Directness” is the common thread that runs through these qualifications.
(1) <b>Apostles were direct witnesses of the resurrected Christ</b>. In Acts <b>1</b>:22
Peter indicates that the replacement for Judas would serve as <i>“a witness
with us of the resurrection.” </i>Upon his selection, Matthias joined the
eleven apostles (<b>1</b>:26) in Peter’s statement on Pentecost, <i>“God raised
up this Jesus of whom/which we are all witnesses”</i> (<b>2</b>:32). Being
witnesses for Jesus in the context of resurrection language involves being
witnesses of the fact that he arose (cp. <b>3</b>:15; <b>4</b>:19-20). Acts <b>4</b>:33
speaks more pointedly, <i>“Very powerfully the apostles gave <u>their witness</u>
of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.”</i><span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>6</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>            </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In 1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:1-8 Paul lists his own
experience alongside other post- resurrection appearances of Jesus. He means to
classify his with the others as equally objective experiences. Acts shows that
the event was not merely subjective, because Paul’s traveling companions saw
the light and heard Christ’s voice (<b>22</b>:9), though they evidently did not
understand it (<b>9</b>:7).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7 </span>Paul
himself was physically blinded because the light was so bright (<b>22</b>:6,
11). It was the kind of seeing and hearing that enabled him to be a witness of
what he had seen and heard (<b>22</b>:14-15; <b>26</b>:16). Paul has this in
mind in 1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:1 when he connects his apostleship to seeing the
Lord. The fact that in his defense before Agrippa Paul calls his experience a
vision does not mean that it was subjective. The same word <i>optasia</i>
describes the angels’ appearance to the women at Jesus’ tomb (Luke <b>24</b>:23).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In choosing the replacement
for Judas, Peter called for someone who had accompanied the disciples from the
baptism of John till the ascension of Jesus (cp. Mark <b>3</b>:14). <i>“Till he
was received up from us”</i> would include the resurrection as well as indicate
that Jesus had not just left the area but gone to heaven. Peter did not explain
his reason for the first qualification. Perhaps <b>(a)</b> he meant to avoid
recent converts.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8 </span>If so, Paul
fits the spirit of the requirement in that he appears not to have begun concertedly
serving in any higher role than prophet and teacher until he and Barnabas left
on the first tour some twelve years after his conversion (Acts <b>13</b>:1-3). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             <b>(b)</b> Peter may have intended
to safeguard against any problem of mistaken identity by making sure a new
apostle could not be accused of seeing someone he <u>thought</u> was Jesus
resurrected. Such a view fits with the need for apostles to be credible
witnesses of the resurrection, the culminating concern to which Peter connects
the time span he specifies. In this case it becomes a moot question as to how
much Paul interacted with Jesus prior to his death and resurrection. Paul would
likely have known what Jesus looked like, because Paul lived in Jerusalem
during the feasts Jesus attended. Paul may have occupied a seat in the
Sanhedrin, because according to his defense before Agrippa he had “cast his
vote” against disciples of Jesus at their execution, which fits with his
prominent role in Stephen’s execution and the ensuing general persecution.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9 </span>If he held such office, he would
have known as well as anyone who this Galilean was, both from the trials that
led to his crucifixion and from the public scene on Golgotha afterward. Paul,
an avowed religious activist, may have been among those who periodically
investigated the work of Jesus and John the Baptist.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>10 </span>In the Damascus-road experience,<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>Paul did ask Jesus who he was, but that may have
been more to protect against self-deception or Satanic influence.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11 </span><i>“Have I not seen Christ?”</i>
(1 Corinthians<b> 9</b>:1) does not say <i>“seen the resurrected Christ.”</i> Seeing
the resurrected Christ would seem, however, to fit best his concerns in the
context to justify his apostleship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, <b>(c)</b> Peter
may have wanted someone with long-term exposure to Jesus so he could serve as a
primary witness of everything Jesus had done and taught. Such a man would have
received his message directly from Christ and could benefit from the promise to
bring to mind afterward what Jesus had said during his three and a half years
with his close followers (John <b>14</b>:26b).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (2)<b> Apostles were
directly chosen and commissioned by Christ</b>. The gospels and The Acts record
Christ’s original choosing<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> and
commissioning<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>of the
apostles.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>As One having final
authority in heaven and on earth, he directly sent the eleven to disciple those
who in turn would be indirectly sent to perpetuate the process till it had
reached every person.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>13 </span>After
the selection of Justus (Matthias) to replace Judas, Peter prayed that in the
casting of the lots God would show which one <u>he</u> had chosen (Acts<b> 1</b>:24).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul was also directly
chosen and commissioned (although the same could be said of Barnabas). In the
original conversion account, Jesus told Ananias that Saul of Tarsus was his <u>chosen</u>
vessel to carry his name before Gentiles, kings, and Israelites (Acts <b>9</b>:15).
The Lord told Paul directly that he had appeared to him to appoint him as a
minister and a witness of what he had seen (Acts <b>26</b>:16). Evidently as a
reinforcement against recurring tendencies to challenge his leadership, Paul
opens several epistles with a reference to his apostolic election.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>14</span> In his defense before the temple
mob in Jerusalem, the last thing Paul could get said was that God told him he
would <u>send</u> him far away to the Gentiles (Acts <b>22</b>:21; cp.
Galatians <b>1</b>:15-16). He wrote to the Galatians that God had entrusted him
with the Gentile mission as he had entrusted Peter with the Jewish mission (<b>2</b>:7).
Finally, to Timothy he expressed his gratitude to God for appointing him to his
service (1 Timothy <b>1</b>:11).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) <b>Apostles received
their message directly from Christ</b> rather than from other disciples. The
night of the betrayal, Jesus promised the eleven that he would send them the
Spirit to bring to mind what he had taught them (John <b>14</b>:26b) and to
reveal further truths they had not been ready for earlier (John<b> 16</b>:12-15;
14a). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul especially stressed the
primary origin of his message. Other men did not teach him gospel; Jesus Christ
revealed it to him.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>15</span> Ananias
reported to the persecutor that God had appointed him to know his will (Acts<b>
22</b>:14a). In The Acts <b>26</b>:16b Jesus told Paul directly that he had
appeared to him to make him a witness, not only of what he had seen
(resurrection), but of what Christ would show him (message?). Paul never
presented any teaching as something he learned from Christians or apostles
before him (Ephesians <b>3</b>:1-13). In fact, he went to considerable length,
especially in Galatians, to say that he deliberately interacted in private with
the Jerusalem apostles to avoid false impressions about learning from them (<b>2</b>:2).
The chief apostles imparted nothing to him (<b>2</b>:6-7). If anything, Paul
found himself at odds with the cultural and religious impulses of many earlier
Jewish Christian leaders including apostles (<b>2</b>:11-14). He pictured
himself as quite independent of them and quite directly dependent on Christ for
his message. As a result, he must have had experiences like what the apostles
had on Pentecost and Peter had on the housetop in Joppa. Such occasions would
have fulfilled Christ’s promise to make him a witness of the things in which he
would appear to Paul (Acts <b>26</b>:16). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (4) <b>Apostles were
directly empowered by the Spirit</b> rather than through prayer (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:13?)
or the laying on of hands (Acts <b>8</b>:14-19). Whereas in John the promise
about receiving the Spirit stresses the message, in Luke it stresses power: <i>“<u>I</u>
am sending my Father’s promise upon you, and <u>you</u> stay in the city till
you are dressed in power from on high”</i> (Luke <b>24</b>:49; cp. Acts<b> 1</b>:4-5,
8). Acts <b>2</b> records the Spirit’s visible descent on the apostles, which
Peter identifies with the Father’s promise (<b>2</b>:33). Subsequently the
narrative speaks of miracles and signs they performed (<b>2</b>:43; <b>5</b>:12-16;
<b>5</b>:32). Healing the lame man at Gate Beautiful was particularly
astounding (<b>3</b>:1-<b>4</b>:22), as was the exemplary condemnation of
Ananias and Sapphira (<b>5</b>:1-11). In fact, if not in the historical
sequence itself at least in Luke’s account of it, there is no clear case of
miraculous manifestation through anyone but apostles prior to the ministry of
Stephen, on whom the apostles had laid hands (<b>6</b>:8, 6). So, the record of
Christian origins and expansion not only connects the Spirit’s enablement
directly with apostles but connects it <u>primarily</u> with apostles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Apostolic empowerment to
perform miracles was distinctive in three ways: (1) apostles received their
empowerment directly, (2) could perform the broad range of miraculous
manifestation, and (3) could pass on gifts to other people. The basic Twelve
obviously received their empowerment directly. 1 Corinthians <b>12-14</b>
discusses spiritual gifts in a way that creates the impression that individuals
in congregations usually had one or two special endowments for edifying the
body and assisting in ministry. On the other hand, the Acts statements that
Stephen <i>“worked great signs and wonders among the people” (</i><b>6</b>:8)
and that Barnabas did signs and wonders (<b>14</b>:4) do sound as general as
the statements about the original apostles in <b>2</b>:43 and <b>5:</b>12-16. Lastly,
it works out that there is no clear case of “transmitting” gifts except by
apostles, although that does not prove other leaders did not transmit them.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>16</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Scripture does not say how
Paul received his miraculous empowerment. The record says nothing about miraculous
enablement until the rest of the Antioch prophets and teachers laid hands on
him and Barnabas to set them aside for the work to which the Spirit had called
them. The Acts record is about as vague that Paul the apostle did not receive
his enablement through non-apostles in <b>13</b>:3 as that Stephen the
evangelist did receive his from the apostles in <b>6</b>:6. About the closest
Paul comes to claiming direct empowerment is in the preferred text of 1 Timothy
<b>1</b>:11<i>: “I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who enabled me, that he counted
me faithful, appointing me to ministry.”</i> Since on this matter we cannot
arrive at our conclusion about Paul, it comes from a generalization from the
other primary apostles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The evidence is clear,
however, that Paul did exercise several gifts (Acts <b>14</b>:3; <b>15</b>:12)
and on several occasions referred to these signs and wonders as confirmation of
his message and ministry.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>17</span> He
spoke in languages (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:18), survived poisonous snake bite
(Acts <b>28</b>:1-6; cp. Mark <b>16</b>:18), was brought back from a near-death
experience (Acts </span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>14</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>:19-20); healed a variety of diseases (Acts <b>19</b>:12)
including a lame man (Acts <b>14</b>:8-10) and an elderly man sick with fever
and dysentery (Acts <b>28</b>:8-9); resurrected a young man named Eutychus
(Acts <b>20</b>:9-12), and exorcised evil spirits.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>18</span> Paul may refer to this wide range of gifts when he says
that <i>“the signs of an apostle”</i> were worked among the Corinthians (2
Corinthians <b>12</b>:12).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As to passing on miraculous
gifts, at Ephesus Paul laid hands on about a dozen men, giving them the gifts
of languages and prophecy (Acts <b>19</b>:1-7). He wrote ahead to the Romans
saying that for a long time he had wanted to come and impart some spiritual
gift to them.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>19</span> In his final
epistle, he reminded Timothy to stir up the gift he had through the laying on
of Paul’s hands.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>20 </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Arguing for the existence of
distinctive apostles among those labeled apostles rests on the four basic
characteristics <u>in combination</u>. <b>(a) </b>Not all of the more than five
hundred who directly saw the resurrected Christ were therefore apostles; the
two from Emmaus (Luke <b>24</b>:13-35) and Joseph Justus serve as ready
examples not termed apostles (Acts <b>1</b>:23-26). Some that were called
apostles had presumably not seen the risen Christ—Apollos and Timothy, for
example. <b>(b)</b> A number of prophets and teachers evidently received
directly from God at least aspects of their teaching and guidance. Many workers
in individual congregations possessed spiritual gifts; some of these gifts may
have come directly in answer to prayer since Paul himself told language
speakers in Corinth to pray that they might interpret (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:13).
The household of Cornelius received a direct outpouring of the Spirit
manifested miraculously by speaking in languages (Acts <b>10</b>:44-<b>11</b>:18).
By way of contrast, Apollos, though called an apostle, apparently got his
message—or had it adjusted—from Aquila and Priscilla (Acts <b>18</b>:24-28). <b>(c)</b>
Others besides Philip and Barnabas may, like them, have been directly
commissioned at least on specific missions like that of the seventy during
Christ’s ministry (Acts <b>8</b>:26-40; <b>13</b>:2-4; Luke<b> 10</b>:1-20). Men
like Barnabas and Philip even show a combination of two apostolic marks
(commissioning and empowerment), but they do not show all four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            From New Testament evidence we
can show in point-by-point fashion that Paul equaled the other primary apostles
with the ambiguous exception of how and when he received supernatural
enablement. Besides this inductive approach to each characteristic, Paul’s
primary apostleship becomes evident in his <u>claims</u> and <u>actions</u> in
relationship to other primary apostles. (5) <b>Paul claimed equality with
primary apostles</b>. Twice he told the Corinthians that he did not consider
himself in any way inferior to the special apostles, though he considered
himself nothing (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:5 + <b>12</b>:11). He claimed to be equal
to those of repute: they added nothing to him and even acknowledged his
ministry to Gentiles as parallel to Peter’s ministry to Jews (Galatians <b>2</b>:2-10).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Beyond claims and actions
relative to other <u>primary</u> apostles, (6) <b>Paul distinguished himself
above other secondary apostles</b>. He distinguished himself from certain other
men labeled apostles, which shows both that he differed from them and that the
term <i>apostle</i> covered more than one class of people. He sent and summoned
men in the “Pauline circle” like Timothy, Apollos, Silvanus, and the two
unnamed apostles in 2 Corinthians<b> 8</b>:16-23.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally comes a confirmatory
observation from canon criticism. (7) <b>Paul’s writings were considered
canonical by the ancient church</b>. Apostolicity provided the main criterion for
canonicity. Apostolicity did not mean simply that a writing originated in the
apostolic age. Apostolicity did not rest on the fact that someone might have
the term apostle applied to him in a generic sense; in that case any “missionary”
could have authored canonical literature. Apostolicity meant that the books
were written by apostles or those who served as extensions of the apostolic
office. Clearly Paul was not an apostle by extension of other apostles’ office.
If he had not been perceived as a primary apostle, no base would have existed
for considering his writings canonical. Furthermore, Luke-Acts would also have
had no basis for being regarded as apostolic since canonicity here depended on
Luke’s work as an extension of Paul’s apostolic office. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Besides positive arguments,
responses must deal with items that tend to obscure Paul’s primary apostleship.
Strictly speaking, <u>Paul’s apostleship makes thirteen apostles</u> rather
than twelve, but twelve may be viewed as a “stylized” number. There were twelve
apostles in the same sense that there were twelve tribes of Israel. Although
Israel had twelve <u>sons</u>, there were thirteen <u>tribes</u> because the
two sons of Joseph—Ephraim and Manasseh—replaced their father in the
enumeration; there was no tribe of Joseph. Furthermore, in allotted <u>territories</u>
there were Manasseh East in Transjordan (Numbers <b>27</b>:1) and Manasseh
West, which would have made fourteen except that the tribe of Levi had no
special territory but occupied cities among the other tribes. Twelve as a
standardized number for the apostles fits with John <b>20</b>:24 speaking of “the
Twelve” when the real number had reduced to eleven by the death of Judas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is also no need to
keep the apostolic number at exactly a dozen by supposing that Peter acted
presumptuously in leading a move to replace Judas. The text nowhere indicates
that his action was ill-advised. The opposite is implied by regarding the
choice as divine (Acts <b>1</b>:24) and is confirmed by the miraculous descent
of the Spirit on him soon afterward (Acts <b>1</b>:26 + <b>2</b>:14).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A greater difficulty has
been that <u>Paul did not company with Jesus from his baptism till his
ascension</u>. Previously we indicated that Peter may have meant the
qualification as a safeguard against novices, as a basis for confidently
identifying Jesus resurrected, as natural preparation for testifying to what
Jesus did and taught, or as a combination of these reasons. Here we observe
that Peter made the stipulation as a lead-in to being a witness to the
resurrection. The period of discipleship may be a practical prerequisite rather
than a theoretical necessity. Other qualifying experiences could have the same
effect of preparing someone for testifying to Jesus’ resurrection. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In addition, the
qualification was time-specific for picking Judas’ replacement and was conditioned
by that setting. The best men available at the time of Acts <b>1</b> would have
been followers of that type. Because as yet no time had elapsed since the
ascension, no one then under consideration had had <u>special</u> experiences
that could serve the same purpose as the <u>normal</u> basis Peter proposed for
testifying to the resurrection. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, even if Paul were a
secondary apostle, he was an inspired one. Under inspiration he claimed an
apostleship equal to Peter’s. If the time-span qualification were essential,
Paul could not have been consistent in claiming inspiration while falsely
claiming equality with Peter. The time-span qualification was a pragmatic
reason rather than an essential one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Paul and Barnabas were
both simultaneously commissioned by the Antioch church</u>. Even Paul sometimes
mixes himself with secondary apostles in his usage of the term, but he
elsewhere distinguishes himself from them in directing their ministries and
claiming equality to primary apostles. When <i>apostle</i> has the distinctive
sense, it includes apostle in the general sense; so, it can refer to groups
that include both “levels.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Paul defends his
apostleship by dynamic factors</u>. In dealing with the Corinthian church over
the legitimacy of his leadership and with Philemon over the manumission of
Onesimus, Paul did put in first position his love for the people (2 Corinthians
<b>2</b>:4; <b>12</b>:15), his knowledge of the gospel (<b>11</b>:6), his
ability, service, and experience with Christ (<b>12</b>:1-10). Paul appealed to
authority, however, when he warned some Corinthians,<i> “If I come, I will not
spare” </i>(2 Corinthians <b>10</b>:11; cp. <b>1</b>:23). He told Philemon that
he had the boldness to command him to do what was fitting in Christ, but
without his consent Paul did not want to keep Onesimus to help with ministry (Philemon
8ff). Paul defended his apostleship in reference to dynamic factors primarily,
but he did not defend it that way only. He did so because the Christian concept
of leadership puts dynamic matters in primary position and adds formal
authority to them. He wanted his people to understand that the authority he did
have was given <i>“for building them up, not for tearing them down”</i> (2
Corinthians <b>10</b>:8; <b>12</b>:10). Making that point clear was the best
protection Paul could give against <u>false</u> apostles (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:13).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A person might still say
that Paul had authority, but the authority he had was based on founding the
churches he directed and protected as well as on the service, knowledge,
ability, and experiences by which he had earned that authority. Such an
approach returns again to dynamic leadership <i>vs.</i> formal leadership. Many
would even question whether anything but dynamic leadership existed anywhere in
the church, much less in the case of Paul’s apostleship. Without wanting to
detract from an emphasis on natural leadership, we stress the fact that natural
does not <u>eliminate</u> formal but <u>precedes</u> it. In Paul’s case, (a) he
did not have influence only, but authority as well. (b) His authority was not
just earned; it was given. (c) His authority was not just given by those from
whom he earned it by service; it was given by the Lord who sent him<i>: “For
this reason I am writing these things while absent so that I may not, when
present, deal sharply according to the authority that <u>the Lord gave me</u> .
. .”</i> (2 Corinthians <b>13</b>:10). We may even say that Paul de-emphasized
authority; but he did not do so because he did not have it, but because
Christian leadership appeals to authority only after it appeals to persuasion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Being a prominent apostle
stemmed from Paul’s personality and service as an apostle, not from being an
apostle in a distinctive sense</u>. The idea is that no distinction existed
among those designated “apostles” as shown by the large number of them and by
references where both types combine under the one designation. There were no
such things as church “offices.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In response we should
observe that there was a process of selection to replace Judas. A selection
process presupposes formal leadership; a distinct group among people with
shared characteristics means official positions with assigned responsibilities
and authority given to fulfill them. A specific apostle was selected from among
those who qualified; those selected further shared the distinctives explained
above. Paul shared these characteristics and claimed to be parallel to others
who had them. His prominence was based both on his personality and service and
on his distinctive qualifications, which show that Paul was a primary apostle.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>21</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We can raise a concluding counter-question.
There were those who called themselves apostles and were not (2 Corinthians<b>
11</b>:13; Revelation <b>2</b>:2). There must have been a technical usage of
the term “apostle”; otherwise, there could not have been false ones. If
apostleship consisted purely of dynamic considerations, would it be possible to
have a false apostle making claims to serve when they were not legitimate? </span></p>
