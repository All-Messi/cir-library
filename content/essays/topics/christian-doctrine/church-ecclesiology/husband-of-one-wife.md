style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul gives <i>“husband of one wife” </i>as
a characteristic of elders and deacons in 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:2, 12 and Titus <b>1</b>:6.
The following diagram traces the pattern of thought for determining what he meant
by this phrase.</span></p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            STEP I. We must distinguish between what to
do because it is best under the circumstances (“expediency”) and what a passage
requires (“exegesis”). For instance, in the case of married <i>versus</i> not
married, it is one thing to say that there are advantages to having a married
eldership; it is another thing to say that Paul is requiring a married
eldership. This treatment of the problem addresses primarily what the passage
means as to whether elders and deacons must be married.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            STEP II. In any example of language, a
second distinction exists between what an expression can mean in <u>differing</u>
contexts and what it is intended to mean in <u>this</u> context. <u>Husband of
one wife</u> might require marriage in the right context, but giving it that
meaning here is a different matter. It could likewise eliminate from the
eldership and deaconship someone who had remarried after the death of his wife
(deuterogamy), but whether Paul means to eliminate such men here is another
question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The meaning of <u>husband of one wife</u>
probably cannot be settled from 1 Timothy <b>3</b>. Titus <b>1</b>:5-7 provides
the key to Paul’s intent:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“If any man is <u>blameless</u>, a husband of one
wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly—<u>because</u>
the bishop must be <u>blameless</u> as God’s steward.”</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Blameless” appears on both sides of the target expression,
and the word <i>because</i> links the characteristic to that blamelessness. The
kind of reason Paul gives for the characteristic shows what kind of characteristic
he has in mind. A moral/ethical reason anticipates a moral/ethical conclusion. Paul
requires an elders and deacons to be husbands of one wife because they should
be blameless. Furthermore, blameless must have a biblical, rather than
cultural, frame of reference; otherwise, this characteristic would not be
constant from place to place or time to time. We must consult the rest of the
New Testament to determine what blameless marital statuses there are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            STEP III. From 1 Corinthians<b> 7</b>:25-28,
it is obvious that whether a man is married is an “amoral” matter. Being married
is a legal status, not a moral one. So, <i>“husband of one wife”</i> does not
necessitate marriage here regardless of what the expression could mean under different
circumstances. Romans <b>7</b>:1-3 and 1 Corinthians <b>7:</b>39 indicate that
a similar line of reasoning applies to remarriage after the death of a former
mate: it is blameless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The figure below represents the author’s
understanding of Paul’s intent based on the observation from Titus <b>1</b>:5-7
that he has a moral matter in mind. The larger circle represents the possible
applications of <u>husband of one wife</u>; the more restricted circle
represents moral matters biblically defined. Whether a man is married or a
deuterogamist falls outside the moral category. The decision about a scripturally
remarried divorcé depends on a person’s understanding of that issue as a
separate concern under specific circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Husband of one wife,</u> ethically
speaking, would most naturally eliminate polygamists and some divorcees. Since
the lists of characteristics do not mention fornication and adultery separately,
they are probably included here by implication. Since “flirting” is a
behavioral expression of the same weakness, it should belong under this
qualification too.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1.  <u>Wife of one husband</u> is a
comparable expression in 1 Timothy <b>5</b>:9 used of widows enrolled in
support by the church. <b>(a)</b> It is hard to see that the expression could
possibly be requiring marriage. If a woman had never married, it would likely
make her a <u>more</u> legitimate object of benevolence since she would have no
family to support her in her old age (cp. 1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:4). <b>(b)</b> We
also find it hard to see why a woman widowed the second time would be
eliminated from the church’s benevolence program, because she remarried after
the death of her first husband (note especially 1 Timothy<b> 5</b>:14).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2.  <u>Husband of one wife</u> does not
have an article on <i>“man/husband” </i>in the Greek, which puts emphasis on
character: he must be <i>“husband of one wife,”</i> a<i> “one-woman-kind-of
man,” “a one-woman man,”</i> as commentators sometimes say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3.  Since church leaders always come from
the local membership, we would not expect to have a required characteristic
that Paul <u>advises</u> the <u>general membership</u> is <u>against</u>
because it might <u>hinder their service</u> under “distress” conditions (1
Corinthians <b>7</b>:28-38).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            4.  It seems unlikely that a man like Paul
would be unqualified for a <u>position lower</u> than the one he held because
of a qualification <u>not germane</u> to Christian concerns. Paul may have been
an elder in Antioch (Acts <b>13</b>:1-3) since <u>teacher</u> can be an
alternate term for elder (Ephesians <b>4</b>:11), and the New Testament never
mentions <u>elders</u> in Antioch. Paul may have been married at one time and his
wife had subsequently died or deserted him after his conversion (Philippians<b>
3</b>:8?). He may have been a member of the Sanhedrin, which presumably required
marriage.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            5.  If Paul wanted to require marriage, he
could have said it more clearly: <i>“It is necessary for an elder to be
married.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            6.   To be consistent, those who think
that <i>“husband of one wife”</i> requires being married should require that an
elder or deacon have more than one child (which would eliminate any sterile man
or anyone with a barren wife), that the children be old enough to believe in
Christ, and perhaps that they be living at home.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1.  A man cannot be the husband of <u>one</u>
wife without having a wife. It is true as regards <u>reality</u> that a man
cannot have one wife without having at least one, but with the <u>mind</u> a
speaker may distinguish between one <i>vs</i>. more than one without intending
also to require one <i>vs</i>. none. In the case at hand, the intended contrast
is between one and more than one (further restricted to not more than one in a
morally blameful sense). It is true that one cannot drive 45 mph unless he is
driving, but a government that requires us to drive 45 mph does not require us
to drive. A characteristic that regulates man-woman relationships does not
require a man-woman relationship. The intended contrast to the <u>words</u> is the
concern; a reader must not confuse language and reality (reification).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2.  1 Timothy <b>3</b>:5 asks how a man
can take care of the church if he cannot manage his own home. The verse does
not signify that a man must have the <u>experience</u> of managing the home before
managing the church. It offers a negative test. If he does <u>not</u> know how
to manage his house, we surmise that he cannot accomplish the harder task of managing
the church. Certain results are required in the domestic testing area; that
does not require the testing area itself. Having the experience of exercising
authority is evidently not the point of the husband-of-one-wife requirement,
because Paul repeats it with deacons, who do not hold an authoritative position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Related to experience in exercising
authority is the question of how people are to know whether someone can manage
well unless he has <u>demonstrated</u> such ability in the home. (a) Ability to
lead can be developed and demonstrated in other places like business and
education or in “unofficial” natural leadership in the church. (b) The deacon’s
position is a natural place to develop and demonstrate the ability to carry
responsibility and perhaps exercise delegated authority (1 Timothy<b> 3</b>:13).
(c) We can usually tell responsible leaders by the way they move among people.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Stability</u> of personality might be
enhanced by marriage, but not being married does not necessarily involve
instability. Sometimes the reason a man is not married may be the reason he is
not qualified to be an elder, but his not being married does not in itself
disqualify him.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3.  An elder can better meet the needs of
married people if he has been married. While that is true, it does not
necessitate a married elder any more than it necessitates a married minister. People
do not argue that to be biblically qualified, a minister has to be married. That
consideration has practical value, but expediency is different from necessity
and from what a text means. There would normally be other, married elders who
could assist in areas where the lack of domestic experience might make it hard
for married people to come to a celibate elder for counsel. In the Roman
Catholic church, the unmarried priests take part in marital counseling work.</span></p>

had to be married. The weight of this consideration has questionable relevance
since the church is a different kind of institution.</span></p>

shows Especially of note is his framing this item with the word “blameless”
before and after “husband of one wife.” Of note as well is the apostle’s
listing <i>“husband of one wife”</i> with deacons (1 Timothy <b>3</b>:8-13),
where the teaching-ruling function does not come up (<b>3</b>:12?). Above
reproach, blameless, behavior saturates the descriptions of elders and deacons.</span></p>
