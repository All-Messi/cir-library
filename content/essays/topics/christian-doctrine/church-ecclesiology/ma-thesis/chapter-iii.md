.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>This chapter sketches the original
organization of the universal church according to the evidence of the New
Testament taken alone. As respects authority the approach will be to determine
what positions have authority and to consider the rest as functions. This
procedure is possible not only because an either-or matter is under
consideration, but more particularly because authority includes function. One
cannot suppose that a <u>function</u> is seen as such only because the evidence
recorded happens to be insufficient to show that it was really an <u>office</u>.
That approach becomes an argument from silence and shifts the burden of proof
onto the negative. The negative burden of proof in this instance would be
impossible since the only available evidence would pertain to function, which
is part of the larger concept of office.</span></p>

authority. Jesus Christ is both Savior and Lord (Ephesians<b> 5</b>:23; Titus <b>1</b>:4;
2 Peter <b>2</b>:20; <b>3</b>:2, 18) in that order (Ephesians<b> 1</b>:20 +

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The second position of service in the
church is that of apostle. In the New Testament more than twenty-five persons
bear the label “apostle” in the general sense of missionary, or “one sent.”<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> Of these, fourteen may be singled
out as apostles in an added special sense, (a) having in common certain
distinguishing marks and (b) being perceived as peculiar from the rest.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> The distinguishing mark of the
original twelve, Matthias, and Paul was (1) their being personally chosen by
Christ as (2) special eyewitnesses of his resurrection.<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> The combination of these two elements is
important. Over five hundred could bear witness to the fact itself; but were
not all officially chosen, appointed, endowed, commissioned, and guided. Many
preached the resurrection who had not seen it. If there had been no difference
between the apostleship of “the Twelve” and that of others called “apostles,” there
would have been no more reason formally to replace Judas than any one of the
others.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> None of the others
are not known to have been replaced in this way. Paul’s manner of sending and
calling the others who are called apostles, also seems to indicate a difference
between himself and them (Colossians<b> 4</b>:7-11; 2 Timothy <b>4</b>:9-13,
20-21; Titus <b>3</b>:12-13). Finally, no one except the Twelve-plus-Paul ever
refers to <u>himself</u> as an apostle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>That the Twelve were perceived as a
special group comes in the very references to them as “the Twelve” (Matthew <b>10</b>:1-2;
John <b>6</b>:67, 70, 71; <b>20</b>:24), then “the Eleven” after Judas Iscariot
committed suicide (Matthew <b>28</b>:16; Mark <b>16</b>:14; Luke <b>24</b>:9,
33; Acts <b>1</b>:26), and then “the Twelve” again after the selection of
Matthias (Acts <b>6</b>:2). John <b>20</b>:24 is significant in that “the
Twelve” occurs in a passage where the number had been reduced by the death of
Judas. Paul conceived of himself as equal with the most important apostles
(Galatians <b>1-2</b>) and was accepted by them in this capacity (Galatians <b>2</b>:8-9).
In that Paul was also accounted an apostle in the technical sense, there were “twelve”
apostles in the same sense as there were “twelve” tribes of Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Authoritative</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. In respect to the <u>reason for</u>, and the <u>nature
of</u>, supervisory authority, it is axiomatic that the highest present rank in
an authoritative system is itself necessarily authoritative at least as long as
the ultimate authority is absent. This axiom is true for the reason that if
supervisory authority is needed at all, it is needed for the orderly and
efficient functioning of the system as/where it is functioning. The church
partakes of supervisory authority by virtue of its Head who has such authority.
His appointment of the apostles gave them the ultimate earthly leadership
during his absence.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span> In such
a position, what they did they were “authorized” to do and what they were
authorized to do involved supervising the activities of others. In addition to
making converts, they disciplined and set them in order. Christ’s authority not
only passed down <u>to</u> them as functionaries, but down <u>through</u> them
as officers. Since his authority was always passing through them, and since he
himself was absent during their whole ministry, one may say that authority
inhered <u>in</u> the apostleship itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As one views the <u>functioning</u> of
supervisory authority, the right to lead on the basis of <u>service performed</u>
(1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:7) is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the right
to lead based on <u>authority given</u> (Matthew <b>28</b>:18-19). Particularly
is this the case with church leadership, where authoritative right always
includes service right. Moreover, certain passages describe church authority as
exclusive of “lordship,” as when Jesus says that his apostles are not to
exercise lordship like the kings of the Gentiles.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>7</span> Such statements, however, involve a pejorative use of the
word “lordship”; because Jesus who had the <u>authority of Lord</u> (John <b>13</b>:13)
conducted himself in the <u>attitude of Servant</u> (Luke <b>22</b>:25). They
strike at the <u>motives</u> of the <u>person</u> rather than the <u>fact</u>
of his <u>authority</u>, the <u>manner</u> of using rather than the <u>right</u>
to use. If rightful authority includes able service, no one minds being subject
to it. The question, then, is not so much <u>what</u> is done, but the <u>basis</u>
on which it is done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Certain statements in Paul’s writings seem
to presuppose a right to lead on the basis of authority given. In connection
with <u>disciplining</u> the Corinthians, he uses language that would seem
presumptuous outside the context of a recognized formal authority. Among these
instances is 1 Corinthians <b>4</b>:21, where he asks whether they would have
him come <i>“with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness.”</i> Note the
otherwise idle and boastful threat in 2 Corinthians <b>13</b>:2, <i>“If I come
again, I will not spare”</i> (cp. 2 Corinthians <b>1</b>:23; <b>10</b>:8-11; <b>13</b>:10).
The right to discipline has legal implications, but Paul wanted to handle
problems in personal love. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>One <u>commanding situation</u> in Paul
also brings up the distinction between his right in Christ and his preference
for beseeching in love. He says regarding his desire to keep another man’s
slave, <i>“Though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin what is appropriate,
yet for the sake of love I beseech instead . . . that your goodness be not of
necessity, but of free will”</i> (Philemon 8-14). Paul had confidence in
Philemon’s “obedience” (21). He uses the strong verb </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>διατάσσω</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>in 1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:1 in reference
to his “giving order” to the churches of Galatia about the offering. The case
for formal right should not be pushed too far in connection with commanding
statements, for the commanding idea itself says nothing particularly about
official right over someone else as is obvious in Gamaliel’s “command” to
fellow members of the Sanhedrin (Acts<b> 5</b>:34-40). The same may be said of “setting
in order” (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:34; cf. Titus <b>1</b>:5). Even Paul’s
foregone right to command support (1 Thessalonians<b> 2</b>:6-9; 2
Thessalonians <b>3</b>:8-9) does not rest on more than the right of service (1
Corinthians <b>9</b>:7-19); yet in the case of Onesimus the slave of Philemon,
right by grant may be intended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The apostles’ <u>appointment</u> of the
seven in Acts <b>6</b>:1-7 indicates supervisory authority especially since
they took the initiative in this new matter (cp. Acts <b>14</b>:23; contrast
Titus <b>1</b>:5). These kinds of observations on the functioning of the
apostleship <u>confirm</u> the fact that the Lord himself appointed them as
authoritative leaders with responsibility for establishing the church during
his absence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>General</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. In commissioning the apostles, Jesus sent them to
the whole world, to every nation, to every classification of mankind (Matthew <b>28</b>:19;
Mark <b>16</b>:15, 20; Luke <b>24</b>:47; Acts <b>1</b>:8). Recounting their
triumphant establishment of the universal church in a hostile world, the book
of Acts traces the spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome, emphasizing the
Apostle to the Circumcision and the Apostle to the Gentiles (cp. Galatians<b> 2</b>:8).
According to Galatians <b>2</b>:7-10 Peter and Paul concentrated respectively
on the Circumcision and the Uncircumcision, an exhaustive listing from the
Jewish viewpoint (cp. Ephesians <b>2</b>:11ff., <i>etc</i>.). Paul speaks of
his anxiety for all the church<u>es</u> (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:28; cp. 1
Corinthians <b>4</b>:17; <b>7</b>:17; <b>16</b>:1). The apostles’ letters in
the New Testament canon are directed to individuals, churches, and territories
in broad range throughout the northern Mediterranean: Syria, Asia Minor,
Greece, and Italy. The scope of the apostolic ministry was as wide as the scope
of the Christian gospel. Apostleship is therefore a general office.</span></p>

.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Usage of the word <i>elder</i></span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. A third position in the church of Christ is elder,
or presbyter. Of the seventy-five times </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<i>presbyteros</i>) and its cognates occur in the New
Testament, sixteen are clear references to an office in the church. Other
usages refer to apostles (3), Jewish elders (33), men of old (1), old men (10),
and the twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse (12).<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>8</span> The word, therefore, has general and technical
denotations. In technical references to the office of elder, the word seems to
retain its meaning of “older,” as in 1 Peter <b>5</b>:1-5, where Peter exhorts
the <u>younger</u> to be subject to the <u>elder</u>, who had responsibility
for, and over, the flock; hence, the eldership is an office of personal
Christian maturity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Equation of elder and bishop</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. “Bishop” </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐπίσκοπος</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> (<i>episkopos</i>) is another term used in the New
Testament to refer to the office of elder. The <u>primary evidence</u> for
equating them is interchangeable use of <i>elder</i> and <i>bishop</i> in
common reference. Two contexts provide the primary evidence for equating them. In
Acts <b>20</b> the Ephesian <u>elders</u> (<b>20</b>:17) are to watch out for
the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made them <u>bishops</u> (<b>20</b>:28).
Luke calls them “elders”; Paul calls them “bishops.” In Titus 1 Paul explains
that he left Titus in Crete to appoint <u>elders</u> (<b>1</b>:5), men
blameless in their domestic relations because <u>bishops</u> (<b>1</b>:7) must
be blameless as God’s stewards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The two terms are not used in a way that
allows one to be within the other, as if bishop were a more narrow category
than elder. In Acts <b>20</b>:17 and 28 the historian and the apostle refer to
the same <u>group of people</u>; in Titus <b>1</b>:5-9 Paul lists
qualifications for <u>one office</u>. <i>Bishop</i> and <i>elder</i> are not
simply used in the same context; they are used interchangeably in the same
context with reference to the same predicate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In conformity with Paul’s interchange of <i>bishop</i>
and <i>elder</i> in Acts <b>20</b> and Titus 1, he gives a <u>common
description</u> of elder and bishop. He says in 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:4-5<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9 </span>concerning a bishop that he must
be “a person who <u>rules</u> [</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>proistēmi</i>] <i>his household well, having
children in <u>subjection</u></i> [</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὑποταγή</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>hypotagē</i>] with all respectfulness; but if a
man does not know how to <u>rule</u> [</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>] <i>his own house, how
will he <u>take care of</u></i> [</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐπιμελέομαι</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>epimeleomai</i>]<i> the church of God?” </i>(a)
The qualifications laid down in Titus <b>1</b> under the double label “elder-bishop”
parallel the ones here under the single label “bishop.” (b)1 Timothy <b>3</b>
speaks of the ruling-caring for, idea in connection with the work of “bishops”
and later associates it with that of “elders” in <b>5</b>:17, <i>“Let the
elders who <u>rule</u> [</i></span><i><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span></i><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>] well be counted worthy of double honor, especially
those who work in word and teaching.”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
Working “in word and teaching” (<b>5</b>:17) also parallels <b>3</b>:2, which
stipulates that a candidate be “able to teach.” While requiring high personal
and domestic characteristics for deacons in <b>3</b>:8-13, Paul does not
require of them the ability to teach or the responsibility of “ruling” the
church as he does of bishops (<b>3</b>:2, 4-5), and these are the very two
elements joined together in <b>5</b>:17. (c) Finally, Paul combines bishops and
deacons in Philippians<b> 1</b>:1 as in 1 Timothy<b> 3</b>, where “bishop” in
turn equals the “bishop-elder” of Titus <b>1</b>. He seems to have had the same
position in mind, then, in Titus <b>1</b>:5-9 (bishop-elder), 1 Timothy <b>3</b>
(bishop), 1 Timothy <b>5</b>:17ff. (elder), and Philippians <b>1</b>:1
(bishop).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

eldership and bishopric, there is no New Testament unit of immediate context
that ever mentions bishops and elders together, so as to imply distinctness.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Primary evidence for equation lies in (1)
the interchangeableness of terms in common reference, confirmed by (2) common
description and (3) absence of distinguishing reference in combination. One
must conclude from this evidence that </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:

will strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered”</i> (cp. Matthew <b>26</b>:3

in John (also in Matthew <b>9</b>:36 = Mark<b> 6</b>:34; Matthew <b>25</b>:32).
Pastors are mentioned in Ephesians <b>4</b>:11 among the ministries Christ gave
after his ascension. “Pastor,” or “shepherd” (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ποιμήν</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <i>poimēn</i>),
is used only twice more outside the gospels, both times in reference to Christ
(Hebrews <b>13</b>:20; 1 Peter<b> 2</b>:25). The question is raised then as to
what a pastor is in Paul’s list of ministries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Two contexts shed light on the ministry
indicated in Ephesians <b>4</b>:11: Acts <b>20</b>:17-35 and 1 Peter <b>5</b>:1ff.
In both places the shepherding metaphor is combined with the elder-bishop
terminology discussed above. The elders of Ephesus (Acts <b>20</b>:17) were to
fulfill the ministry of bishops (<b>20</b>:28) in the “flock” that they were to
“feed” (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ποιμαίνω</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>) and protect from wolves (<b>20</b>:28-29). This same
set of figures (elder, bishop, pastor) appears in the 1 Peter passage, where
elders (<b>5</b>:1) are exhorted to pastor the flock (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ποιμαίνω</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <b>5</b>:2)
as bishops (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἐπίσκοποι</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, <b>5</b>:2) anticipating the return of the Chief
Shepherd (</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀρχιποιμήν</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>,<b> 5</b>:4). “Pastor” evidently means the same thing
as “elder” and “bishop” because the pastoring idea is incorporated at least
twice in a series of interwoven metaphors dealing with the work of
elder-bishops.</span></p>

ruling and providing for the flock. <u>Ruling</u> is especially prominent in

flock of sheep corresponds to teaching a group of people. Thus as respects
description, in the work of a pastor there are the same two responsibilities of
elder-bishops: ruling and teaching.                        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

the basis for equating pastors in Ephesians <b>4</b>:11 with elder-bishops: (1)

important to the matter of identification as the omission of a second article,
for by the general grammatical construction one gains insight into the way Paul
presently conceptualizes the set of parallel categories. In Ephesians <b>4</b>:11
he balances off apostles against prophets, then against evangelists, and then
against pastors and teachers. These are grammatically parallel examples of
positions that are Christ’s parallel gifts to his church for maturation. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>. In summary, four terms are used in the New Testament
to refer to one position: “elder,” “bishop,” “pastor,” and sometimes “teacher.”
<u>The equation of elder and bishop</u> rests primarily on (a) full interchange
of terminology with the same reference within Acts <b>20</b>:17-35 and Titus<b>
1</b>:5-6, confirmed by (b) common description (didactic, authoritative, and
local) and (c) lack of distinguishing reference in combination. <u>Elder-bishop
is then equated with pastor</u> in that (a) pastoring is an expressive figure
for the prominent responsibilities of elder-bishop (ruling and teaching); (b)
the pastoring metaphor is used to describe the elder-bishop’s work; and (c)
Paul omits elder-bishop in the one place where pastor is used of a church
office. <u>Elder-bishop-pastor evidently equals teacher</u> in Ephesians <b>4</b>:11
and 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28, 29 since in the first passage “teacher” forms
with “pastor” a hyphenated expression that parallels “teacher” standing alone
in the second.</span></p>

distribution of examples, elders are known to have existed in every area whose
evangelization is recorded in the New Testament: Jerusalem, cities of southern
Asia Minor, cities of northern Asia Minor, Ephesus, Philippi, cities of Crete,
as well as perhaps Rome, Antioch, and Thessalonica.<span style='position:relative;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<u>comparisons</u> used with eldership. In 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:5 Paul draws a
parallel between the home and the church when he says, <i>“If a man does not
know how to rule his own home, how will he take care of the church of God?”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>22</span> Actually a man’s responsibility
as head of the home is more than a <u>comparison</u> with his work as leader of
the church. The one is an <u>example</u> of the other because there are real
elements common to both. (1) Authority is involved in being head of the <u>home</u>,
an authority like Christ’s as head of the <u>church</u> (Ephesians <b>5</b>:22-23).
More importantly, (2) connecting father and elder establishes a model by which
to think of the eldership and gives a feel for the way an elder is to carry his
authority in the church: as a loving father does in the home and as Christ does
in the church. Finally, (3) it puts the headship in the context of service. As
Christ is both Savior and Lord, so the husband is helper and head, and the
elder is servant and ruler.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>23         </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A third strand of evidence for the
eldership as an authoritative office comes in certain examples of <u>operation</u>.
The relief offering from Antioch was sent to the elders (Acts <b>11</b>:30)
even though men had been chosen to distribute relief goods (Acts <b>6</b>:1-6);
this is similar to the previous practice in Jerusalem of laying offerings at
the apostles’ feet (Acts <b>4</b>:35, 37; <b>5</b>:2) though they did not
distribute them (Acts<b> 6</b>:2). This procedure pictures the apostles and
later the elders as men who were responsible for such matters, but who did not
themselves perform the work: supervisory authority. The conference on
circumcision in Acts <b>15</b> shows the elders gathering with the apostles to
consider the problem raised by certain men who had gone out from Jerusalem
preaching to Gentiles the necessity of circumcision and allegiance to the law
of Moses. They deliberated the problem with the apostles and joined in an
official statement on behalf of the Jerusalem church that these Judaizing
teachers had not been sent out by them. Paul’s summons to the Ephesian elders
in Acts <b>20</b> seems also to imply that these men were the responsible
leaders of the church there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In summary, evidence for authority in the
eldership comes from appropriate word associations confirmed by example. These
interrelated strands of data are particularly close in 1 Timothy. Speaking of
elders’ qualifications in <b>3</b>:5, the apostle parallels the home and the
church. This parallel involves especially </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>προΐστημι</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, a
potential authority word applied to the husband in <b>3</b>:4, 5 and to the
elder in<b> 5</b>:17. Having made the parallel between the home and the church
as regards leadership, Paul applies the same potential authority term to both
husband and elder in close context. Under such circumstances one expects
continuity of meaning. Authority is an ingredient in being head of the home;
hence, it is in the church. The ability to use authority in combination with
other, dynamic factors is common to both institutions, and success at using it
in the one is presumptive evidence for ability to use it in the other. (1)
Potential authority <u>words</u> are applied to elders and to (2) certain
illustrative <u>comparisons</u> like shepherding and being a husband. (3)
Elders in their <u>operation</u> demonstrate authoritative leadership.<span

New Testament, nothing seems to indicate that they exercised supervisory
authority over their hearers. This picture accords well with that of the Old
Testament prophet who stood as a purely charismatic leader <u>among the people</u>
rather than <u>in the government</u>. Authority resided not in his <u>position</u>
in the nation’s political structure, but in his <u>message</u> from God. Likewise
church prophets ministered, not from a position of <u>authority</u>, but from a

appropriate principle to invoke by which it may be presumed, prophet falls in
the category of function and therefore is not in the church’s pattern of

the famine (Acts <b>11</b>:27-28) and the bondage of Paul (Acts<b> 21</b>:10-11).
More often it was <u>communication</u>. Paul’s admonitions to prophets in 1
Corinthians<b> 14</b> focus on the importance of prophesying as distinguished
from speaking in tongues without communicating a message. This prophesying,
however, has a different emphasis from teaching generally, so that prophets and
teachers may be listed side by side.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>35</span> The
difference between them seems to lie in the particular reference to divine
endowment, or revelation: “But if something is revealed to one who is seated, let
the first be silent” (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:30). Whether special prediction
or general communication, prophesying looks at the origin of the divine message
being dispensed, rather than at the dispensing of the divine message itself.</span></p>

prophets <u>as prophets</u> were potential for general function. The nature of
their ministry was general in application, for neither predicting nor revealing
is local perforce. Accordingly, prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch
(Acts <b>11</b>:27; <b>15</b>:22, 27, 32) and to Caesarea (Acts <b>21</b>:10) <u>as
prophets</u>. Judas and Silas were either elders or general members at
Jerusalem (Acts <b>15</b>:22), but they went to Antioch and functioned there <u>as
prophets</u>. Indeed, there were prophets “<u>in</u> the church” at Antioch
(Acts <b>13</b>:1). Furthermore, Agabus lived in Judaea from the time of Acts <b>11</b>:27
to <b>21</b>:10–over fifteen years; but these men could, and did, move outside
their normal area of service from time to time. Prophet, therefore, was <u>potential</u>

Jerusalem taught would be highly influential since the other apostles labored
there. Disagreement among the apostles or between these two churches would be

Jerusalem in the eyes of Antioch, (b) dispelled the fear that the two churches
were divided on basic doctrine, and (c) provided a public occasion for the
Jerusalem church generally to hear the discussion so others of them might be

characterized by the missionary calling carried out only in non-authoritative
charisma, see J. C. Lambert, “Apostle,” <i>ISBE</i>, Vol. I, pp. 202-4. His
principal error seems to be in forgetting that “apostle” in the special sense
includes all the general meaning as well. There are two related reasons that
more than fourteen men are called “apostles.” (1) The first is the missionary
concept associated with the term. The activity to which it refers is the same
as that of evangelist. The two words arise from different aspects of the whole
activity: the “being sent” and the “good news” men were sent to declare. (2)
Several of these men as members of the Pauline circle were extensions of the
apostolic office and so bore the name of the office they were representing (see
pp. 54-55).</span></p>

<b>13</b>:18 (<b>15</b>:16-17); Acts <b>1</b>:2 + 13; <b>10</b>:41; of Matthias

of Paul in Acts <b>9</b>:15; <b>13</b>:2;<b> 20</b>:24; <b>26</b>:16; Galatians<b>
1</b>:1, 16; 1 Timothy <b>1</b>:1 (cp. Titus<b> 1</b>:3). (2) Seeing the
resurrected Christ is mentioned as a qualification in Acts <b>1</b>:22 (<i>“witness
with us of the resurrection”</i>; cp. Luke <b>24</b>:44-48; Acts <b>1</b>:1-8; <b>2</b>:32;<b>
3</b>:15; <b>4</b>:19-20, 33 “<u>their</u> witness”; <b>5</b>:32; <b>9</b>:17; <b>10</b>:39,

+ 1 John <b>1</b>:1; 1 Peter <b>5</b>:1 + 2 Peter <b>1</b>:16-21). Paul
associates his apostleship with seeing the Lord in 1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:1
(probably meaning the resurrected Lord, though he may have seen Christ before).
The Damascus experience was an objective event as indicated by the fact that
Paul’s companions heard Christ’s voice (Acts <b>22</b>:9; </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀκούω</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>+ acc.), without understanding it (Acts <b>9</b>:7; </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἀκούω</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:
12.0pt'> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>+ gen.), and saw the light (Acts
<b>22</b>:9. Paul himself was also physically blinded by the glory of the light
(<b>22</b>:6, 11). It was the kind of seeing and hearing that enabled Paul to
be a <u>witness</u> of what he had seen and heard (Acts<b> 22</b>:14-15), I
being a peculiar word for the apostolic mission. Furthermore, in a table of
post-resurrection appearances Paul lists himself last in parallel to the
incidents recorded in the Gospels (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:1-8). That Paul’s
apostleship was in the same sense as that of the Twelve is evident in Galatians<b>
2</b>:7-8. Other distinguishing marks of the apostles were (3) receiving their
message directly from Christ through the Holy Spirit rather than through other
men (John <b>16</b>:13-15; Acts <b>1</b>:8; Galatians <b>1</b>:11-12; Ephesians
<b>3</b>:1-13; 1 Timothy <b>1</b>:11); (4) being endowed directly with
miraculous power (Acts <b>2</b>) rather than through the laying on of hands
(Acts <b>8</b>:14-19) or perhaps prayer (1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:14?); (5)
being each one supernaturally endowed with the whole range of miraculous
manifestation rather than with different particular gifts (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28-31).
The apostles were direct witnesses, directly chosen, informed, and endowed. (6)
A secondary element mentioned in Acts<b> 1</b>:22-23––companying with Christ
during His ministry (cp. Mark <b>3</b>:4)––probably has the general force of
not being a novice (cp. 1 Timothy <b>3</b>:6). Paul fits even this stipulation
at least in spirit. He was not a novice when he began his apostolic work,
because ten to fourteen years intervened before the first missionary journey.</span></p>

not materially affect the point being made. It may, in fact, add weight to the
argument, because non-Pauline authorship is usually accompanied by a later date

in more direct opposition to the later tendency to distinguish them by the same
generations that were involved in formally delimiting the canon.</span></p>

as well as the way it <u>operates.</u> Over a period of fifteen years a man may
serve as elder in three churches, An evangelist during the same period of time
might minister in three localities. The difference is that eldership arises
from <u>within</u> a community of believers; an evangelist comes from <u>without</u>.
The evangelist circuits <u>as an evangelist</u> but an elder <u>as an elder</u>
does not. When he changes residence, he does not automatically become an elder
in the second church. He first identifies himself as a part of that community
and may then be chosen to serve as elder there. The evangelist changes
residence because he has changed ministry; the elder changes ministry because
he has changed residence. As they work, elders and evangelists may do many of
the same things.</span></p>

</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>could be taken in its usual meaning of “wives”
(<i>i.e</i>., of the deacons), as the Authorized Version translates: “their

not necessarily to widows serving as “deaconesses,” but to widows supported by
the church. In 1 Timothy<b> 3</b> Paul is talking about selecting persons. In 1
Timothy <b>5</b> he is talking about accepting applicants. Relevant passages

proposition of the Pharisees in <b>15</b>:5 and so is addressing them more than
those with whom he agreed. Peter seems to be addressing the Pharisees also when
he says to his antagonists, <i>“So now why are you tempting God by laying on
the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our fathers nor we were strong
enough to carry?”</i> The <i>“coming to one accord”</i> in <b>15</b>:25 may
mean doctrinal accord between the Pharisees and the others, or procedural
accord as to what should be done to counteract their influence. </span></p>

for authoritative proclamation of rulers (Luke <b>2</b>:1; Acts <b>17</b>:7)
and for authoritative elements of law (Ephesians <b>2</b>:15; Colossians <b>2</b>:14).

the <b>15</b>:20 parallel. “Laying on” picks up Peter’s terminology in <b>15</b>:10,
where he speaks of laying on the yoke of law. So the “laying on” in <b>15</b>:28
stands in contrast to, and less than, the laying on of law. <i>“No greater
burden than these necessary things”</i> (<b>15</b>:28-29) refers to matters of
basic morality true even before the law or the gospel, as distinguished from a
positive ordinance like circumcision, whereby a man became debtor to do the
whole law (Galatians <b>5</b>:3). The yoke of faith (<b>15</b>:11), which is <u>taken</u>
on, is easier, lesser, lighter (Matthew <b>11</b>:29-30) than the yoke of law
and may be laid on by charismatic proclamation aside from supervisory authority
both in the initial acceptance and subsequent obedience. Since those who had
gone out from Jerusalem were involved in doctrinal error, something had to be
said about Jerusalem’s position on these matters. <i>“In contrast to what the
Judaizing teachers have laid on you, we lay on you only these necessary things.”</i>
No positive argument for authoritative, conciliar action can come then from
Acts <b>15</b>:28.</span></p>
