<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The church is saved people serving in
divine pattern. The body of Christ possesses <u>essential</u> oneness by virtue
of individual unity with Christ and collective unity through Christ. This
invisible oneness is manifest by a dynamic structure-function called the
church. <u>Functional</u> unity in Christ combines with <u>organizational</u>
unity under Christ to form this non-denominational entity that has a fivefold
oneness of attitude, doctrine, fellowship, name, and organization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As a first major concern the historical
argument for non-denominationalism focuses particularly on the last of these
elements: the organizational pattern of the church established under direct
apostolic administration. Although the first four elements have probably never
been fully present in the visible church, sufficient evidence is available to
show that formal oneness did exist in the beginning.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In order to treat properly the subject of
apostolic church structure, a distinction must be made between <u>influence</u>
and <u>authority</u> and the compatibility of the two must be recognized. Those
positions that operate only through personal influence may be called “functions.”
Those that operate through legal authority may be called “offices.” Since the
church is a voluntary society, it operates as much as possible through personal
influence and then through legal right when necessary. Organization is
essentially the pattern of authority flow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A second useful distinction comes in
marking the difference between local and general. The perceived basic unit of
structure in the first century placed at the city level with household subunits
comprising the church in larger cities. Elements of organization can then be
described in terms of local vs. general and authoritative vs. purely
functional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>With these two sets of variables in hand,
data related to church pattern may be gathered and systematized. It is found
that there were three authoritative offices and three formal functions. Lord,
apostle, and elder were offices; evangelist, prophet, and deacon were
functions. Lord, apostle, evangelist, and prophet were general while elder and
deacon were local, elder being equated with bishop and pastor. Since
organization means the pattern of authority flow, the basic structure of the
first-century church was not elaborate. Christ exercised his lordship through
the twelve apostles at the general level; elders held office at the local
level. Evangelists and prophets functioned beyond the local church; deacons
served within it, evangelists often working with apostles as perhaps extensions
of the apostolic office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The second major concern is to set forth
facts and arguments showing the continuing normativeness of first-century basic
structure. Its divine origin must be emphasized in connection with the
principles of kingdom administration, which operates essentially from the top
down. Christ established the church indirectly through the apostles, whom he
had chosen for that purpose before the church was founded and begun to be
built. They in turn became the channel through whom the ascended King appointed
the other, subordinate offices and functions. Accordingly, Christ’s lordship is
to be considered the key to normativeness in that the level of initiation is
the level of amendment. The subjects do not alter the manner and form of
kingdom administration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Lord intended to keep the essential
pattern of the church. Since one universal form is exclusive of all other
parallel possibilities, the basic structure of the apostolic church is
normative until such time as Christ may reformulate the administration of the
reign of God. In the absence of Christ and the apostles, the church becomes a
series of congregations operating directly and only under the New Testament.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The conclusion for contemporary
Christendom is that the church express visibly and universally the spirit of
oneness that holds together the temple of God, that the churches dissolve
super-congregational authority, and that the churches become the church. Inasmuch
as organizational disunity indicates and reinforces more basic items of
concern, the church is exhorted today to press on to perfection in the attitude
of love, the orthodoxy of doctrine, and the fullness of fellowship.</span></p>
