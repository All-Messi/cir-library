style='font-size:12.0pt'>Christ’s lordship</span></u><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>. Jesus Christ is an <u>appointed</u> King of a <u>granted</u> kingdom
(Luke<b> 19</b>:12). The givenness of that entity includes its form—“kingdom”—as
well as the principles of kingdom government–formal authority prescriptively
applied. The organization of the church did not result from a natural process
of crystallization among the disciples of Jesus, for Jesus was not a teacher
like Socrates, who wrote nothing, founded nothing, and died, only to leave
behind a group of followers that evolved a tradition of thought and practice. As
to essential nature the church is kingdom as well as brotherhood. As regards
government, the church may be called a Christocratic monarchy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Jesus Christ is formal Head of the church.
<i>“All authority was <u>given</u> to me . . .”</i> (Matthew <b>28</b>:18; cp.
Daniel <b>7</b>:13-14; John <b>17</b>:2). It was given because of his
qualifications and did not arise directly out of his person so that Jesus
Christ leads not only by power and influence in interpersonal love, but also by
divine grant in impersonal law. His lordship, then, like his priesthood was by
power as well as commandment (Hebrews <b>5</b>:1-10; <b>7</b>:16); for the
Messiah was to be an eternal High-Priest King (Psalms <b>110</b>:1-4). In that
the church (1) <u>has</u> a Head who (2) <u>received</u> the headship (3) even <u>before</u>
the church existed through whose ranks he might naturally rise (John <b>13</b>:13),
the whole church–or the church <u>per se</u>–is placed in the category of
formal organization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>General statements re lower ranks</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. He to whom all authority was <u>given</u> in heaven
and on earth ascended from earth to heaven and gave gifts to men. He <u>gave</u>
some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,
pastor-teachers” (Ephesians<b> 4</b>:11). Similarly, Paul says again in
connection with Psalm<b> 68</b>:18, “God <u>set</u> some in the church, first
apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers” (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Particular statements re lower ranks</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Besides statements about the givenness of church
positions in general, passages dealing with individual offices and functions
are frequent. As the Lord said, “Authority was <u>given</u> to me” so also the
apostle Paul speaks of the “authority that the Lord <u>gave</u>” (2 Corinthians
<b>13</b>:10; cp. <b>10</b>:8; 1 Timothy <b>2</b>:7). In the headings of nine
epistles he mentions this fact.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> Perhaps
he does so because of the Judaizing teachers who were taking it on themselves
to “correct” the apostle’s teaching and leadership, and thus were false leaders
who <u>fashioned themselves</u> into apostles of Christ (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:13-15).
A man can no more make himself an apostle than he can make himself a saint (cp.
Romans <b>1</b>:5; 1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:1 + 2) or a worker of miracles (1
Corinthians<b>12</b>:28-30).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> That
the origin of the apostolate was formal rather than spontaneous is evident from
the fact that the apostles were chosen even before the church was established. That
they did not simply gravitate to the top among their peers is particularly
obvious in the case of Paul the persecutor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Eldership is an office “set in the church”
by God (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28), “given” by Christ (Ephesians <b>4</b>:11),
“made” by the Holy Spirit (Acts <b>20</b>: 28), “allotted” to certain qualified
men (1 Peter<b> 5</b>:3). The office, its qualifications, and first incumbents
were established by God. In leadership, givenness means formalness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As to evangelist, in the particular case of
Timothy the gift is said to have been given by Paul (2 Timothy <b>1</b>:6, </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>διά</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>),
with the presbytery (1 Timothy <b>4</b>:14, </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>μετά</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>), and by
prophecy (2 Timothy <b>1</b>:6; <b>4</b>:14, </span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>διά</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>). Acts <b>16</b>:1-3
is evidently the occasion to which these passages refer.<span style='position:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Enumerating qualifications accompanies
formal office so that deaconship is a formal function even though Paul does not
mention it in 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28 or Ephesians <b>4</b>:11. It is
significant that newly converted groups of believers were not left to organize
themselves as they might have seen fit (Acts <b>14</b>:23; cp. Titus <b>1</b>:5ff.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Establishing <u>persons</u> in a position
is distinguished, of course, from establishing the <u>position</u> itself, or
establishing the <u>responsibilities</u> resident in it. If only the former
were expressed in scripture, one might reason that God did not prescribe the
form of the church, but only permissively appointed certain personnel, such as
the elders of Ephesus, Matthias, and Timothy.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>4</span> First, appointment of persons necessarily implies
ratification of positions. God does not positively assist or credential what is
contrary to his will.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5</span> Secondly,
in 1 Corinthians <b>12</b> and Ephesians <b>4</b> Paul is not talking about, or
to, particular persons; so he must mean particular kinds of interdependent
ministries designed to help the church mature. He speaks particularly of
ministries, rather than the <u>ministering persons</u>, because he does not
have definite individuals in mind and because he draws attention to the purpose
of the responsibilities they have and the tasks they perform: the growth of the
church. The gifts of the Spirit are more particularly in view in 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:1,
“now concerning spiritual gifts . . . .” Thirdly, Paul is speaking of slots as
well as the slots’ responsibilities because he lists things that involve
clusters of responsibilities. If only functions were in mind he would speak of
them individually as he does in 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28b, 29b-30. Positions
of responsibility are also in view in 1 Corinthians <b>12</b> and Ephesians <b>4</b>.</span></p>

The givenness of Christ’s headship places the whole church in a system of
formal leadership. Whether viewed collectively or individually, the offices and
functions of the Christian church were formally bestowed from the <u>outside</u>
instead of spontaneously generated from the <u>inside</u>. Formal application
shows that (1) the church has organizational form in the strict sense instead
of being simply a community of persons drawn together by love alone. (2) Furthermore,
organization is not a matter of indifference in the body of Christ visible, and
all the more so when taken in connection with the considerations yet to be
developed. The church has a givenness in it regarding organization; its form is
the result of <u>formal application</u>.</span></p>

of church positions also directly indicate their <u>divine</u> givenness. Not
only did <i>“God <u>set</u> in the church . . . ,”</i> but <i>“<u>God</u> set
in the church apostles,”</i> <i>etc</i>. (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:28); <i>“<u>Christ</u>
gave apostles,”</i> <i>etc</i>. (Ephesians <b>4</b>:11); <i>“the <u>Holy Spirit</u>

top:-3.0pt'>6 </span>Divine application shows that the positions of service are
ultimately and essentially divine, being bestowed from <u>above</u> rather than
from <u>beside</u>. Different levels coming directly and indirectly from God,
the form of the church is the result of <u>divine application</u>. As Christ
was the proper starting point for <u>placing</u> the church in a formal
framework,<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> so he is the
proper starting point in the official <u>manner of placing</u> the church in
it. (1) According to Colossians <b>1</b>:15-19 together with Matthew <b>28</b>:18,
God the father was pleased with respect to the church to give <u>Christ</u> all
pre-eminence in heaven and on earth.</span></p>

his church</u> on the living truth of the great confession.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> “I will build my church” has a
historical thrust. It involves a crisis and a process. The Christ the Son of
the living God was going to establish his kingdom and build his church, and the
grave (“Hades”) was not going to stop him (<b>16</b>:18 + 21) nor overpower it
(<b>16</b>:18).</span></p>

thing as Jesus spoke.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> He

directed the apostles adding together their converts under elders–all this in

prediction, the book of Acts shows that Christ’s building of the church
(Matthew <b>16</b>:18-19) was fulfilled indirectly through apostolic agency
guided by the Holy Spirit. Conversely, the gospel prediction shows that what
his apostles were doing was his doing.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>14</span> Official application refers to the manner in which the
pattern of the church unfolded from the Father, through Christ, through the
apostles, to the elders. The form of the church then is a result of <u>official

build his church (Matthew <b>16</b>:18) is followed by an explanation of <u>how</u>
he intended to do it: indirectly through the agency of the apostles (Matthew <b>16</b>:19;
<b>18</b>:18): <i>“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and
whatever you bind on earth will certainly be bound in heaven, and whatever you
loose on earth will certainly be loosed in heaven.”</i><span style='position:

from what the apostles did and taught in his name. Everything they did and

in church organization has been traced from Christ’s prediction to build the

that Christ is an authoritative Head, the whole church is put in the category
of authority. In an earlier section it was argued that the apostles he thus
commissioned had supervisory authority.<span style='position:relative;

predicted in Matthew <b>16</b>:18-19. Since the apostles were authoritative as

tribes of Israel (cp. Revelation <b>4</b>:4; <b>11</b>:16; <b>20</b>:4). Christ
appointed to them a kingdom as the Father had appointed to him (Luke <b>22</b>:29).
After the great white throne judgment (Revelation <b>20</b>:11-15), there is
the coming of the new heaven, the new earth, and the new Jerusalem (Revelation<b>

city figure in Hebrews <b>11</b>:10 (14), 16; <b>12</b>:22 (28); <b>13</b>:14

adjustments were made in the visible functioning of polity: (1) Christ passed
into heaven; (2) the apostles beginning with James also passed from the scene;
(3) the prophetic gift was not necessarily continued. These three positions,
however, still operate <i>in absentia </i>through the written word. Elders,
deacons, and evangelists are the permanent gifts by which <i>“all the body is
fitly framed together . . . to the building up of itself in love.” </i>Intended
permanence eliminates <u>successive</u> variation in the essential pattern of
the church. The manner and form of this kingdom’s administration was not going
to be altered by the <u>Lord</u>.</span></p>

injunction is restriction, silence is prohibition, addition is contradiction,

things are true of the building of the church: (a) theologically it is built on
Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians <b>3</b>:10-15); (b) historically it is built on
the apostles and prophets among whom Peter (and Paul) was especially prominent
(Ephesians<b> 2</b>:19-22; cp. Revelation<b> 21</b>:14); (c) logically it is
built on the facts included in Peter’s confession (Matthew <b>16</b>:16-18). “This
rock” in Matthew <b>16</b>:18 is taken here as a reference to the content of
Peter’s confession for two reasons: (1) the confession is the only appropriate
contextual element standing in third person to both Jesus and Peter. Jesus does
not say,” On you/myself I will build my church,” though by either statement
something true could be meant (argument from grammatical person). (2) Both
Jesus and Peter are elsewhere in the building figure respectively as builder
and turnkey (argument from rhetorical figure). Furthermore, as respects Peter,
(3) the word change from </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>Πέτρος</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> to </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>πέτρα</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> (“this <u>rock</u>”) in Matthew’s Greek history
evidently reflects an distinction meant originally by Jesus in Aramaic. In

promise in John <b>16</b>:13 that the Spirit would lead into all truth was
directed to the apostles. It appears in those chapters (<b>13-17</b>) that
record the upper-room events on the night before the crucifixion; only the
apostles were present. It is this promise that the resurrected Christ
reiterates in Acts 1 when he tells the apostles to wait in Jerusalem for “the
promise of the Father” (<b>1</b>:4). Thus enabled, <u>then</u>, they would
become the special resurrection eyewitnesses they were chosen to be (<b>1</b>:8).
At Pentecost the Spirit descended on the apostles (not the 120) in fulfillment
of this promise, and in consequence they established the church historically
(cp. Ephesians <b>3</b>:19-22), theologically (cp. 1 Corinthians <b>3</b>:10-11),
and organizationally (cp. Acts <b>20</b>:28) under his guidance. The <u>indwelling

Greek future perfect passives are rendered here as emphatic futures so as to
express the idea diagrammed as “Process B” in the accompanying figure. Translating
into an English future perfect passive would express the idea diagrammed as “Process
A.” Both concepts are true, but the Greek idiom does not necessarily support
the second possibility even though the translation committee of the New
American Standard Version has recently adopted this rendering. See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>,
pp. 906-7; W. W. Goodwin, <i>A Greek Grammar</i>, p. 271; Moule, <i>Idiom Book</i>,

mechanism related in basic nature to the prophetic perfect in Hebrew; see E.
Kautzsch and A. E. Cowley, <i>Gesenius’ Hebrew Grammar</i>, pp. 312-13. If one
were to take the alternate rendering, it would only add more weight to the
point being made at this juncture. </span></p>

guidance in matters of organization because as yet Jesus seems not to have
taught the apostles much about it. The disciples, expecting a restoration of
the kingdom to Israel (Acts <b>1</b>:6), were not ready for something so radically
different as the church (John <b>16</b>:12). The Spirit’s ministry to the
apostles was not simply that of bringing to their memory the teaching of Jesus
(John <b>14</b>:26). It was a guidance into new matters as well that the Spirit

position advocated here relative to church organization is not to be confused
with the Roman Catholic view of the passage: (1) Peter is not viewed as
vocationally peculiar to his fellow apostles. (2) Apostolic succession is not
advocated (see pp. 81-82, fnt. 3). (3) The permanent pattern for the church was
given by God, the apostles acting only as the agents of establishment. The two
views are alike only as to the general manner of <u>origination</u> with
greater stress placed on “Process A” in Fig. 13. For a presentation and
criticism of the Roman usage of “the three texts” (Matthew <b>16</b>:13-20;

classes of presumptive evidence may be noted in passing. (a) Normally one
expects the “purpose” to be the “patterner” as a consequence of <u>right</u>
and <u>qualification</u>. The nature and purpose of the church was a mystery
until it was revealed (Ephesians <b>2</b>:11-<b>3</b>:13). Because of their
typical human ethnocentrism, the apostles unaided were not appropriate
designers of a universal, cross-cultural, and spiritual kingdom (cp. Acts <b>1</b>:6-7;
<b>10</b>:1-<b>11</b>:18). The form of anything must be amenable to its nature
and purpose. The simplicity of the church’s organization enables it to operate
manageably in any culture and to have the cross-cultural continuity
characteristic of a united universal community. (b) On the analogy of Israel,
one would not expect God in the institution of his economies to be indifferent
to the form of his people. The divine origin of Israel’s national government
becomes apparent in Israel’s demand for a king. They were not free apart from
his directive to change from a system of charismatic judges to a hereditary
monarchy (1 Samuel<b> 8</b>). Divine prerogative is apparent also in the change
of dynasty from Saul to David. Even Jethro’s advice about a judiciary system
was conditioned with <i>“if . . . God command you”</i> (Exodus <b>18</b>:23). God
<u>gave</u> the Israelites judges, he <u>gave</u> them Saul, and he <u>raised
up</u> for them David (Acts <b>13</b>:20-22 + corresponding “raised-up”
passages in the Old Testament).</span></p>

having authoritative patterns would still be a “form.” The church in such case

Christian church is not constitutionally a continuation of national Israel or a
sect of Judaism. On the basis of Psalms <b>110</b>:4; Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-35;
and Psalms <b>40</b>:6-8, Hebrews sets forth the “anotherness” of the new
covenant. Israel’s constitution was changed (<b>7</b>:12), disannulled (<b>7</b>:18),
taken away (<b>10</b>:9); and vanished (<b>8</b>:9). The Christian system was
the second of which Mosaism was the first (<b>8</b>:7; <b>9</b>:1; <b>10</b>:9).
It was the new that came after the old (<b>8</b>:8, 13). There is covenantal
continuity of purpose from Abraham forward but dispensational discontinuity of
orders. </span></p>

perpetuation of the church and its ministry depended on conformity to the

writers that the charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit were still exercised in
the second and third centuries. Not only in the remote church or churches from
which the Didache sprang, but at Rome in the days of Hermas, and in South Gaul
within the memory of Irenaeus, prophets delivered their message in Christian
assemblies. Even in the middle of the fourth century Cyril of Jerusalem thought
it possible that some of his catechumens might receive prophetic powers at
their baptism. Nor were the miraculous operations of the Spirit altogether
withdrawn from the ancient Church, if we may trust the testimony of Irenaeus
and Origen, and the half reluctant witness of Theodore. “But upon the whole the
references in post-apostolic writings to ‘workings of miracles’ and prophecy
are relatively few, while on the other hand there is a growing insistence on
the spiritual and ethical effects of the Spirit’s indwelling in the hearts of

may be possible to infer from the foundation figure in Ephesians <b>2</b>:20
that the ministry of prophets was like that of Christ and the apostles in being

them. If this inference is correct, it speaks to the temporary nature of the
prophetic function. That <u>New Testament</u> prophets are meant is obvious
from Ephesians <b>3</b>:4-5, where the previous mystery of Christ is said to
have been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets.</span></p>

in the argument of Hebrews<b> 7</b>:12-14 (cp. <b>8</b>:4) is the principle
that injunction is restriction, and silence is prohibition in organizational
matters. The writer argues that Jesus son of <u>Judah</u> is prohibited from
the priesthood under the Mosaic law because it enjoins priesthood to sons of <u>Levi</u>:
<i>“It is evident that our Lord has descended from Judah as to which tribe
Moses spoke nothing about priests.”</i> From the subsequent oath-appointment of
a priest in Psalm <b>110</b>:4, he infers that the law would have to be changed
in order for this new priesthood to function legitimately. All organizational
matters, whether qualifications for offices, the presence of offices themselves,
or the total pattern, are subject to the principle of injunction-restriction. The
New Testament would have to be changed for another system of government to
function legitimately.</span></p>

affirmation that other <u>did</u> exist does not derive from the inability to

that conclusion as if, for example, subapostolic practices could create

Testament sources, arguments from patristic teaching and practice have not been
treated. Suffice it to say that the method of determining orthodoxy on
patristic evidence alone or primarily, relies too heavily on possible
association with apostles and nearness to the apostolic age as bases for
purity. At best, the testimony of early Christian literature is confirmatory
evidence for matters already founded on the positive teaching of the New
Testament taken alone, not the other way around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The following reasons seem to justify a
healthy skepticism of innovations in subapostolic times. (1) <u>Widespread
errors were creeping into the church even while the apostles were still
actively on the scene</u>: incipient gnosticism (cp. John Rutherfurd, “Gnosticism,”
<i>ISBE</i>, Vol. II, pp. 1240-48), which in turn led to antinomianism (cp.
William Young, “Antinomianism,” <i>EC</i>, Vol., IV, pp. 270-79). Paul warned
about later heresies springing up even among leaders <u>who knew him</u> (Acts <b>20</b>:29-30;
1 Timothy <b>4</b>:1-5; 2 Timothy <b>3</b>:1-9; <b>4</b>:3. See also 2
Corinthians <b>11</b>:13; Galatians <b>1</b>:7; <b>2</b>:4). Jude writes that
already in his day false teachers were rising up as the apostles had predicted
(17-18, probably in reference to 2 Peter <b>2</b>:1;<b> 3</b>:2-3 and the above
references in Paul; note 2 Peter <b>3</b>:14-18). John speaks of these false
leaders also (Revelation <b>2</b>:12-29). In less than twenty years a goodly
number of Judaizing teachers were already leading the early Christians into
heresy under the opposition of the apostles. What would happen when the
apostles were gone? It hardly seems advisable to rest a case on second-century
leaders who might have been able to count some of the apostles among their
acquaintances or whose lives reached back into the apostolic era, when in the
apostolic age itself error was already reaching significant proportions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, (2) <u>the early Christian
writers were in error on some points immediately associated with organization</u>.
The New Testament uses <i>bishop</i> and <i>elder</i> interchangeably, knowing
nothing of the subsequent practice that separated the terms and created an
office superior to the local elder (see Chapter III). The extravagant
affirmations of Ignatius and Irenaeus, who advocated respectively the
patristic-type bishop as center of Christian unity and depository of apostolic
tradition, seem to stand in contradiction to the implications of Acts<b> 11</b>:23,
where the groups of Christians are called “churches” before such leadership was
ever appointed in that area. The New Testament views the church first as people
and then as pattern, the order being reversed by later tendencies. For a
collection of strong statements re bishops in early Christian literature, see
Lightfoot, <i>Philippians</i>, pp. 234ff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) <u>Historical allusions into the
apostolic age may not be independent witness to the facts</u>. In certain
instances, patristic writers may only have read back into the inspired
documents the practices of their own day, and on that basis may have failed to
distinguish between the power of superior personal influence and the authority
of superior office as in the case of James the Lord’s brother (Acts <b>12</b>:17;
<b>15</b>:13-29; <b>21</b>:18; Galatians <b>1</b>:19; <b>2</b>:9-12). It is
safer to depend on the inspired writings of eyewitnesses than on oral tradition
that is later recorded.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (4) It is only natural that as Greek
philosophy infiltrated Christian theology, <u>Roman government should affect
church polity</u>. As doctrine was subject to perversion, organization was
subject to a crystallizing, authoritarian change, especially in the face of
potential division caused by the Gnostic, Marcionite, and Montanist movements
against, and from within, the church (cp. Kenneth Scott Latourette, <i>A
History of Christianity</i>, pp. 119-33).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (5) <u>Social evolution</u>, led by lesser
lights and left unchecked by the apostles’ correcting influence, <u>is
sufficient to account for the state of affairs</u> in a “second-generation”
church that felt a need to fill the perceived vacuum left by the absence of the
“first-generation” apostles. The drift from influence to authority and general
function to general authority are two particular components of the patristic
alteration in polity. One does not need to suppose that there had been sanction
of these practices in unrecorded apostolic history in order to account for
their widespread appearance later in the church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The evaluation, then, of patristic
teaching and New Testament teaching must follow three principles: (a) where
they agree patristic evidence confirms; (b) where they disagree the New
Testament takes preference; (c) where the New Testament is indecisive patristic
practice is indeterminate. The question of church polity falls in the second
category because the New Testament is sufficiently clear and patristic practice
is different, a difference which by the nature of church polity is not only
contrary, but incompatible.</span></p>

possibility of having functions “outside” and “below” the prescribed pattern is
sometimes not recognized perhaps because of a failure to perceive the exact
nature of what organization is; see, <i>e.g</i>., “The Divine Organization Is

New Testament pattern of unity is exclusive of (a) pluralism and (b)
hierarchism. It is also exclusive of (c) free-church confederacy, but for
different reasons. Since those reasons derive from theological and functional,
rather than organizational, considerations, a discussion of them falls outside
the precise scope of this thesis. Nevertheless some observations may be made in
passing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In connection with (1) <u>hierarchism,</u>
the doctrine of local autonomy in the free-church and baptistic tradition may
not be precluded by delegated conventions in that the downward flow of
jurisdictional authority is not interrupted in principle. The decisions and
policies made by delegates may be repudiated by the local churches without
legal recourse by the convention. One questions from an expediency viewpoint,
however, the advisability of having such strong influence over the whole church
concentrated in so relatively few persons. The International Convention of the
Disciples of Christ is a case in point; see James DeForest Murch, <i>Christians
Only</i>.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Secondly, though corporate decision making
may enhance the functional efficiency of the total cause, what is gained in
efficiency may be lost in interest due to less direct connection between the
local source of funds and the place of their ultimate use. The point is not so
much efficiency as it is effectiveness. Furthermore, in some cases a tendency
toward bureaucracy may end up less efficient than the direct-support approach. For
other areas of evaluating direct- support missions, see Sam E. Stone, “The
Advantages and Disadvantages for Direct-Support Missions to the Local Church,” <i>Christian
Standard</i>, September 14, 1968, pp. 5-7. Even if there were only one
confederate system of congregations, these problems would demand careful
consideration.</span></p>

one may say that the generating causes of parallel free-church systems are the
same as the generating causes for parallel hierarchical systems–doctrinal
peculiarities, <i>etc</i>. A series of free-church confederacies presents the
same problem as a series of hierarchical denominations. As regards the total
picture seen by the world, a series of separate free-church fellowships is
still less than a unified whole.</span></p>
