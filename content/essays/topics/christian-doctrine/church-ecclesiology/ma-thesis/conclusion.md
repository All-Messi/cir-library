<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The church is saved people serving in
divine pattern. The body of Christ possesses <u>essential</u> oneness by virtue
of individual unity with Christ and collective unity through Christ. This
invisible oneness is manifest by a dynamic structure-function called the
church. <u>Functional</u> unity in Christ combines with <u>organizational</u>
unity under Christ to form this non-denominational entity that has a fivefold
oneness of attitude, doctrine, fellowship, name, and organization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As a first major concern the historical
argument for non-denominationalism focused particularly on the last of these
elements: the organizational pattern of the church established under direct
apostolic administration. Although the first four elements have probably never
been fully present in the visible church, it was anticipated that sufficient
evidence was available to show that formal oneness did exist in the beginning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In order to treat properly the subject of
apostolic church structure, a distinction was made between <u>influence</u> and
<u>authority</u> and the compatibility of the two was explained. Those
positions that operate only through personal influence were called “functions”;
those that operate through legal authority were called “offices.” Since the
church is a voluntary society, it operates as much as possible through personal
influence and then through legal right when necessary. Organization is
essentially the pattern of authority flow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A second useful distinction came in
marking the difference between <u>local</u> and <u>general</u>. The perceived
basic unity of structure in the first century was placed at the city level with
household subunits comprising the church in larger cities. Elements of
organization could then be described in terms of local <i>vs</i>. general and
authoritative <i>vs</i>. purely functional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>With these two sets of variables in hand,
data related to this study’s first concern was gathered and systematized. It
was found that there were three authoritative offices and three formal
functions. Lord, apostle, and elder were offices; evangelist, prophet, and
deacon were functions. Lord, apostle, evangelist, and prophet were general
while elder and deacon were local, elder being equated with bishop and pastor. Since
organization means the pattern of authority flow, the basic structure of the
first-century church was not elaborate. Christ exercised his lordship through
the twelve apostles at the general level. Elders held office at the local
level. Evangelists and prophets functioned beyond the local church. Deacons
served within it, evangelists often working with apostles as perhaps extensions
of the apostolic office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The second major concern was to set forth
facts and argument showing the continuing normativeness of first-century basic
structure. Its divine origin was emphasized in connection with the principles
of kingdom administration, which operates essentially from the top down. Christ
established the church indirectly through the apostles, whom he had chosen for
that purpose before the church was founded and begun to be built. They in turn
became the channel through whom the ascended King appointed the other, subordinate
offices and functions. Accordingly, Christ’s lordship was considered the key to
normativeness in that the level of initiation is the level of amendment. The
subjects do not alter the manner and form of kingdom administration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Lord intended to keep the essential
pattern of the church. Since one universal form is exclusive of all other
parallel possibilities, the basic structure of the apostolic church is
normative until such time as Christ may reformulate the administration of the
reign of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The conclusion for contemporary
Christendom is that the church express visibly and universally the spirit of
oneness that holds together the temple of God, that the churches dissolve
super-congregational authority, and that the churches become the church. Inasmuch
as organizational disunity indicates and reinforces more basic items of
concern, the church is exhorted today to press on to perfection in the attitude
of love, the orthodoxy of doctrine, and the fullness of fellowship.</span></p>
