argument for organizational church unity. <i>The New Testament Basis for the
Non-Denominational Church: The Historical Argument</i> is used as the title for
two reasons especially: (1) clarity–a concept is most definite in the context
of contrast; (2) relevance–denominationalism is a feature of contemporary
Christendom that stands in contrast to what will be presented as the nature of
the church’s unity according to the New Testament.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

himself prayed for the oneness of his disciples even before the church was
established.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1 </span>His apostles
sought to preserve its original unity by teaching, exhortation, labor, and
warning; consequently, a significant portion of the New Testament deals with
Christian unity. <i>“In unity there is strength”</i> endures as a principle for
all social endeavor. One may add that in unity there is peace, a most prominent
thought in the minds of men today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

about division because of their influence in foreign missions, lest they spread
division into pioneer areas. Furthermore, as the world becomes one community
through mass media and international travel, the inherent oneness of mankind
becomes more evident, and the unity-of-mankind function of the church makes its
own lack of unity more incongruous.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Denominationalism is marked by at least
five related features: (1) exclusivistic attitude, (2) peculiar doctrine, (3)
restricted fellowship, (4) distinguishing names, (5) organizational
separateness. Perhaps the most basic and deadly of the five is the attitude of
exclusivism. Presumably doctrinal disagreement also contributes largely to
disunity. These two marks, one personal and the other doctrinal, produce the
other three and are reinforced in turn by them. All these characteristics are
not always present in a given Christian fellowship, but together they form the
complex involved in contemporary denominationalism as a whole. To the last of
these this thesis addresses itself most particularly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Within the larger topic of
denominationalism, the first special concern of this study is to outline the
organizational form of church unity in the first century. In order to do that
meaningfully, the thesis seeks to show the relationship of organization to
other topics connected with it (Chapter 1), to delineate clearly the
characteristics of authority vs. influence, and to define local vs. general
(Chapter<b> </b>2).<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> Then a
positive presentation of first-century non-denominational structure is given
(Chapter 3).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The second special concern is
to present evidence and argument for the normativeness of apostolic church
pattern (Chapter 4). Reasons will be given for concluding that the original
form should continue today. This last matter seems to be assumed in treatments
of twentieth-century polity by those who may agree essentially with the view
presented herein. The author therefore seeks to give particular attention to
the normativeness of first-century form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Bible is the word of God written. It
is the accurate record of redemptive history, the authoritative statement of
propositional revelation. It is the account of the deeds of God among men and
the message of God to men. It both narrates event and interprets meaning. The
scripture is verbally God-breathed in the sense that every man’s word in it is
appropriate for expressing the reality-truth God intended to convey to men
through human language. It is adequate to lead men into all the truth they need
to know in order to meet the responsibility they have been given. Therefore,
the Bible rightly divided is now constitutionally authoritative over the hearts
and minds and lives of free men in all matters whereof it speaks. The total
approach of this thesis is within the historico-grammatical Biblical
hermeneutic.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span></span></p>

Division</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The doctrine of church unity must be
considered in terms of the correct set of distinctions. The problem of disunity
cannot be resolved on what may be called the “visible-invisible” distinction. “Invisible
church” means the people who are really saved; “visible church” means those who
are viewed as Christians. “Invisible unity,” therefore, refers to the oneness
of the saved in their being saved. It is essentially a definitional statement
that joins soteriology and ecclesiology. “Visible unity” refers to the
functional association of those seen as the church. Resolving division by an
appeal to the invisible-church concept attempts to give a semantic answer to a
real problem.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7 </span>It attempts to
solve the problem with the <u>mind</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The problem of unity must be resolved in
terms that include distinctions between the <u>kinds</u> of organizational
oneness. Proliferation of denominations in the last four hundred years has
prepared evangelicals today to resolve the problem of division in the mind
rather than in the world. The corresponding behavioral response is a pattern of
interdenominational cooperation or a movement toward no church organization at
all. In reacting against the wrong <u>thesis</u> regarding church unity (a
corrupt, visible, hierarchical authoritarianism), Christians have adopted the
wrong <u>antithesis</u> (an incorruptible, invisible status) so that they
practice an inadequate <u>synthesis</u> (interdenominational cooperation).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> In the words of W. A. Visser’t
Hooft, <i>“ . . . we cannot and dare not go back to the ‘as if’ theology which
demands that we shall act ‘as if’ we were one faith.”</i><span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9</span> Whereas historically
interdenominationalism may prove to be one possible route toward
non-denominationalism, evangelicals may never get beyond it if the need for
universal, visible, functional, organizational oneness is not kept before the
attention.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10</span> Disunity is not
solved simply (1) in <u>concept</u> or (2) in <u>cooperation</u>, but (3) in <u>conformity</u>
to a given standard that includes organization as well as other, dynamic
factors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The problem of unity must be resolved in
terms of a divine standard. Christians within mutually exclusive polities will
probably not be able to discover and adopt a mutually satisfactory polity. This
writer is of the opinion that Christian unity, including its organizational
expression, will never exist aside from a prescriptive divine standard.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11</span> There seems to be no <u>prima
facie</u> reason for supposing that the New Testament presents insufficient
data for determining either the content or form of apostolic unity. On the
contrary, the strong concern for visible oneness creates the opposite
presumption. If the form of church unity cannot be resolved from the New
Testament, it will not be resolved.</span></p>

evident fluctuation between technical and general usage of the same word and
the seeming multiplication of terms for the same office. Since the primary
sources do not accommodate themselves terminologically to the distinctions and
sets of contrasts inherent in problems arising later, candor requires caution
in some passages and general avoidance of conclusions based solely on words. (1)

style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The <u>form of the church</u> must be compatible
with the <u>form of salvation</u>. There is only one system of salvation promised
in the New Testament (Ephesians <b>4</b>:4). One <u>basis of salvation</u> has
been laid and “there is no other name under heaven given among men by whom it
is necessary for us to be saved” (Acts <b>4</b>:12). One <u>appropriation of
salvation</u> has been offered whereby God particularizes and applies the
salvation principle to the individual: <i>“ . . . justified by faith apart from
works of law”</i> (Romans <b>3</b>:27). There is one faith–<u>the</u> faith
(Ephesians <b>4</b>:4; Jude 3). Christians are those baptized into one body, who
drink from one Spirit (1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:13), and partake of the same cup
and loaf (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:16-17; <b>12</b>:4-6). If there is only one
salvation process and status, saved people collectively should not order
themselves so that the world may ask any one of them, “To which church do you
belong?” The church cannot be characterized in its <u>form</u> by what is
contradictory to its <u>content</u>.</span></p>

.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Proposition two</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The <u>real form</u> of the church must be
compatible with its <u>ideal purpose</u>. The goal and purpose of the church is
to create a new, united mankind (Ephesians<b> 2</b>:15). In Christ there is
neither Jew nor Gentile (ethnic), bond nor free (societal), male nor female
(physical), rich nor poor (economic) because Christ broke down the “middle wall
of separation” between them (Galatians <b>3</b>:28; Ephesians <b>2</b>:11-18). An
agent of unification cannot itself be characterized by division. Furthermore,
denominationalism tens to follow the rifts in secular society<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> so that the church is influenced
by the world in this matter rather than vice versa.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>13</span> The church cannot be characterized in its <u>form</u> by
what is antithetical to its <u>purpose</u>.</span></p>

.5in'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Proposition three</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The <u>visible form</u> of the church must be
compatible with its <u>invisible content</u>. Although with the mind a person
can distinguish between the visible and invisible church, God did not intend
any real distinction in extent or character. People enter the church visible
and invisible at the same time and on the same conditions, and only those who
possess righteous status and character are to be considered part of either. With
reference to these things, it is because of human uncertainty that the
visible-invisible distinction is made, rather than because of divine intent or
real truth. As to extent and character, the difference exists in the
perception, not in the reality. If division is definitionally impossible and
descriptively wrong, it cannot be made indifferent in the visible church on the
basis of the visible-invisible distinction. “The Church of Christ upon earth is
essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one.”<span style='position:
relative;top:-3.0pt'>14</span> The church is invisibly one, hence, visibly one.
It cannot be characterized in its <u>expression</u> by what is eliminated from

style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The functional form of the <u>universal</u> church
must be compatible with the required character of the <u>local</u> body of
Christ. The whole cannot be characterized by what is condemned in its parts. Paul’s
admonitions to the Corinthians at the local level are therefore applicable by
extension to the universal church. As to the problem of <u>peculiar doctrine</u>,
he beseeches them to <i>“say the same things”</i> (1 Corinthians<b> 1</b>:10; <b>15</b>:12).
As to <u>distinguishing names</u>, he commands them not to “glory in men” (<b>3</b>:21)
saying, <i>“I belong to Paul”</i> (<b>3</b>:22;<b> 1</b>:12) because they all <i>“belong
to Christ”</i> (<b>3</b>:23). As to <u>exclusivistic attitude</u>, he reminds
them that one Christian does not differ from another because everyone has
received what he possesses (<b>4</b>:7). As to <u>restrictive fellowship</u>,
there is one loaf for the many members (<b>10</b>:17; <b>11</b>:17ff.). There
is to be no pride in the attitude (<b>4</b>:7), no factions in the fellowship (<b>11</b>:18),
no distinctions in the nomenclature (<b>1</b>:12; <b>3</b>:22), no schism in
the body (<b>12</b>:25), for the temple is holy (<b>3</b>:16-17). As in one
church, so in all; hence, so in the whole. What is condemned in the <u>parts</u>
cannot be condoned in the <u>whole</u>.</span></p>

is weakness and brings destruction (Luke <b>11</b>:18). This truth gives rise

not so strong when division exists in the ranks of the church. One purpose in
Christ’s high priestly prayer for Christian unity was “that the world may know

observations militate negatively against denominationalism, but they do not
determine positively what form that unity will take. The historical argument,
however, provides the positive replacement for contemporary division by
describing the original pattern and arguing for its normativeness. The
organization of the church is normative by virtue of prescriptive divine
origin, intended permanence, and necessary exclusiveness. It cannot be

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The author takes the view that the church came into
being on Pentecost. It was not established before or during the ministry of
John or Jesus. (1) Christ himself made straightforward statements to the effect
that the church was yet to come: Matthew <b>16</b>:18; cp. Luke <b>19</b>:<u>11</u>-15.
(2) The law of Moses was still binding (Matthew <b>23</b>:1-3). There cannot be
two constitutions in effect simultaneously over one people. With the coming of
the New the Old was <u>removed</u> (Colossians <b>2</b>:13-15; Hebrews <b>7</b>:12,
18;<b> 8</b>:9, 13; <b>10</b>:9). (3) A testament is not in force till the
death of the testator (Hebrews <b>9</b>:16-17). (4) It was not appropriate that
the founding of the church should have preceded the historical foundation on
which it is based: the death-resurrection of Christ. (5) The Jewish limitations
were still in force during Christ’s earthly ministry (Matthew <b>10</b>:5-6).</span></p>

in this thesis derives from the fact that form is the subject at hand, and does

nevertheless a part of revelation regarding the church.</span></p>

of <i>Man’s Disorder and God’s Design: The Amsterdam Assembly Series</i>, ed.
by W. A. Visser’t Hooft, p. 184. The “as-if” approach of which he speaks is the
mechanism behind interdenominational activities like saturation evangelism and
evangelism-in-depth. Such activity is better than open hostility, but tends to
delay the achievement of full, or true, unity by minimizing the need for it
since a tolerable state of relationship has been reached. It becomes an
alternative to conflict that falls short of peace. The social mechanisms
involved are discussed in Paul B. Horton and Chester L. Hunt, <i>Sociology</i>,
