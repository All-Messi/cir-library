style='font-size:12.0pt'>Two Word Meanings</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christians sometimes ask whether there are
apostles in the church today. To answer the question, we must clarify what it
means because the New Testament uses <i>apostle</i> in more than one way. Its
general sense refers to someone who is “sent,” which makes it a synonym for <u>missionary</u>.
In its technical usage, <i>apostle</i> refers to a group of men, fourteen in
number, who had additional specialized qualifications: they were direct
witnesses of the resurrected Christ (except for Judas Iscariot), directly
chosen and commissioned by Christ, directly endowed with their message,
directly guided in their work, and directly empowered by the Spirit. (See “Paul
as Primary Apostle.”). <i>“You tried the ones that call themselves apostles and
aren’t”</i> (Revelation <b>2</b>:2) implies that some apostles were distinguishable
from other apostles. If all apostles were simply traveling evangelists or
insightful men differing only in degree, they could be called apostles. Denying
the claim would be like denying that someone was a missionary. They were in
fact traveling, they were in fact insightful if they were, and they were in
fact sent from somewhere. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            So the question about modern “apostles”
can be answered “yes” or “no,” depending on the meaning of the word. If the
question is about apostles in the technical sense, then for reasons given below
we answer “no.” If the question is simply about apostles in the general sense
of “sent ones,” we can answer “yes.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is another way in which we can
answer “yes” about apostles today: we have the same apostles today that they
had in the first century. The New Testament is their witness in written form because
it came from the apostles themselves and from men that served as extensions of
their office—men who worked and wrote under the apostles' direction. They wrote
the New Testament to preserve and multiply the apostolic testimony, as 2 Peter
says, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“As
long as I am in this tabernacle, I think it’s right to stir you up by putting
you in remembrance, knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle comes soon .
. . that at every time after my decease you can call these things to mind” </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<b>1</b>:13-15; cp.<b> 3</b>:1-2). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Reasons for Caution</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Usually, people that ask about apostles
today are thinking of <i>apostle</i> in the primary sense, and they ask because
they have encountered someone that claims to be one. We would do well to be
cautious even if we lived in the first century, because there were false
apostles even then (2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:13; Revelation<b> 2</b>:2). If
there was no question about the existence of apostles, prophets, miraculous
manifestation, and the like, we would still need to apply the tests discussed
below (See also <i>Gifts of the Spirit: Supplementary Notes</i>, pp. 43-47 +
48-58).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We also do well to exercise a healthy
skepticism since the New Testament gives <u>no reason for</u> believing that
the original apostles had successors in the Christian era any more than Moses
did in the Mosaic period. Moses and the apostles served as God’s normative
spokesmen in their respective dispensations (Deuteronomy <b>18</b>:15-22; Galatians
<b>1</b>:8-9; Romans <b>16</b>:17; 2 Peter <b>1</b>:15-<b>3</b>:18).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We have <u>significant reasons against</u>
supposing the existence of subsequent apostles. These reasons apply differently
whether we are dealing with the Roman Catholic sense of apostolic
succession—like kingship—or with something like Old Testament judges or
prophets, whom God raised up individually as needed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            First, we note that (a) even in the Mosaic
period there was not always a prophet among the Israelites, notably during the
four-hundred-year period between Malachi and John the Baptist. During those
times, the nation could surely have benefited from special divine guidance. Even
when there were prophets, they were not available everywhere in the nation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (b) When Herod executed James the brother
of John, no successor was appointed (Acts<b> 12</b>:1ff.) as there was when
Judas vacated his office (Acts <b>1</b>:15-<u>25</u>). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (c) Scripture speaks of twelve apostles for
all time. Jesus said the Twelve would sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve
tribes of Israel (Mathew <b>19</b>:28; Luke <b>22</b>:30). Even in Revelation after
the church age, there are twelve apostles, not hundreds (<b>21</b>:14). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, (d) an eyewitness cannot have
a successor, and giving eyewitness testimony to Christ’s resurrection was a
distinctive function of the apostles (Acts <b>1</b>:6-8; <b>1</b>:21ff.; <b>2</b>:32;
<b>4</b>:33 [“their witness”], <b>10</b>:39-43;<b> 26</b>:15-16; 1 Corinthians <b>9</b>:1?).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Testing Apostolic Claimants</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since there are reasons to be skeptical
about apostolic claims, we must try <i>“the ones that call themselves apostles
and aren’t”</i> (Revelation <b>2</b>:2; cp. 2 Corinthians <b>11</b>:13). For
one thing, Paul alludes to <i>“the signs of an apostle”</i> (2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:12),
presumably referring to miraculous confirmation of his apostleship. Genuine
miracle corresponds with new revelation because new revelation is not necessarily
subject to the doctrinal test, the test for whether supposed revelation
harmonizes with previous revelation (Deuteronomy <b>13</b>:1-5; Mark <b>2</b>:5-10;
Galatians <b>1</b>:8-9). Additionally, apostles have to meet the moral test (Mark
<b>9</b>:39; John <b>9</b>:16, 31) and the test of whether their activities
glorify God and benefit others rather than draw attention to themselves (Matthew<b>
4</b>:5-7 = Luke <b>4</b>:9-12) or benefit themselves (cp. Acts <b>16</b>:16-18;
1 Corinthians <b>13-14</b> [love and edification of others]; Matthew <b>4</b>:3-4
= Luke <b>3</b>:4-5). Since someone might meet these tests without being a
primary apostle, we expect miraculous confirmation of apostles. And the
miraculous confirmation needs to meet the test of uniform “success” (Deuteronomy<b>
18</b>:20-22; John <b>3</b>:34?; Acts <b>19</b>:13-17), <i>etc</i>. Succeeding
occasionally at doing something surprising does not constitute miraculous
manifestation. God does not miraculously confirm the claims of those who do not
truthfully represent him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The crux of the issue is whether someone
is supernaturally aided in a knowable and provable way—knowable to himself and
provable to other Christians. We say “knowable to himself” because a genuine
apostle has to distinguish between revelation from the Lord and wisdom of
application from himself (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>). We say “provable to others”
because other people cannot evaluate a private experience or strong sense of someone’s
certainty about something. In biblical accounts, objective authentication
associates with the ones that God specially leads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Reasons for Apostolic Claims</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Claiming apostleship may happen today for
several reasons. <b>(1) </b>Someone may be trying to avoid having to justify
his doctrinal pronouncements, authenticate his new revelations, prove his
predictions, or lend credence to his interpretations. Although he should be
satisfied with basing his message on biblical authority, he may appeal to
apostleship to avoid leaving himself open to objections from others who
understand scripture differently. Having apostolic status would eliminate
discussion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A person may want to be considered an
apostle because <b>(2) </b>he wants to claim the ability to pass on
supernatural gifts. The most relevant test is whether he is actually passing on
anything supernatural, anything relevant to Christian concerns, anything subject
to investigation. This test amounts to the definitional test, the test of
whether something bears the marks it had in the New Testament. There is no
point to “hyping” psychological phenomena into supernatural gifts or saying
that nothing happened because the recipient lacked faith or genuine
expectation; everyone is deficient in faith to some degree. Curious phenomena
like “the Toronto blessing,” “being slain in the spirit,” uttering meaningless
sounds, achieving altered states of consciousness, or displaying pointless
demonstrations, which have nothing to do with the concerns of the Christian
faith. These occurrences are more likely psychological phenomena than anything
specifically religious, much less Christian. All gifts are given for the
benefit of ministry to others (1 Corinthians<b> 12</b>:7; cp. Matthew <b>4</b>:3-4;
2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:12); so if it is something that simply gives the person
himself or someone else an “experience,” it is not “the genuine article” or it
is being misused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Perhaps, <b>(3)</b> the person wants
authority to direct affairs beyond the local church. Besides lordship and
apostleship, there is no New Testament office that is both general and
authoritative. The elders have supervisory authority, but only within the local
church. So false apostles can focus attention on apostleship. Claiming general
authority is a serious matter because, if it is true, it obligates other
Christians to obey his directives or follow anybody he appoints. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Claiming apostleship may simply <b>(4)</b>
indicate a desire for profile that enhances someone's sense of importance. Everyone
needs to understand that being called into ministry of any kind has nothing to
do with “stroking egos.” It calls not to self-enhancement, but suffering,
rejection, and worse. Ministry in any of its forms is no place for immature
people to find a basis for self-esteem through recognition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Why No Apostles Now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If the question is why there are no
apostles today, we can say we do not have to have them. We can say that <b>(1)</b>
we have <u>the same ones</u> they had in the beginning. To play on the words of
Jesus to the rich man, <i>“They have the apostles; let them read them”</i>
(Luke <b>16</b>:29). Apostleship in the New Testament is like lawgiver in the
Old Testament. Just because an office existed originally does not mean it needed
to have successors. After Moses there were judges and prophets that guided the
nation by applying the Mosaic revelation to current circumstances; and we can
imagine that God could establish a like system in our dispensation. But <b>(2)</b>
there is a difference between what would be useful and <u>what is necessary</u>.
It would be useful to have God tell us face to face where we should minister or
what business ventures to undertake to his glory so we would not waste kingdom
resources; but he is evidently not given to micromanagement.<b> (3) </b>We may <u>glorify
him</u> more by operating by his principles than by having him tell us every
move to make. We may observe as well that having court prophets did not keep
Israel on course religiously. Besides, <b>(4)</b> not having apostles or
prophets does not leave us without ongoing guidance; everything available
through manifest miracle is available through <u>answered prayer</u>. <b>(5)</b>
God's intervention in the form of <u>providence</u> is sufficient. Finally, <b>(6)</b>
in the <u>judgment</u>, God can make allowance for our good-faith mistakes in
applying apostolic principles to new circumstances outside of Bible times and
places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>A Lower View of Apostleship</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The cases above involve people who may be
“hyping” natural things into supernatural ones and associating them with
apostleship. A nearly opposite scheme reduces apostolic phenomena to something
near to normal human experience. Under this view, early Christian leaders were
not protected from error even in their doctrinal leadership. They were wise,
articulate, zealous men guided, not by propositional revelation, but by a
generally correct conceptual orientation. God supposedly reveals, not through
propositions, but through events whose meaning such men incisively interpreted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            When biblical “inspiration” becomes
comparable to intuitive creativity, it differs only in degree, not in kind,
from what modern leaders can do—a view called dynamic inspiration. This low
view of scripture brings its authors down to the level of men like Francis
Schaeffer, George MacDonald, C. S. Lewis, F. F. Bruce, Karl Barth. That
attitude toward them does not take seriously the claims of biblical writers for
themselves, including the ability to differentiate special guidance (revelation)
from personal insight (advice), as in 1 Corinthians <b>7</b>. Other texts make
explicit claims to special conceptual inspiration: Galatians <b>1</b>:11-12; 1
Peter <b>1</b>:12, <i>etc</i>. Not only have modern “apostles” not received
special propositional revelation; they have not even been witnesses of special
divine interventions such as the gospels and The Acts record and such as Peter
refers to in his second letter (<b>1</b>:15-21; cp. 2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:1-7).
There is no way to reduce these men's claims to creative intuition without
doing violence to the evident meaning of their claims.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In conclusion, we encourage people to
evaluate the lack of evidence for apostles in the technical sense as recurring
leaders present in the church, to observe the reasons against expecting such
leaders, and to test any who claim that responsibility and privilege. By all
means, we must distinguish helpful interpreters of Christian truth from those
whom Christ himself chose, specially endowed, directly sent and guided, and who
could directly serve as eyewitnesses of the cornerstone of all Christian
apologetics: the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</span></p>
