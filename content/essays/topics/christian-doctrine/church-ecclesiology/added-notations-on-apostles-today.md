<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>            </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We may
question whether Judas should be counted among the men called apostles in the
primary sense. Although he originally had that role, he left it (cp. Acts <b>1</b>:15-22)..
In addition, he did not see the resurrected Christ receive the commission and
enablements distinctive to apostles in the primary sense. With Judas omitted, that
leaves thirteen apostles with Matthias replacing Judas and Paul joining the
class later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We
might suppose that all the offices should exist today that existed in the first
century. Though the idea makes sense, it is not self-evident; and the
information we have does not bear it out. By comparison, supernatural prophets
did not exist in <u>Israel</u> at every period of its history. For the last
four hundred years of the Mosaic dispensation, God sent the nation no prophets.
That is nearly twice as long as America has been a nation! There may be less
need for prophets throughout the <u>church</u> age because the final revelation
through Christ has taken place. Besides, there is no national component now to
the people of God, a factor that previously called for court prophets to advise
the king on national affairs. We could imagine a <u>helpful</u> role for
members of the church today or as well as during those last four hundred years before
Christ, but that is not the issue. The issue is whether God decides it is
sufficiently <u>necessary</u> to fill that role. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Beyond
that, it does no good to suppose that the apostolic or prophet office should be
functioning. If no one has the marks of an apostle or prophet, insisting that
there <u>should</u> be does not change anything—as if not having a prophet indicated
a defect in someone’s dedication to God, as if it were someone’s choice to start
practicing supernatural gifts, receiving revelation, or passing on supernatural
gifts. We cannot be if we cannot do, and we can’t use what we don’t have. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Even
if supernaturally gifted persons exist in the body of Christ today, that does
not solve the question about specific cases. Each claim must be vetted. “Talk
is cheap.” Likewise, claims are easy, claims like receiving revelations that
cannot be checked, giving predictions too future to verify, offering “gifts” like
“compassion” or “knowledge” that we do not know how to identify anyway, gifts we
could not distinguish from good advice from wise Christians, forgiving someone’s
sins,<i> etc</i>. That is why Jesus provided something more tangible to verify <u>his</u>
claim to forgive sins on earth: <i>“Get up and walk”</i> (Mark <b>2</b>:9-11).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, the word <i>prophet</i> in
New Testament usage may not refer to someone <u>super</u>naturally gifted. It
may indicate an exhorter, someone good at encouraging people. In Acts <b>15</b>:32,
after recording the decision to send a letter to the Gentile churches, the text
says that Judas and Silas went along to Antioch. They, <i>“being themselves
also prophets, <u>exhorted</u> the brethren.”</i> There are people like that
today who have no supernatural gift; but they are good pulpiteers, good
speakers that can &quot;move&quot; an audience to greater service and dedicated
living. Without overdoing the comparison, we might call them “motivational
speakers.” This idea goes beyond the prophetic office as supernaturally endowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The
idea that technical apostles exist in the church today is true in an important way.
They are the same ones the church had in the first century. The situation is
comparable to “lawgiver” in the Old Testament era. At, say, 200 B. C. there <u>was</u>
a lawgiver in Israel—Moses. Likewise, there <u>are</u> apostles in the
church—the original Twelve. We have the same apostles as we have the same Lord.
As the Pentateuch became the equivalent of Moses after he died, so the New
Testament has been the equivalent of the apostles since their passing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This
question about modern apostles may involve supernaturalizing what can have a
natural basis. Taking it as a natural operation does not detract from its
excellence or from God’s involvement in the world today. The tendency to
supernaturalize represents a pendulum effect where God does not involve himself
in his creation (deism). It is a question which extreme can do more harm in the
life and ministry of the church—<u>over</u>-supernaturalizing or <u>de</u>-supernaturalizing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We
may ask whether <i>apostle</i> in Ephesians <b>4</b>:11 is a general or
technical term. Chapter III of my M. A. thesis from Wheaton College offers an
analysis of New Testament church organization [<u>The New Testament Basis for
the Non-Denominational Church: The Historical Argument</u>]. Under the entry
for “evangelist” appears the evidence for saying that apostle in the general
sense equals “evangelist.” If that evidence is satisfactory, then Ephesians <b>4</b>:11
uses <i>apostle</i> in a technical sense, because <i><u>evangelist</u></i>
appears in the same list. (See the document “The New Testament Structure of the
Church.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A
further question is how to understand “missionaries” in the modern sense. Based
on the thesis information, “missionary” equals “apostle” in the general sense,
that is, “evangelist.” The words use the same word picture—someone “sent”; <i>apostle</i>
and <i>missionary</i> derive from Greek and Latin respectively. In current
usage, “missionary” applies to cross-cultural settings and “evangelist” to
someone working in his own culture. But that refinement does not affect the <u>nature</u>
of the function. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The thesis information accords well with
the idea that <i>minister</i> in modern usage also falls under the category of
evangelist in New Testament usage. A minister holds a general office in that he
goes from place to place <u>as</u> what he is. How <u>long</u> he stays in any
one place is not the point. He may stay somewhere longer than some men are
elders there. On the other hand, because of a mobile occupation, an elder may
move more often than a minister does, but the elder does not go from place to
place <u>as</u> an elder. After serving a while in each place, he may be appointed
as an elder; but each time he is chosen from among the local constituency. Some
ministers, after staying for some time working with a given congregation, have
been installed as one of the elders. Under those conditions he becomes one
worthy of what the New Testament calls <i>“double honor,”</i> that is, he is a
paid elder. But he does not have any more supervisory authority as an <u>elder</u>
than any other elder in the congregation (though he may have more influence,
respect, natural <i>vs.</i> formal leadership, <i>etc</i>.). If he then leaves
for another congregation, he arrives at the next congregation as a minister,
not as an elder. Some have suggested the concept of “hired servant” as a
category for the minister, which is conceivable; but the evangelist
classification seems appropriate, not only for today’s evangelist and
missionary, but for minister as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Apostles
head the list in Ephesians <b>4</b>, which suggests to some interpreters that
apostles are over the others whose roles follow in the list. Apostles do have
authority over the others, but they do so as apostles in the technical, not
general here. The <u>reason</u> readers know that apostles have authority over
the rest is not that they appear ahead of the rest, but that their description elsewhere
includes leadership over the rest of the offices. [<i>Hermeneutics: Getting the
Point</i> gives the information for avoiding the over-interpretation that
occurs so often with lists; see pp. 102-4]. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpreters
argue similarly from the Ephesians <b>4 </b>list that evangelists are over the
local elders because evangelists appear ahead of them. But we cannot even tell
whether Paul had in mind an intended order, much less what that order was. It
puts too much weight on the sequence of terms to say that these offices are in
descending order of importance or authority. As far as sequence is concerned,
it is more likely that Paul puts the general offices ahead of the local ones
and the supernatural offices ahead of the natural ones. [For supporting
evidence, see again my M.A. thesis <i>The New Testament Basis for the Non-Denominational
Church</i>.] That suggestion comes, not from the order in the list, but from knowing
how those offices operated in the New Testament records.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As
for Ananais’ imposition of hands on Paul, we should remember that laying on
hands was a formal gesture used three different circumstances: (a) appointment
to an office, (b) healing someone, and (c) bestowing a miraculous gift. Besides
these usages, “lay hands on” could refer to (d) seizing someone in an attack or
a formal arrest, and (e) blessing someone. The last of these is something like
putting a hand on someone’s shoulder or on a kid’s head to express
appreciation, love, well-wishing; the gesture communicates something seriously
meant. There is no reason to think that by this gesture Ananias was appointing
Paul to the apostleship or passing on spiritual gifts to him. At most, he was
healing Paul from his blindness with this gesture. He may have put his hand on
Paul’s shoulder to make clearer contact with his blind hearer. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>“Being
filled with the Spirit”</i> in Acts <b>9</b>:17 is not clear from the immediate
context. New Testament usage does not connect <i>“being filled with the Spirit”</i>
with receiving miraculous gifts. It indicates a surge of boldness to do
something or of inspiration to speak. The text does not even say that the
filling was associated with the laying on of Ananias’ hands. When he laid his
hands on Paul, Ananias told him that the Lord had sent him so Paul might
receive sight and be filled with the Spirit. The filling could as easily
connect with finalizing Paul’s conversion, which was what Ananias did with Paul
(cp. Acts <b>2</b>:38-39). The immediate context says that at his word Paul was
baptized. Receiving the Spirit at conversion is all that needs to be happening
here. Nothing miraculous is evident, and no connection between filling and the
laying on of hands is required. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Apostle
in the primary sense involved being directly chosen <u>and</u> directly
commissioned by the Lord himself. Paul’s appointment was by Christ himself if
he was indeed an apostle in the primary sense. Acts <b>26 </b>sounds as if his
calling and appointment had occurred before Paul ever got to Damascus. Paul
says that he <i>“was not disobedient to that heavenly vision”</i> (19). In <b>26</b>:16-18,
Jesus appeared to him to appoint him a minister (direct appointment) and a
witness (of the resurrection) and of what Christ would show him later (direct
revelation). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is no word on when Paul’s gifting
began to express itself, so it is a moot point. Paul’s first recorded miracle
was striking Elymas blind on Crete during the first missionary journey (Acts <b>13</b>:8-12).
That event occurred after his three years in Arabia (Galatians <b>1</b>:17),
after a stay in Tarsus (Galatians <b>1</b>:21), after Barnabas brought him from
Tarsus to Antioch (Acts <b>9</b>:30), and after Paul had ministered in Antioch
for a while (Acts <b>13</b>:1-3). That amounts to several years after meeting
Ananias. It would be easier to argue that Paul’s miraculous gifting came from
the laying on of the hands of the Antioch elders (Acts <b>13</b>:1-3), but
there is no way to be sure that their imposition of hands was more than a
gesture of Godspeed in the work to which the Holy Spirit had called him and
Barnabas.</span></p>
