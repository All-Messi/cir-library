<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Washing feet comes up in
three New Testament texts. <b>(a)</b> Luke <b>7</b>:44 refers to it in an
episode about a sinful woman who anointed Jesus’ feet with ointment, wet them
with her tears, and wiped them with her hair (<b>7</b>:36-50). <b>(b) </b>Among
characteristics of widows enrolled in the church’s benevolence program, Paul
lists <i>“washing the saints’ feet”</i> together with parenting, showing
hospitality to strangers, and works of Christian living (1 Timothy <b>5</b>:10).
<b>(c)</b> In the upper room the night of his betrayal, Jesus washed his
disciples’ feet (John <b>13</b>:1-16). The last text has prompted some
Christians to consider feet washing an ordinance like communion and baptism—or
as a part of the communion observance. The paragraphs below analyze this view,
giving special attention to the reasoning that seems natural to the issue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The following sequence of
questions guides the interpretation of texts that mention the washing of feet: Does
the passage refer to it as (1) a <u>cultural practice</u>, (2) a <u>teaching
example</u>, or (3) a <u>Christian ordinance</u>? The options are arranged in
ascending order of strictness and therefore in the order of increasing
exactness in the evidence required. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The incident in Luke <b>7</b>
does not rise above cultural practice. The Lord is chiding his host for
criticizing the woman while the host had not even performed for Jesus such
normal amenities as giving him a kiss, washing his feet, or anointing his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Likewise, 1 Timothy <b>5</b>
does not necessarily raise the washing of feet above the level of social
custom. The text speaks of doing it to the saints but lists it in a context
about Christian living—hospitality and good works—rather than Christian
fellowship and divine worship (contrast Acts <b>2</b>:42). Such benevolence may
have included housing itinerant evangelists and entertaining other Christians
in the home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            John <b>13</b> is clearly
the text most relevant to feetwashing as a church ordinance. Here the account
raises it above a social custom to a teaching example as Jesus himself
explained. He used the custom to teach his disciples humility in leadership. The
relevance of his actions lay in two factors. <u>First</u>, servants or slaves normally
washed the feet of guests. In washing the disciples’ feet, Jesus took the role
and attitude of a slave, and demonstrated humility and willingness to serve. <u>Second</u>,
washing their feet was especially relevant because the Twelve had argued that
same night about which them would have highest rank in the kingdom, a fact not
recorded by John but known from Luke’s account of the evening (<b>22</b>:24-29;
cp. Mark <b>9</b>:34-37 = Luke <b>9</b>:46-48; Matthew <b>20</b>:20-28).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1 </span>In light of their typical Jewish
supposition that the Messianic kingdom would be a political system, the
disciples needed to see that their leadership in Jesus’ spiritual kingdom was
to be different from what they had envisioned as their future roles in a
political kingdom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(a)</b> Jesus interpreted
his own act as an <u>example</u> (<b>13</b>:15). He was not necessarily talking
about a specific act they should repeat periodically, but a behavior pattern
they were to practice. He was teaching them a way of acting rather than a
specific recurring rite. Washing their feet served as a visual demonstration
much like his using a child as an object lesson on another occasion when they
were arguing about who was of highest rank in the kingdom (Mark<b> 9</b>:34-37
= Luke <b>9</b>:46-48).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For what it is worth, we
observe that <b>(b) </b>Jesus said that the disciples were to do <i>“even<u> </u>as”</i>
he had done, not <u>what</u> he had done (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>καθώς</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, not </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ὅ</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>; </span><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype",serif'>13</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>:15b). </span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ι</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>t was not so much the act he was interested in as a
mentality the act illustrated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(c)</b> He also said that
they <u>ought</u> to do as he did. “Ought” implies moral character rather than prescribed
rite. The latter requires positive commandment to institute it whereas the
former comes from moral commandments based on the nature of the case. Jesus did
not tell his disciples to wash one another’s feet; he said they ought to do it.
He commanded baptism and communion, however (Matthew <b>28</b>:19, <i>etc</i>.,
and 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:25, <i>etc</i>.). Jesus was giving his disciples an
“example”; when he told them they ought to wash each other’s feet, he meant <i>“wash
each other’s feet, for example.”</i> If Jesus as Lord washed their feet, they
ought to wash one another’s feet; yet he as Lord had never washed their feet
before or Peter would not have reacted as he did. The Lord himself had not been
doing what he told them they ought to do in conformity with his example. They
ought to have been washing each other’s feet, so to speak, instead of arguing
about who was to hold the highest rank. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, <b>(d)</b> at
the institutions of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, the accounts describe the
ordinances as recurrent practices. In commissioning the apostles, Jesus said to
baptize those who would become disciples (Matthew <b>28</b>:19; cp. Mark <b>16</b>:16).
Of the communion cup he said, <i>“As often as you drink it, do it in my memory”</i>
(1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:25; Luke<b> 22</b>:19; cp. Matthew <b>26</b>:29; Mark <b>14</b>:25;
Luke<b> 22</b>:16, 18).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, <b>(e)</b> there is
no clear case of religious footwashing in the New Testament. By comparison,
several instances of baptism and the Lord’s Supper appear (Acts <b>2</b>:41; <b>8</b>:13,
16, 36-39; <b>9</b>:18 = <b>22</b>:16; <b>10</b>:47-48; <b>16</b>:15, 33; <b>18</b>:8;
<b>19</b>:5; 1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:13-18; and <b>2</b>:42; <b>20</b>:7; 2
Peter <b>2</b>:13?; Jude 12?), along with several explanations of their nature
and meaning (Matthew <b>28</b>:19; Mark <b>16</b>:16; Acts <b>2</b>:38; Romans <b>6</b>:3-11ff;
1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:13?; <b>15</b>:29?; Galatians<b> 3</b>:27; Ephesians <b>4</b>:5;
Colossians <b>2</b>:12; 1 Peter<b> 3</b>:21; cp. 1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:2; and
1 Corinthians<b> 10</b>:16-22ff; <b>11</b>:17-34).<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One question in 1 Timothy<b>
5</b>:9 remains: if slaves or servants washed the feet of guests, how would it
be a relevant test to ask of anyone but slaves whether a woman had washed the
feet of the saints when considering whether to enroll her as a supported widow?
Could it be that <b>(1)</b> the activity could be handled indirectly; that is,
she qualifies if she <u>provided</u> that service in her home for other
Christians under appropriate circumstances? <b>(2) </b>Was washing the feet
merely an expression for “hospitality” along with other aspects of hospitality?
<b>(3)</b> What would be the provision for footwashing in homes that had no
slaves or servants? <b>(4)</b> Is the qualification a specific requirement or a
typical indicator of Christian character? This was surely a typical,
for-example-type act, an example of “good works,” which heads the list in <b>5</b>:9
after marital considerations. Furthermore, it was surely typical because those
who did not have the means for entertaining guests would be left out of the
enrollment. They would have been the ones most likely to need assistance since those
who could entertain would not likely need support in their later years,
especially those who had servants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            None of the three texts about
feetwashing raise it above a cultural practice or teaching example. So, we
cannot show that Jesus intended it as a Christian ordinance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>_______________</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>      <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span>Whether
washing the disciples’ feet preceded or followed the dispute over rank is not
clear. Washing their feet is the first incident of the evening that John’s
account describes, but it was <i>“during supper”</i> (<b>13</b>:2). Luke
recounts the disciples’ argument after the institution of the Lord’s Supper (<b>24</b>:14-23),
which has no parallel in the fourth gospel. The announcement about betrayal
precedes the dispute in Luke (<b>22</b>:21-23) and follows the washing of feet
in John (<b>13</b>:21-30). It might seem more natural to suppose that Jesus’
demonstration was a response to the argument; otherwise, the disciples did not
see well the connection with their inclination later to argue over status. On
the other hand, having the argument later may offer a touch of realism. The
situation parallels Jesus’ prediction to Peter that he would deny Jesus three
times, and Peter did so before he realized what he was doing even though he had
been told ahead of time and he had strongly protested the very idea of doing such
a thing (Luke<b> 22</b>:33-34 + 54-62).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>      <span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span>Those
who practice feetwashing often consider it an aspect of communion, so all
references to the breaking of bread and drinking the cup can become indirect
references to feetwashing as well. While such a thing is conceivable, that
supposition does not help us <u>get to</u> the conclusion in the first place
that feetwashing is an ordinance or part of it. The issue with feetwashing—as
with all other interpretative questions—is establishing the conclusion in the
first place. It is not the alternative viewpoint’s responsibility to disprove
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is worth noting as well that Jesus
institutes the bread and cup together. The feetwashing was a separate incident
of the evening.</span></p>
