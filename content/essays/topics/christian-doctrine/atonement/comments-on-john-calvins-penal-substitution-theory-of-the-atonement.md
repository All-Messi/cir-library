style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since the Reformation, a common understanding
of Christ’s atonement work considers his righteousness as a substitute for ours
and his death as a substitute for our death as punishment for our sin. The
comments below shoulder a negative burden of proof to show that John Calvin’s penal
substitution understanding is foreign to atonement theory unless we adopt the
rest of his legal theological method, where penal substitution <u>would</u>
make sense. The thesis here is that substitutionary atonement theory does not
belong in non-Calvinistic theology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. <u>The act-guilt-penalty correlation</u>.
<u>Alienation/penalty</u> comes from <u>guilt</u>, which comes from <u>action</u>.
By the nature of the case, an action cannot be transferred from one person to
another; so the guilt it produces cannot be transferred, and the penalty for
the guilt cannot be transferred either. It does not matter whether some second
person is willing to take the penalty, whether he is sinless or not; whether he
is human, divine, or angelic; or whether he or a third party prescribed the
penalty. The simple fact that he is not the one who did the act means that he
cannot be held guilty of it or penalized for it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 What holds true negatively holds true
positively. <u>Relationship/blessing</u> corresponds to <u>righteousness</u>,
which arises from <u>action</u>. The nature of the case cannot include
transferring righteousness from one person to another because righteousness
arises from acts as surely as guiltiness does. They are both moral realities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Neither from the negative or positive
sides does substitution explain Christ’s role in our salvation. Guilt cannot be
transferred to Christ to have him take the penalty for us, nor can his
righteousness be transferred from him to us so we experience relationship to
God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. <u>The testimony of scripture</u>. More
importantly, what derives from the nature of the case is clearer from the
teaching of scripture. The Old Testament Law itself specifically forbade
punishing one person for another person’s crime: <i>“Everyone will be put to
death for his own sin”</i> (Deuteronomy <b>24</b>:16). The soul that sins is
the one that dies, not someone else (Ezekiel <b>18</b>:20). We cannot give <i>“the
fruit of our body for the sin of our soul”</i> (Micah <b>6</b>:7) any more than
the blood of bulls and goats can take away sin (Hebrews <b>10</b>:4). Even in
legal theory, divine jurisprudence forbade substitution. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 In New Testament teaching, Paul
declares in Romans <b>3</b>:21 that salvation is apart from law (</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>), which amounts to saying that it is not by legal
means. In Galatians <b>3</b>:21 he says so directly, <i>“If a law had been
given that could give life, truly righteousness would have been by [the] Law”</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3. <u>The test of consistency</u>. Christians
often reject the doctrine that Adam’s descendants are counted guilty to hell
for Adam’s sin; “guilt is personal,” they say. Yet many of them suppose that the
mechanism they deny leads to lostness is the one that leads to salvation. If
guilt can transfer from us to Christ, it can transfer from Adam to us. We
cannot deny original guilt-to-lostness for a reason we use to gain
righteousness-to-salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            4. <u>The righteous-unrighteous-Christ
paradox</u>. If real substitution were the case, Christ as substitute would be
sinful, but as to himself would be righteous for obedience even to death on a
cross. As to himself he would please the Father, but as substitute he would
utterly displease the Father. As to himself he would be God’s friend, but as
substitute he would be alienated from him. The same person would be righteous
and unrighteous, pleasing and displeasing, related and alienated at the same
time in the same sense. One person cannot view another favorably and unfavorably
at the same time in the same sense. A personal relationship cannot be and not
be at the same time in the same sense. Such things are not possible theoretically,
much less psychologically. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            5. <u>Christ did not receive our penalty</u>.
Jesus Christ did not experience the penalty God established for sin: <i>“The
wages of sin is death”</i> (Romans <b>6</b>:23). If the penalty is physical
death, Jesus did not die in our place because Christians still die. If the
penalty is spiritual death, he did not die in our place. As the penalty for
sin, spiritual death would mean permanent objective separation from God, but
Jesus did not experience permanent objective separation from the Father. At
most he experienced a temporary subjective sense of separation from him—as the Cry
of Dereliction may imply (Matthew <b>27</b>:46 = Mark <b>15</b>:34 &gt; Psalm <b>22</b>:1).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            6. <u>The continuity of kind between cause
and effect</u>. You must deal with the problem in the realm of the problem. You
cannot solve a legal problem in other than a legal way; you cannot solve a
nature problem by other than natural cause; you cannot solve a logical problem
other than metaphysically; and you cannot solve an interpersonal problem by
other than interpersonal means. The kind of cause must correspond with the kind
of result as <i>“the law of the harvest” </i>states. It is the ancient
principle of <i>“after their kind”</i> (Genesis 1:20-21, 24-25.). You cannot
gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles (Matthew <b>7</b>:16; Luke <b>6</b>:44);
you reap what you sow (Galatians <b>6</b>:7-9); what is <u>of</u> flesh <u>is</u>
flesh (John <b>3</b>:6). The result is salvation, which is reconciliation, an
interpersonal matter. Legal and interpersonal are different, parallel
categories; they are different kinds of things. Since substitution is a legal
concept, interpersonal reconciliation does not come about by the substitution
principle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 Evangelicals rightly speak of a saved
people as having a “personal relationship with God” through Christ. An
interpersonal relationship cannot come by legal means; an interpersonal result
must come by interpersonal means. Only legal results can come by legal means. Since
the result is not legal, the cause is not legal. Substitutionary atonement is a
legal concept; so it does not represent the way Christ saves us. Christ is an
interpersonal basis for reconciliation with God, or he is no basis at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            7. <u>Law as a secondary principle in
salvation history</u>. Law was a temporary add-on to interpersonal process. Grace-faith-promise
is not a secondary category inside of law-works-merit. It is the other way
around: God added law to promise for practical purposes until the realities
through Christ would come. In Galatians<b> 3</b>:15-29 Paul is quite definite
about this way of relating “law” <i>vs</i>. “grace,” “works” <i>vs</i>. “faith.”
His two terms <i>grace</i> and <i>faith</i> (<i>vs</i>. <i>law</i> and <i>works</i>)
are code words for actions on the two sides of personal relationship during
reconciliation and fellowship; that alternative to law we are calling “interpersonalism.”
If law is a secondary principle in salvation, then a legal principle like
substitution cannot bring about reconciliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                 At this point, we could add the observations
in “Bases for Interpersonalism” to show that interpersonalism is the ultimate
reality and all others are secondary: what scripture considers most original,
most central, most enduring, most ultimate; the way Christianity is defended,
its central vocabulary. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One question about the denial of
substitution theory is this: why does the Bible speak of salvation in
substitutionary terms if no substituting takes place? Scripture does speak of
Christ’s work in substitutionary language. The issue is whether such language
is reality or imagery. Non-substitutionary theory understands it as imagery,
but doing so does not deny the teaching of scripture; it denies that the
teaching of scripture means what John Calvin made of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Taking substitution language as imagery,
or analogy, is natural for the following reasons. <b>(a)</b> The discontinuous
descriptions of Christ’s atonement work require that these descriptions
represent analogy: <u>ransom</u> (Matthew <b>20</b>:28; Mark <b>10</b>:45; 1
Timothy <b>2</b>:6), <u>conqueror</u> (Hebrews <b>2</b>:14-15), <u>the brazen
serpent</u> (John <b>3</b>:14-15; <i>etc</i>.), <u>animal sacrifice</u>
(Hebrews<b> 10</b>:1-12; <i>etc</i>.), <u>purifier</u> (Hebrews <b>1</b>:3), <u>founder</u>
(Hebrews <b>2</b>:10; <i>etc</i>.), <u>example</u> (1 Peter<b> 2</b>:21-23), <u>representative</u>
(Hebrews <b>2</b>:5-18), <u>priest</u> (Hebrews <b>5-10</b>), <u>primogenitor</u>
(Colossians<b> 1</b>:13-24), <u>begetter</u> (1 Peter <b>1</b>:23), <u>purchaser</u>
(1 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:20; <b>7</b>:23; Acts <b>20</b>:28; 1 Peter <b>1</b>:18-19;
2 Peter <b>2</b>:1; Revelation <b>5</b>:9), <u>being his disciples</u> (Matthew
<b>16</b>:24-26, <i>etc</i>.). These descriptors do not form aspects of the
same whole, the same picture; at best, one could be real and the others analogous.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(b)</b> Some imageries must be
imageries because they contain elements that are foreign to what they
represent. Notably the ransom-redemption-purchase analogy implies someone to pay
the ransom to, but there is no such someone. Likewise, substitution involves
antinomies like those noted above in #4. Whenever a viewpoint creates a paradox
or whenever a view requires appealing to paradox to maintain the image, we are
dealing with an image, not a reality.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(c)</b> Christ came to save people that
were legally lost. He was born of woman, born under the Law, to redeem people
under the Law (Galatians <b>4</b>:5). There is no denial that penal
substitution can be involved in atonement; the denial is that penal
substitution is the ultimate reality in atonement. Those legally lost Christ
can be legally save by penal substitution. But that legal frame of reference is
secondary. Law—hence, legal mechanisms—cannot real-ly solve the problem because
it is real-ly an interpersonal problem: we cannot be justified by law (cp.
Hebrews <b>7</b>:19; Galatians <b>2</b>:16). Substitution imagery can appear because
it can apply in the lesser plane of legal lostness, the circumstance of a large
percentage in the original Christian community (Jews). In fact, God put the
whole Mosaic sacrificial system in place as a foreshadow of the future reality
in the Messiah (Colossians <b>2</b>:17; Hebrews <b>8</b>:5; <b>10</b>:1).   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As with all analogies, <b>(d)</b> the analogy
and the reality share crucial elements; that is the reason for the imagery. On
the negative side, both substitution and “identification” (the alternative to
substitution) involve another person that endures a painful experience because
of something we did. Jesus would not have needed to endure the painful human
predicament had we not sinned. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            On the positive side, in both substitution
and “identification,” there is a connection between our righteousness and his. By
entering the extremes of the human condition and living here without sin, he
qualified himself as the appropriate object of identification. He became
righteous by carrying out the Father’s will for him to the final degree, making
himself a most appropriate and only one for us to identify with unto
righteousness, the only one to commit to for God to considered us like him. In
both substitution and identification, there is a connection between our sin and
his suffering and between his <u>being righteous </u>and our <u>being considered
righteous</u>. Because of <u>these common elements</u>, substitution can serve
as imagery for identification even though <u>the manner of connection between
these elements</u> differs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We use analogies for affective advantage. In
this case, substitution language from the negative side causes us to feel, <i>“If
I had not sinned, he would not have had to go through all that!” </i>From the
positive side, substitution language keeps us from feeling proud that the
Father considers us righteous (Romans <b>3</b>:27; <b>4</b>:12; Ephesians <b>2</b>:9).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The three main images the New Testament uses
in atonement presentations (ransom, substitution, conquest) have an important
common element that makes them appropriate images for the salvation reality: <u>something
comes to the person in need that he did not contribute to causing in whole or
in part</u>. The decisive act of any reconciliation is done by the offended
party. That is true in substitution, it is true of conquest (Christus Victor),
and it is true of ransom/purchase/buying/ redemption. In all three images, the
result comes to the one in need by an act the other does in grace, <u>and</u>
the one in need “identifies” with the benefactor. The one in need accepts the
benefactor’s act (faith/trust in the gracious One). </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A comment about symbolism is whether
Christ’s work is merely symbolic. No. It is real. <u>Substitution</u> could be
called “symbolic” (although we prefer “substitution <u>imagery</u>,” “substitution
<u>language</u>,” or “the substitution <u>analogy</u>”). <b>But</b>, it is <u>substitution</u>
that is symbolic, not Christ’s work itself. What he did was real, and he did it
for real reasons. He lived in real history subject to the human condition,
subject to real death, violent death of a most horrible sort (Philippians<b> 2</b>:7-8).
He thereby established his real righteousness as a man in the real human realm;
in doing that, he “qualified himself” as an appropriate object that is really
righteous that we can really identify with. We identify with him unto our being
viewed as righteous by the Father. Identification means that we explicitly
commit to <u>him</u>, choosing his lordship, values, and purposes. Our
commitment to the Righteous Object of identification is God’s “condition” for
viewing us as righteous like him, righteous as his natural condition for
fellowship with himself who is righteous. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            These points characterize all personal
relationships; they are natural to personal relations <i>per se</i>. Fellowship
is always based on being <u>viewed</u> as righteous, which in theory could be
because we <u>are</u> righteous. But since “nobody's perfect,” that possibility
does not exist between us and God or between us and other people, either in
reconciliation (initial justification) or in continued fellowship. In all
social relations, it is not specifically what we really <u>are</u> or <u>do</u>
but how we are <u>viewed</u> by the other. Social relations are a practical
issue. As with most “systems,” friendships can survive a certain amount of
contrary elements. As long as the “heart,” attitude, motive override actual
behaviors (context), the friendship continues. <i>“Love covers a multitude of
sins”</i> (James <b>5</b>:20; 1 Peter<b> 4</b>:8). Repentance-forgiveness can
remove these exceptions as a barrier to association; the other person can <u>view</u>
the first as good even if not perfectly so. The offended party always
establishes appropriate “conditions” for viewing the offender as good (relative
to shared values and purposes). Those conditions amount to identification with
the offended party and commitment to him. If the second party (offended) understands
that the first one (offender) really does care about him and is committed to
him, the second party can overlook individual failures when repentance is present.
The offender may show repentance by apology, demeanor (tears?), some effort to
rectify or offer restitution where possible, by not repeating the offending
behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In reconciliation, Christ incarnate is an
extension of the other side of that relationship (the Father). In identifying
with the Son crucified, we identify with the Father; and identifying with the
Son is the Father’s condition for identification with himself for
reconciliation, fellowship, sonship, friendship, blessing, <i>etc</i>. In
keeping with the nature of friendship, God considers us righteous, not because
we are, but because we commit to one who is—and everything that implies—like
trying to live up to expectations; and that is what God asks of us, even to
taking our cross and following Jesus (Matthew 10:38; <b>16</b>:24; Mark <b>8</b>:34;
<b>10</b>:21; Luke <b>9</b>:23; <b>14</b>:27).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As a final note, our interest in
clarifying how Christ’s atonement works is for helping unbelievers make sense
of salvation. We suspect that <i>“Christ died for our sins” </i>does not explain
much to outsides—as people have admitted to me personally. Tshe claim makes
little sense as Paul says in something of a different connection, <i>“The
message about the cross is foolish to the ones that are perishing”</i> (1
Corinthians <b>1</b>:18; cp. <b>1</b>:21, 23, 25; <b>2</b>:14). <i>“He shed his
blood for our sins”</i> does not explain how shedding <u>his blood</u> has
anything to do with saving us from <u>our sin</u>. That and similar statements
in scripture are shorthand for a set of factors that connect the antecedent and
consequence. That connection should undergird thoughtful conviction. We do not
let one person go to prison for another; we do not let one person go to the
gallows for another. We need to clear up the mystery if we can.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Having said all the above, we hasten to
make clear also that these efforts do not make “theories of the atonement” a
matter of orthodoxy. If scripture feels free to use what we have called
imageries of the atonement (substitution, ransom, conquest), then certainly the
readers of scripture can regard them as practical ways of picturing what Christ
alone has done for us. We do hold back approval of a fourth idea called the
“moral influence theory,” where Jesus “saves” us by being the lone example of
human holiness and unique motivator for us to live holy lives. The goal of such
living is right and good, but we will not achieve the perfect righteous that
relationship to a holy God entails so he “owes” it to us to view us as
righteous because we are (Romans <b>4</b>:3-6). We will no more succeed at
personal perfection in the future than we have in the past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Jack Cottrell has claimed that the view of
atonement described in <i>What the Bible Says About Salvation</i> is a form of
the moral influence theory. What has caused this misreading is hard to say. Beyond
simply denying the accuracy of that reading, some clarification may help others
from misreading “Benefits of the Atonement” as presented in that book. The book
highlights three benefits of the atonement: repentance, righteousness, and
resurrection. That list represents a chronological sequence, not a logical series.
Repentance occurs before righteousness is reckoned to us in God’s mind, a
reckoning that takes place before the resurrection at the last trump. Motivation
to repent is not meant as the defining category (as in John’s baptism of
repentance) in which righteousness and resurrection then take place. Were that
so, it might be more conceivable to call the approach moral influence; Christ’s
role would be as motivator to such repentance. He would then forgive only because
of repentance and later grant resurrection to the penitent righteous. Forgiveness
would be because of repentance rather than because of the character of the
Righteous One that identification unto righteous leads to—the next step. Our
understanding, however, places Christ’s decisive role as savior in the second
step, not the first (our act). So the first response is that <b>(1) moral
influence is not so much false as insufficient, subsequent, secondary, and
aside from atonement itself.</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Cottrell’s book (<i>God the Redeemer</i>,
pp. 424-29) labels the view “The Interpersonal Theory.” While the label describes
it, it does not define it, because <b>(1)</b> the terminology does not specify
the kind of interpersonal connection between Christ’s righteousness and our
forgiveness; it does not indicate the “mechanism” in the atonement. The
specific mechanism is <u>identification/commitment-plus-reckonin</u>g. Identification-commitment
to Christ is our interpersonal commitment, and reckoning is God’s interpersonal
reckoning us righteous because of our identity with the Righteous One. If we
were to label the atonement theory as we understand it, we would prefer
“Identification Theory.” Cottrell’s statement on page 426, <i>“Repentance and
confession cleanse away all past obstacles to the forgiveness of sins,”</i> is
simply not what is meant; it leaves out the very thing Christ’s atonement is beyond
the basic repentance-forgiveness format for reconciliation. The Cottrell statement
sounds like a way to describe the typical process of reconciliation that takes
place <u>between people</u>. Perhaps God could have left the process that way for
reconciliation <u>between us and him</u>. But, that is not what he did. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Repentance has been defined as sorrow for
sin that leads to a reformation of life. So, on the repentance side of reconciliation,
the Father has called for the penitent to identify with the Incarnate Righteous
One as the specific form of expressing repentance. Now the condition for
forgiveness-unto-reconciliation is not simply repentance (as from past sin) but
repentance in pledge to reformation of life evidenced by commitment to the
Incarnate Righteous One—and all that implies about his lordship, values, and
purposes. That represents not so much an addition to the reconciliation
process, but an elaboration of repentance (by commitment to righteousness) and
forgiveness (as <u>considering</u> the penitent righteous). Christ’s incarnate
righteousness qualifies him as the appropriate object of identification by the
penitent and the One the Father considers him as being like (righteous).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Identifying-committing with-to the
Righteous One is the Father’s condition for reckoning us as righteous unto
reconciliation; that is broader than just repentance, and the added placement
of Christ in the process is the atonement factor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Cottrell criticism may stem from <b>(2)</b>
picking the wrong interpersonal mechanism—influence—instead of identification,
which is the heart of atonement through Christ. Influence is not the only
interpersonal element, so influence should not be equated with interpersonal. And,
to emphasize the depth of the identification envisioned here, we hasten to repeat
that it is more than a sense of nearness to him. Because of who Christ is,
identification in this case brings in allegiance, commitment, obedience, and
all the other factors that belong to our relationship to God through him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The criticism treated in the preceding
paragraphs may also stem from <b>(3)</b> confusing theory with fact. What might
have been possible to do in theory is not the same thing as what the Father did.
What happens between people (between equals) differs from what happens with our
Lord. For the sake of thought, we might agree that repentance-forgiveness could
theoretically be what God could call for in reconciliation and still be a just
Justifier. But what we might suppose is possible to do in theory and what God
decided to do in fact are two different things. Scripture does not lead us to
believe that what God did was <u>inherently</u> necessary. If that were so, we wonder
whether he would be sovereign; he would be subservient to more than righteous
self-consistency. Satan would have put him over a barrel; the sovereign
righteous God would be subject to something like the Fates in pagan thought. Satan
would have taken over the situation by setting up a circumstance of our
lostness by successful temptation. The New Testament indicates that within the
repentance-forgiveness format, God specified an appropriate condition for the
penitent to fulfill in expressing that repentance and trust: identify with the
Righteous One. Even if God would not theoretically have had to establish that as
an added aspect of the repentance condition, he did so and most appropriately
did so. What he <u>did</u> establish as the condition for forgiving the
penitent’s sin is what we proclaim. Inasmuch as commitment to Christ
constitutes that elaborated condition, we preach that Christ saves us by being the
object of commitment unto our imputed righteousness. We prioritize his role in
the reconciliation process, which includes understanding <u>how</u> that role
is involved—atonement theory. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We perceive appropriateness at work here more
than inherent necessity. God established an appropriate condition, which included
sending his Son to become that object of identification in the realm of physical
human existence. What God did we need not interpret as something he had to do or
had to do that way. We say that what he did was especially appropriate in
resolving an interpersonal problem between humankind and God; it did so because
of the love of God the Father and the love of the Son in leaving the realms of
glory to live in our limiting and painful-death condition susceptible to
temptation. The issue is not just what might make sense (like inherent
necessity), but what makes interpersonal “sense,” what shows how much he cares
about us (appropriateness). The incarnation unto violent death on a cross by
others adds drawing power to sheer appropriateness. If God calls us to be
faithful to the point of temptation and violent death by others, it is
appropriate that our Savior be no less in his faithfulness. That way his
disciple is not above his teacher, his servant above his master (Matthew <b>10</b>:24-25;
Luke <b>6:</b>40; John <b>13</b>:16; <b>15</b>:20). Leaders do not ask
followers to do more than they are willing to do. We take up our cross and
follow him up Calvary’s hill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, appropriateness rather than
inherent necessity may relate to how the Son could ask the Father to send
twelve legions of angels to protect him even after the Father had denied three
times his request <i>“with audible crying and tears” </i>to remove the <i>“cup”</i>
from him (Matthew <b>26</b>:53). Jesus did not call the legion of angels; if he
had, the scripture would not then be fulfilled (<b>26</b>:54). The plan had
been put in place centuries before (even before the foundation of the world)
and been prophesied as such; so carry-though had to happen for consistency’s
sake rather than for originating inherent necessity’s sake. Inherent necessity
characterizes legal process, logical process, and natural process because those
processes are deterministic; but we are dealing with a problem in the
interpersonal realm (friendship with God), so the characteristics of the
solution—summed up especially in love context—are natural to that interpersonal
process (which is not itself deterministic). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Admittedly, these last two paragraphs have
taken us into unrevealed theory, but we deem it as appropriate to speculate in
favor of appropriateness as it is to do so in favor of inherent necessity. Inherent
necessity is an unrevealed inference whose incorrectness, we believe, shows up
in its doubtful implications and in the tensions it creates in other matters
that <u>are</u> revealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is a second major problem with the
moral influence theory—depending on how it is formulated: (2) <b>moral
influence does not avoid works</b> because it does not necessarily include God’s
<u>reckoning</u> righteousness, nor does it necessarily include <u>commitment</u>
to the Righteous One as the condition for reckoning us as righteous. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>First</u>, moral influence might simply
mean that Christ’s love influences us toward holy living so we can have
fellowship with a holy God. That would omit reckoning us righteous in contrast
to our being righteous. Our righteousness in God’s eyes would rest on our own
deeds; hence, it would be a <u>person’s own</u> righteousness (Leviticus <b>18</b>:5).
It would mean actually continuing to do all—a <u>perfect</u> righteousness
(Deuteronomy<b> 27</b>:26). Short of theoretical perfection, it might feel
satisfied with basic goodness. In combination, these facts could put us back in
a legal works situation because legal works is the principle of personal
perfection (Galatians <b>3</b>:10-12). Or, it could scale back the level of
aspiration for continued spiritual growth. Since holy, righteous, and just mean
perfectly holy, righteous, and just, we could end up in at best in Galatianism:
we would begin by grace (of forgiveness) and try to continue in works (of
achievement). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Second</u>, moral influence does not
avoid works because it does not include commitment to the Righteous Other on
the other side of the relationship—or more specifically in Christianity—to the
Righteous Son who serves as an incarnate extension of the Righteous Father. Our
righteousness would be personal righteousness in response to Christ’s moral
influence rather than righteousness viewed upon us imperfect people by the
offended Other. The most crucial part the atonement is this point two in “Benefits
of the Atonement”: a reckoned righteousness based on identity with the
Righteous One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Earlier on page 425 Cottrell notes that
the proposed “theory” denies imputation, which again is true in a sense; but it
is imputation in the <u>Calvinistic</u> sense that we deny—imputation as
legally transferring <u>righteousness from Christ to us</u>, objectively
putting his righteousness in place of ours. Transferring righteousness to us is
the reverse side of transferring our guilt to him. Such a process is aside from
the sinner himself; it takes place besides him, not in his heart but in the impersonal
process, “on paper,” in the law that authorizes it. If transfer were not the
mechanism in Calvin’s penal substitution and legal imputation, there would be
no punishing Another for my guilt. Transferring act-guilt-punishment is
inherently impossible; hence, it is made to make sense only in a legal sense, only
by putting it in a legal process, which is artificial hence impersonal instead
of interpersonal. Law does not have to conform to reality to achieve its results
because the results come from authority, not reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Instead of legal imputation, we stress interpersonal
imputation in the Father’s regarding, reckoning, imputing righteousness to us as
<u>considering</u> us righteous <u>like</u> Christ <i>vs.</i> transferring <u>his</u>
righteousness <u>to</u> us and our guilt <u>to</u> him. The Father views,
reckons, regards us as being like the One we commit ourselves to. Righteousness
is imputed, not <u>from Christ to us</u> (“outside God’s mind” via legal process)
but as regarding us <u>like</u> Christ in God’s mind (by interpersonal choice).
Righteousness is imputed to us in God’s mind, not transferred from Christ to us
by authority. It is an interpersonal viewing not an objective transfer. So to
speak, again, salvation is not something that takes place “on paper” but
between persons—God and us, not on stone but in hearts, not by legal authority
but by personal choice because of love. The point is <u>how</u> God views us
and <u>why</u> he views us that way. The “why” is not that we really are righteous,
nor that someone else’s righteousness has been moved over onto us somehow—legally
or otherwise, but that we accept identity with the One who is righteous; we are
viewed as “like” that righteous One we identify with and commit to, the One we pledge
to follow to death if need be. In doing so, God’s attitude toward us is not
based decisively even on our repentant actions, but on the righteousness of the
Object of our identification. Inside the atonement framework, aspiration is the
condition for righteousness (note the flow of thought in Romans <b>7-8</b>).</span></p>

misunderstanding can come from (1) a reader unconsciously mixing in his own presuppositions

not hearing another view on its own terms. The issue points out another
difficulty: (2) the hard thing is not understanding something but keeping it
distinct from alternatives. Equivocations and cross-connections muddle the understanding.
(3) It is an example as well of trying to unpack a whole system of thought out
