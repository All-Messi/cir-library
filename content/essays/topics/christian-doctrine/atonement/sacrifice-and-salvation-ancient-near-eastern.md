<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>“Sacrifice is as old as religion, and
religion is as old as man.”</i> The <u>antiquity</u> of sacrifice relates to
its <u>universality</u>. Virtually every ancient culture offered sacrifices to
supernatural entities; some cultures still do. In the Bible, sacrifice begins
in the second generation (Genesis <b>4</b>:2-8) and appears throughout the
patriarchal and Mosaic periods, culminating in Christ’s “sacrifice.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Despite the abundance of biblical material
on sacrifice, the <u>origin</u> of sacrifice is ambiguous. Did it arise from people’s
natural religious instincts or from unrecorded divine appointment?<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1 </span>The same uncertainty applies to
the <u>rationale</u> for sacrifice; it is not explicitly stated anywhere in the
Old Testament.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> After
summarizing some particulars about sacrifice and noting some relevant
archaeological remains, the following presentation offers a rationale for
sacrifice that connects it with salvation as related to the life and death of
Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I. Kinds of Ancient Near Eastern Sacrifice</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There were three kinds of sacrifices—grain,
drink, and meat offerings. Most important among these were the meat offerings—animal
sacrifices. Altars of various sorts were erected in many places for such
offerings.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> One among many
Near Eastern altars is the first Israelite “horned” altar, discovered at
Beersheba, a stone platform five feet high and nine feet wide. A variety of
rituals attended the offering of animals on such altars. Leviticus is given
over largely to describing these observances. Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy
describe them too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The most abhorrent practice associated
with ancient sacrifice was that of <u>human sacrifice</u>. It comes up
frequently in the Old Testament,<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> but
always as something despicable.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5 </span>Among
the surrounding pagan nations, human sacrifice was common. The great high place
discovered at Gezer shows the extent to which child sacrifice was practiced. An
early description says, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“All
around the feet of the columns and over the whole area of the high place the
earth was discovered to be a regular cemetery, in which the skeletons of young
infants, never more than a week old, were deposited in jars.”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>6</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>A similar situation was unearthed at Phoenician
Carthage in North Africa. Later, L. E. Stager and S. R. Wolff argued that
population control was a primary factor in such offerings,<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>7</span> an idea that does not necessarily
refute the sacrificial interpretation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Child sacrifices were offered in times of
national calamity, for expiation of parents’ sins, and at dedicatory
observances. The most striking biblical example is found in 2 Kings<b> 3</b>:26-27,
where Mesha, king of Moab, offered his oldest son on the city wall as a burnt
offering to Chemosh in a desperate attempt to avoid military destruction by the
Israelites. Children were used as “foundation sacrifices” at the building of
homes, cities, or temples. A possible case in scripture is that of Hiel, who
rebuilt Jericho <i>“with the loss of Abiram his firstborn and set up its gates
with the loss of his youngest son Segub”</i> (1 Kings <b>16</b>:34; cp. Joshua<b>
7</b>:26).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The closest thing to human sacrifice in
Old Testament religion is Abraham’s subjective offering of Isaac (Genesis <b>22</b>:1-19;
cp. Hebrews <b>11</b>:17-19). The father of the faithful was therefore no less
devoted to Yahveh than anyone else would be to his god.  One reason for telling
Abraham to offer Isaac and then preventing him from carrying it out may have
been to show clearly that Yahveh did not really want human sacrifice;<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>8</span> he wanted the willingness of his
faithful ones to prioritize him in everything. In Mosaism the redemption of the
firstborn (Exodus <b>13</b>:1-2, 11-16; Luke <b>2</b>:23) replaced the
sacrifice of the firstborn. In a perverted way, the offering of one’s own child
would be the most extreme sacrifice he could make, but God did not want that. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. Purpose and Meaning of Ancient Sacrifice</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In pagan worship, sacrifices were
sometimes regarded as <b>(a)</b> <u>food</u> for the gods.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>9 </span>Paul may have had this idea
partly in mind when he told the Areopagites that God surely is not served by
men’s hands <i>“as though he needed something”</i> (Acts <b>17</b>:25). Although
the Bible ridicules the idea (Deuteronomy <b>32</b>:37-38; Psalm <b>50</b>:12-14),
some scholars see a correlation in Yahwism in expressions like <i>“the food</i>
[lehem] <i>of God”</i><span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>10 </span>and <i>“smelling
the sweet savor”</i> of sacrifices<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>11</span> and
in epiphanies like the one to Gideon in Judges <b>6</b>:19-24. The sacrifice
categories were all food categories, but the feeding reason for edible
sacrifice depends on the view of the deity, a low one as Paul implied on Mars
Hill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            More appropriately, a sacrifice was a <b>(b)
</b><u>gift</u> to the deity. The worshiper could give it simply to <u>honor</u>
God, but often it was additionally motivated by a desire for some <u>benefit</u>.
To the <i>honor</i> <i>category</i> belong sacrifices like those Solomon
offered at the dedication of the temple, as well as <u>thank</u> offerings for
benefits already received.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>12</span> There
were <u>peace</u> offerings, which included wave offerings and heave offerings.
To the <i>benefit category</i> belong sacrifices designed to obtain a special
favor like victory in battle (Saul in 1 Samuel <b>15</b>) or to <u>appease</u>
the anger of the deity. Since Yahveh, however, was a God of principle, not just
a God of power, sacrifices were for more than propitiating God’s anger; they were
also for expiating people’s <u>sin</u>. Human behavior is not just a matter of “rubbing
God the wrong way”; it is sin. So, sacrificial categories included sin and
guilt offerings. Other benefit sacrifices were <u>purification</u> offerings
and sacrifices that accompanied the <u>consecration</u> of people and things. Some
have suggested that all sacrifices were for getting something (<i>do ut des</i>),
but that taints a worshiper’s motives. Sacrificing meant acknowledging God in
all aspects of human experience. Giving in order to <u>praise</u> needs to be
kept primary in normative Old Testament sacrifice at least.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One important generalization in our study
is that <u>sacrifices were offerings as an extension of the self</u>, an
extension of the worshiper’s identity. (1) In the Old Testament a sacrifice had
to be taken from one’s own flock (Leviticus <b>1</b>:2); hence, it could not be
a wild animal or a domestic animal from someone else’s flock. After the plague
on Israel because of David’s sin, when Araunah the Jebusite offered to give him
the oxen, the yokes, and the threshing floor itself (2 Samuel <b>24</b>:18-25),
David replied, <i>“I will not offer burnt offerings to Yahveh my God that do
not cost me anything”</i> (<b>24</b>:24). In the case of human sacrifice, it
was the offering of one’s own child (or slave or attendant) that was thought to
be efficacious. Sacrifices had to be one’s own possessions, produce, or
progeny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (2) Placing hands on the head of the
animal identified people with their sacrifices as well as symbolically transferring
their sins to it. The worshiper did that with the scapegoat (Leviticus <b>15</b>:21)
but with the burnt offerings as well.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>13</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) In Mosaism, to be acceptable,
sacrifices had to reflect the character and inner disposition of the offerer.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>14</span> God rejected Cain’s sacrifice
because it was not “of faith” (Hebrews <b>11</b>:4). Whereas pagans might think
they could offer sacrifices effectively without heartfelt devotion to the
deity, that was not possible with the heart-knowing God Yahveh. A sacrifice was
not inherently effective; the ritual itself did not obtain the benefit (Psalm <b>40</b>:6-8a
&lt; Hebrews<b> 10</b>:1-12). Offerers had to mean it; that is, they had to
identify with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (4) Identification is also implied by the
requirement that the sacrifice had to be without blemish. It could not be
something that the offerer did not want or would get rid of anyway—a sick or deformed
animal (Leviticus<b> 22</b>:17-25). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (5) Identification with the sacrifice is
shown in the metaphorical use of sacrificial language. Such phraseology appears
in Old Testament texts like Psalm <b>1</b>:13-14; <b>51</b>:16-17; and Isaiah <b>66</b>:20.
It is particularly prominent in the New Testament. Christians are to be living
sacrifices (Romans <b>12</b>:1; cp. <b>6</b>:13, 16, 19; 1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:20),
people who offer spiritual sacrifices (1 Peter <b>2</b>:5), sacrifices that
praise (Hebrews<b> 13</b>:15). The Gentiles were an acceptable offering to God
(Romans <b>15</b>:16). At the end of his life, Paul told Timothy, <i>“I am
already being poured out as a liquid offering, and the time for my departure
has arrived”</i> (2 Timothy <b>4</b>:6; cp. Philippians <b>2</b>:17?).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The distinctives of Hebrew sacrifice are
important because they relate to meaning. (1) The first distinctive of Mosaic
sacrifices was their connection with sin. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“The
sin offering was a sacrifice of a special kind, doubtless peculiar to Israel
and first mentioned at the consecration of Aaron and his sons.”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>15 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“.
. . ancient polytheists had no sense of sin comparable to that found in the Old
Testament. Sin in Mesopotamia was such that it could be dealt with by the
priest (‘asipu), who pronounced an incantation. Sin and impurity were conceived
of in a physical way and were dealt with by rites of expulsion . . . .”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>16 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the biblical religion, God’s character sets the
meaning of sacrifice and therefore the meaning of Christ’s “sacrifice.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (2) The second distinctive of Hebrew
sacrifice was its emphasis on the blood.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>17</span> That uniqueness evidently relates to picturing life as
being in the blood<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>18</span> rather
than in some vital organ like the brain, which connects then with prohibitions
against eating blood.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>19</span> The
shedding of blood means dying an unnatural death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>               The New Testament presents Christ’s
atonement in some fifteen or twenty images. Most prominent among them is
sacrificial language. In keeping with the preceding two peculiarities of Mosaic
sacrifice, Jesus Christ did not die from disease or old age; he shed his blood.
He did not just die; he was killed. Second, since his whole incarnation was for
saving people from alienation because of sin, his death was part—the
culminating part—of his effort to lay a foundation for dealing with our sin in
the physical realm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>              Beyond the meanings of ancient Near
Eastern sacrifices generally and unlike the preceding sacrificial shadows and
types in ancient Israel, Christianity calls for <u>self-sacrifice</u>. It calls
for the real thing, the only real thing that can meet the natural requirements
of the case. As the <i>“Lamb of God”</i> without moral blemish, he submitted
himself to the will of the Father to the point of self-sacrifice. No longer can
people substitute something else for themselves. They cannot substitute the
sacrifice of a possession for the sacrifice of the self. That is one
implication of Paul’s comment that we are <i>“bought with a price”</i> (1
Corinthians <b>6</b>:20; cp.<b> 7</b>:23; Acts <b>20</b>:28; 1 Peter <b>1</b>:18-19;
Revelation <b>5</b>:9). Not “owning” ourselves means we have forfeited
autonomy; we have committed ourselves to the predominance of God over self,
prioritizing his will over ours. It is not satisfactory—and never has been—to
sacrifice something we identify with or sacrifice part of our “extended
identity”; we must sacrifice our own identities. We cannot identify “indirectly”
with God by giving him something else that we identify with. We must identify
directly with him by giving up the autonomy of self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Among several other things, when we make
commitment to Christ, we say with him, <i>“Not my will but yours be done”</i>
(Matthew <b>26</b>:39, 42; and synoptic parallels). The Father’s will for Jesus
was to obey to the point of violent death on a cross (cp. Philippians <b>2</b>:1-11).
When we identify with Jesus, not only does God offer to view us as righteous <i><u>like</u></i>
him who carried his obedience to the last measure of devotion in painful physical
death—the <u>benefit</u> aspect of sacrifice; we must first give the <u>honor</u>
aspect of sacrifice. We commit ourselves to Christ’s lordship, values, and
purposes, to doing the <i><u>same</u></i> thing Christ did if God wills. When
we identify with Christ, we offer self-sacrifice. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is a serious thing to become a
Christian. We must sacrifice our very self.</span></p>

to evaluate some forty small altars dating from the tenth to seventh centuries
B.C. They measure from six to twenty-six inches high and less than a cubit
square. Although they were previously considered incense altars, the author
contends that they were for grain offerings because few of them have any
indications of burning.</span></p>

difficult to accept, however, as a case of human sacrifice because it seems

recounts the testing of Abraham’s complete trust in Yahveh. It was first a test
of the degree of his devotion in which he showed himself as committed to God as
any pagan would be in offering his firstborn son. Second, since Isaac was his
only son, giving him up meant giving up Abraham’s own lineage, a supreme “sacrifice”
in a culture that stressed having descendants; spiritual sons of faith would
replace physical sons. Third, Abraham had to exercise extreme faith in the form
of sanctified imagination to harmonize God’s promise of a lineage through Isaac
with his command to sacrifice Isaac. These seemingly inconsistent things
Abraham supposed would be made compatible by resurrecting Isaac afterwards
(Hebrews<b> 11</b>:17-19; in Genesis <b>22</b>:5, before the sacrifice Abraham
told his young men, <i>“<u>We</u> will return to you.”</i>).</span></p>
