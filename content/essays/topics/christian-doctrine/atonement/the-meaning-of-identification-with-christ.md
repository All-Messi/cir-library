<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>“Identification with Christ”</i> refers
to a complex of factors within the reality of personal relationship, which we are
calling interpersonalism. Interpersonalism is a worldview that considers
persons in relationship as the highest frame of reference. That reality
includes aspects like the following.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b><u>Faith</u></b><u> in Christ as the
object of identification in place of all others</u>. We not only understand and
believe intellectually, but trust actively that Christ is an “extension of,”
and the human “manifestation of,” the other side of the divine-human
relationship. We believe that identification with him leads to identification
with the Father because that is the Father’s condition for identification with
himself. We believe what Christ believes; we accept what he teaches about all
things whereof he speaks. We put our trust in him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Commitment by the whole person to
Christ</u>. Identification not only deals with overt behavior (outer action)
but with feelings, thoughts, aspirations, motives, and attitudes (inner
action). It gives a sense of identity, who we are, nearness, friendship, worth,
thinking about, desire to spend time with, receiving and giving help, enjoying
each other’s company, and the like—the same things that are true between human
friends. They deal with more than dealing with sin; they deal with what we have
together when sin does not get in the way or ruin things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>A sense of oneness with Christ</u> to
the exclusion of all others (EXCLUSIVE). We are <u>Christ</u>ians and wear his
name; in so doing, we embody to other people a living <b>confession</b> of who
we are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Commitment to Christ’s lordship</u>. That
personal relationship is not between equals. So, identification means
commitment to his <u>values</u>, which implies <b>repentance</b> from previous
values and acts done in keeping with those other frames of reference. The
commitment deals with moral behavior. Commitment to his lordship likewise means
commitment to his <u>purposes</u>, which implies repentance from previous
purposes and other purposes. It includes participation in his work, which deals
with service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Commitment to the <i>degree</i> (TOTAL)
and <i>length</i> (PERMANENT) of Christ’s obedience to the Father</u>. His was
obedient to death and until death. With Job we say, in effect, <i>“Though he
slay me, yet I will trust in him”</i> (Job <b>13</b>:15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Continued involvement with him</u>. People
we identify with we want to be around and do things with, for, and like. So it
is when we identify with Christ. We want to be part of him and “take part” with
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Doing our goodness toward Christ</u>. <b>First</b>,
Christian goodness means more than conforming behaviors to a standard of
morality and duty. It means directing our actions toward a Person in love and
service. These values and purposes are personalized in that they lie in him as
a person, not in ideas period, in a standard of behavior, in words or in a
book. Christian goodness is not just goodness, but goodness that honors
him—being good with him in mind. <b>Second</b>, it means doing toward him
rather than someone else. <b>Third</b>, it means doing our goodness <u>as to
Christ</u> even when our actions are not done directly to him, that is, when
the actions are other than acts of worship and service. It embodies the reality
Jesus describes in Matthew <b>25</b>:31-46: <i>“Inasmuch as you have done it to
the least of these brothers of mine, you have done it to me”</i> (cp. Hebrews <b>6</b>:10;
Proverbs <b>19</b>:7; contrast <b>14</b>:31). Identification means doing our
goodness <u>in the name</u> <u>of</u> Christ (Matthew <b>10</b>:40-42; cp. Mark
<b>9</b>:41). It means doing our acts to him more than to human persons
(Colossians <b>3</b>:23-24; Ephesians <b>6</b>:5-6; <b>5</b>:22?).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Identity with Christ means <u>interpersonal
relationship</u> with Christ and acknowledges his <u>lordship</u> over us. Identification
involves our <u>sense</u> of identity that corresponds to appropriate <u>knowledge</u>,
<u>actions,</u> <u>feelings</u>, and <u>motives</u>, that is, with who we are,
what we believe, how we feel, what we do, and why we do it. It incorporates the
change from alternatives implied by these things. Identification summarizes
faith, repentance, and confession, and extends to their formal expression in <b>baptism</b>
and <b>communion</b>, which correspond respectively with initial and continued
identity with Christ (unto identity with God).</span></p>
