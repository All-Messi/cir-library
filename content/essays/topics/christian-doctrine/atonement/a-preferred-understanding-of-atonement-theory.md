<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our understanding
of atonement may sound unique and raise practical questions we need to take
responsibility for. <u>First</u>, identification theory can be unsettling
because it implicitly denies what for many is a settled issue: Christ saves us
by being our negative and positive substitute, negatively by enduring the
consequences of our guilt in place of us and positively by becoming our
righteousness in our place. They may not identify this concept as John Calvin’s
atonement theory, which he gave its classical expression only during the
Reformation. Christian Churches, Churches of Christ, and Disciples of Christ
may not stop to consider the implications of the fact that their movement has
set aside Calvin’s other distinctive doctrines. Knowing no alternative to his
theory, they may assume that any alternative to it is a doctrinal departure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Second</u>, as
with any new idea, people can misunderstand identification theory because they
have difficulty hearing it on its own terms. They can unconsciously mix it with
elements of their own understanding and produce artificial, hybrid ideas and
make irrelevant inferences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Third</u>, since
we may have no predecessors to pave the way, standard terminology, reasoning
patterns, and presentation formats do not already exist for communicating
clearly and efficiently. We must assume responsibility for any confusion in the
body of Christ that this atonement concept could bring. It does none of us any
good to be wrong and to mislead people with our mistakes. Nevertheless, correct
understanding must be the concern because a more satisfying explanation of
Christ’s work can lead to more effective outreach to unbelievers and greater
confidence among the faithful. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We all believe that
<b>(1)</b> salvation means being brought back into personal relationship with
God (<u>reconciliation</u>). In this respect, 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:17-21
stands out by using <u>reconciliation</u> repeatedly to describe the nature and
purpose of Christian mission: <i>“ . . . in Christ God was reconciling the
world to himself . . . having given us the ministry of reconciliation”</i> (<b>5</b>:19).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We all confess that
<b>(2) </b><u>Jesus Christ is the only savior</u>, the only One in terms of
whom God figures the salvation of any person that is saved in any dispensation
or circumstance. We put the point this way because Jesus Christ is more than
savior of those who lived after him. Hebrews <b>9</b>:15 says that God figures the
salvation of all Jewish saints in terms of Christ: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“He is the mediator of a new
covenant that, a death having taken place for the redemption of the
transgressions under the first covenant, they who have been called may receive
the promise of the eternal inheritance.”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1 Peter <b>3</b>:19-<b>4</b>:6
speaks similarly about saved people from the patriarchal age: <i>“ . . . the
gospel was preached even to the dead that they might be judged indeed according
to people in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.” </i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We all believe that
<b>(3) </b><u>sin is what separates</u> us from God, that <u>we have all sinned</u>
and are all thereby separated from him, and that <u>not everyone will be saved</u>.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>In Isaiah <b>59</b>:2<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>God declares, <i>“Your sins have
separated you from me.”</i> Romans <b>3</b>:23 serves as a familiar reference
for the conclusion that <i>“all have sinned and fall short of God’s glory.”</i>
Matthew <b>25</b>:46 joins many texts in saying, <i>“These will go away into
eternal punishment, but the righteous </i>will go away<i> into eternal life.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We all know that <b>(4)</b>
<u>we cannot save ourselves</u>, but that <u>God saves us on the basis of our
identity with Jesus Christ</u> (Ephesians <b>2</b>:4-10, <i>etc</i>.).<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'> </span>In addition to the Great
Commission itself, a host of statements about Christian baptism express the
idea that in it we identity with Christ: <i>“As many of you as have been
baptized <u>into</u> Christ have put on Christ” </i>(Galatians<b> 3</b>:27). <u>In</u>
Christ we receive grace and glory (Ephesians<b> 1</b>:3-14, <i>etc</i>.) and
have fellowship with the Father (1 John<b> 1</b>:3).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Furthermore, we
agree that <b>(5) </b>as a matter of practical appropriateness, God identified
with mankind through incarnation in the person of the Son, who carried his
obedience to the Father to the point of shedding his blood in violent death on a
cross, thereby establishing his own obedience to the same degree that he calls
on his own disciples to do for him as their savior <a name="_Hlk191985640">(Matthew<b>
10</b>:38; <b>16</b>:24; Mark <b>8</b>:34; <b>10</b>:31; Luke [<b>8</b>:23];<b>
14</b>:27)</a>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(6)</b> Identification
with Christ Jesus means deliberate, total, permanent, exclusive commitment to
him in contrast to all parallel possibilities. It means commitment to carry our
righteousness to the same level as he carried his out in our physical arena. It
means commitment to him as a person, to his values for our life, to his purpose
for our future, to his leadership and lordship in everything. It means our
sense of being on his side as well as our sense of who we are. We agree on the
facts up through this point.</span></p>

Distinctive Issue in Identification Theory</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The difference in
our view comes in the next step. What is <u>the manner in which Christ saves us</u>?
What does identification with Christ give us access to? Does it give us access
to an interpersonal act (forgiveness as in <u>identification theory</u>), a
legal mechanism (penal substitution as in <u>John Calvin’s atonement theory</u>),
a supernatural power (conquest of Satan, sin, and death as in <u>Christus
Victor theory</u>), or a <u>ransom</u> of one person by another? Penal
substitution, conquest imagery, and ransom language are three prominent ways of
picturing the reality. To these we may add <u>purchase imagery</u> as perhaps a
broader image than ransom (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:20;<b> 7</b>:23; Ephesians <b>1</b>:7,
14; Colossians <b>1</b>:14; Hebrews <b>9</b>:12, 15; 2 Peter<b> 2</b>:1;
Revelation <b>5</b>:9; <b>14</b>:3-4<b>)  These viewpoints have an important,
true element in them: a result that comes from someone else to people in need
who cannot do anything about it on their own and do not contribute to producing
the result when it comes. </b>But those are not complete pictures of the
reality; they are different pictures scripture offers, and they do not comprise
parts of a common whole.              </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Identification
theory strikes at the full reality of what Christ’s atonement means. It calls
for personally identifying with Christ as God’s condition for viewing us as
righteous like him and for giving us everything that implies and derives from
it. Because of our identity with him who <u>is</u> righteous, God is willing to
<u>view</u> us as righteous like him (forgiveness), regard us as in fellowship
with him (gift of the Holy Spirit), and add us to the body of Christ (church
membership). Salvation is a choice in God’s mind. The death that we are in
(alienation) and would continue to be in (hell) is replaced by reconciliation,
a reconciliation based on being viewed <u>as</u> righteous, not because we are
but because we have identified with, and committed to, him who <u>is</u>
righteous. The correctness and adequacy of this last step is the point at issue
and no other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In other words, the
issue lies in “the theory of the atonement.” Any concern over the theory
offered here implies one of two things: <b>(1)</b> this final step contradicts
one or more of the previous confessions or cannot provide for their basis; <b>(2)
</b>this final step cannot account for actual statements of scripture. On the
first point, we have not seen any such implication. On the second, we have not
found any texts that are incompatible with identification theory. In fact, our
search for an alternative to John Calvin’s popular penal substitution theory arose
because of texts that do not fit with substitution language taken as straightforward
explanation. So we move to some objections that attempt to make one of those
two points.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If identification is the
foundation for salvation, would identification with Moses, David, Paul, or
Peter also work? Would Jesus have needed to become a man at all?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Identification
with some human person would certainly <u>not</u> work. It would have nothing
to do with what we mean by identification; it would have nothing to do with
gaining righteousness because all people have sinned (Romans<b> 3</b>:23). Righteousness
means perfect righteousness, not just predominant goodness. Identification unto
being viewed as righteous appropriately calls for identification with the
Righteous One unto God’s viewing us as like him. The object of identification
needs to be sinless, and it is most suitable that the object of identification
become sinless in the arena of the ones he became the basis for saving (Hebrews
<b>5</b>:8-<u>9</u>; <b>2</b>:14-18): human on earth, the physical realm. Consequently,
God sent his Son as a man to earth to establish his righteousness on earth even
to the point of agonizing death, and then he called for us to commit to him—as his
condition for viewing us as righteous –like him—with the result of reconciling
us to himself. The righteousness of the Son is in regard to the same values and
purposes the Son has; he is an extension of the Father. So identifying with the
Son amounts to identifying with the Father who sent him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christ’s becoming a
man (incarnation) made it possible to establish the only case of human sinlessness
in voluntarily <i>“laying down his life for his friends” </i>(John <b>15</b>:13),
yes, even his enemies (Romans<b> 5</b>:8-11). He became the only one the Father
could appoint for us to identify with in the—as a basis for <u>being viewed as
righteous</u>—like him—in place of our own <u>being righteous</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Besides, this is
not a “light” kind of identification where we feel a sense of closeness to or
appreciation for. Because Christ is also appointed as Lord, identification with
him includes commitment to him as a person and to his values and purposes.
Commitment to him as “container” of righteous is an aspiration the Father is
willing to accept in place of our achievement, a good-faith indication of where
our heart is. God <u>views us</u> as like the one we commit to. It is not a
matter of somehow transferring our guilt to him or transferring the penalty for
our guilt to him; neither is it a transfer of his righteous to us and the
blessings of his righteousness. Our being considered righteous is a personal
choice in the mind of the Father, something that he does, not something that
happens in the operation of a law external to him. Objectively transferring a
positive or negative moral quality is inherently impossible as well as
scripturally forbidden (Ezekiel <b>18</b>:20).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Those factors and
others come together to show that identifying with some other person does not
represent what atonement through Christ involves. Whatever may be thought about
whether Christ <u>had</u> to become a man, <b>(a) </b>that is in fact the way
the Father decided to set up the “system,” the “plan of salvation.” <u>Inherent
necessity</u> of doing it the way he did it, is a theoretical idea no one needs
to prove. Nevertheless, we can use sanctification imagination like Abraham did at
the sacrifice of Isaac to offer some comments about <b>(b)</b> <u>practical
need</u> for doing it the way he decided. The ones Christ came to save are
physical people that God calls on to endure ultimate righteous even if
agonizing death becomes the case—as tradition says about Peter’s being
crucified upside down. If God calls on his people to obey him to that degree, <b>(c)</b>
it is <u>appropriate</u> to call on their Savior to endure as much as the saved
are called on to endure. <b>(d)</b> Christ’s suffering <u>eliminates accusing</u>
God of unfairness because he supposedly does not realize what it is like to
live like us in the physical condition and its limitation, suffering, and
death. <b>(e)</b> Christ’s enduring what he did in the flesh serves to show
God’s love for us in a way like no other.  See also comments in “Strictures on
Penal Substitutionary Atonement Theory,” III, E.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B. Hebrews <b>9</b>:22
says that <i>“without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.”</i>
Does not Christ’s death, then, appear to be specifically what establishes the
foundation for forgiveness and to establish that foundation on the principles
that underlie animal sacrifice? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>              <u>First</u>, the
text says, <i>“<u>According to law/[the Law</u>] there is no remission of sins
without the shedding of blood.”</i> Salvation is granted, however, on the basis
of primary realities, principles operating prior to the giving of the Law
(Galatians <b>3</b>:15-22). Law was a <u>secondary</u> element <u>temporarily</u>
added to the pre-existing reality by which God reckoned Abraham righteous and
promised him a seed like himself. That reality is interpersonal, for which “faith,”
“grace,” “promise” are Paul’s code words (cp. Romans <b>4</b>). Thus, Abraham
is regarded as the father of the faithful (Galatians <b>3</b>:3-29), the
prototype of all who relate to God by faith rather than personal perfection
(Romans <b>3-4</b>; <b>11</b>:1-25; <i>etc</i>.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Second</b>, grace-faith
does not take place inside law as if legal process were the primary category
whose mechanisms provide the reconciliation to God. Law was a secondary overlay
that did not come in till the time of Moses. Even then it was added to enhance
readiness for the real thing in Christ. The gospel marks a return to the
realities already in place 430 years before the Law (Galatians <b>3</b>:17),
principles operative from the beginning. In respect to divine-human
relationship, law did not exist. Even during the time of the Law, it was not
the Law that provided the real basis for salvation (Galatians <b>3</b>:11-12
&lt; Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:26; Habakkuk<b> 2</b>:4; Leviticus<b> 18</b>:5).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Third</b>, the
original question above was, <i>“Does not Christ’s death, then, appear to be
specifically what establishes the foundation for forgiveness and to establish
that foundation on the principles that underlie animal sacrifice?” </i>The
assumption in the question lies in the word “specifically.” “<u>Without</u> the
shedding of blood” does not mean “<u>only</u> the shedding of blood.” In place
of “specifically” should be “the last and highest” expression of his human
righteousness; it is the epitome that culminates all his previous righteous
life. His whole righteous life is in view, not just the blood-shedding final act.
Christ’s whole life, including his death, becomes the basis for atonement
because his whole life participated in establishing his human righteousness on
earth that he took to the cross. His death is the epitomizing basis rather than
the discrete basis for atonement; it epitomizes rather than exhausts the Father’s
will for him. So to speak, we need look no further than his death to see the
kind of man he was all along. It was the Father’s will for him that serves as
the standard for measuring the Son’s righteousness, and his righteousness is
the quality in him that, among other things, we identify with when we identify
with him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That includes the
good things he did earlier in other kinds of situations confrontational or not.
He demonstrated his righteousness not only in dealing with rejection by the
religious authorities and others, but also in his compassion for the people he
healed and fed and defended against criticism, his corrective teaching on some
excesses in the tradition of the elders as well as in popular notions that
needed remedy. His establishing a foundation for our salvation was not just the
one, most outstanding act by itself, but the whole life of which the last act
stood out above the rest and was the culmination of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Fourth</b>,<b> </b>the
question needs adjusting. <i>“Christ’s death specifically . . .  establishes
that foundation on the principles that underlie animal sacrifice?”</i> As expressed
in this wording, the question is at least unclear if not erroneous. We stress the
fact that animal sacrifices did not establish the basis for understanding the
meaning and mechanism in Christ’s death. His death established the reason the previous
sacrifices were instituted, not how they pictured effectiveness. They were
analogous to Christ’s death, not of the same as his death. They were a picture
of the <u>fact</u> that he would die, not a definition of the <u>meaning</u> of
his death. The sacrifices could be viewed as substituting for the worshiper’s
punishment or death, but that was not a real substitution but a legal
transaction. <i>“The blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sin.” </i>To put
it differently, that animal sacrifices were legally substitutionary does not
mean Christ’s death was legally substitutionary. The common element is death by
shedding blood, not necessarily the meaning of the blood-shedding death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Second</u>, the
comments above about Hebrews <b>9</b>:22 show that even in terms of secondary legal
backgrounds, Christ qualified himself to serve as Savior, born of woman and
born under the Law (Galatians <b>4</b>:4). <i>“Without the shedding of blood
there is no remission,”</i> however, is a statement that applies also to the
interpersonal framework wherein lies identification with Christ unto
reconciliation. In our physical human realm, Christ carried out his obedience
to the Father to the ultimate level: agonizing death on a cross where he shed
his blood. So there <u>is</u> “remission of sins” through him <u>with</u> “the
shedding of blood” because by that obedience he achieved the highest possible
level of righteousness and became the only appropriate object of identification
appointed by the Father.</span></p>

something someone could say to harmonize John Calvin’s substitution theory with

application, because he presses the point that the Law chronologically followed
the time of Abraham’s justification and God’s promise to give him a seed by
promise. The primary reality (interpersonal relationship) cannot be based on a
secondary system (legal process). The very nature of antecedent and consequence

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This presentation
on atonement theory comes in a context where penal substitution theory is the main
alternative view. Our proposal considers sacrificial, substitution language
either (a) in reference to salvation for Jews in the lesser plane of law or (b)
as a picture more than a reality. Naturally, then, objections to that view
center around taking such language as a picture. What justifies making this
shift? Is penal substitution too frequent to be “just a picture”?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Several responses
appear above and elsewhere.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>3</span> We
repeat here the observation that <b>(1) </b>substitution is but one among as
many as twenty images for describing Christ’s work or aspects of it, depending
on how we count them: ransom/buyer/redeemer, the brazen serpent, healer,
“whipping boy” (Isaiah <b>53</b>:5), animal sacrifice, purifier,
founder/pioneer, conqueror, propitiation, example, representative, prophet,
priest, primogenitor, testator (Hebrews<b> 9</b>:16), sire (1 Peter<b> 1</b>:23),
protector (John<b> 10</b>:11). Since they are discontinuous and mutually
exclusive descriptions, several of them <u>have</u> to be pictures; so
substitution may be a picture too because scripture freely uses pictures in
treating this subject. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(2)</b> The
frequency of substitution language does not determine whether it is a reality
or a picture. Number (frequency) and nature (picture<i> vs</i>. reality) are
different kinds of things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>(3)</b>
Understanding substitution as a picture does not make it meaningless. Calling
it “just” a picture would depreciate the positive reasons for using that picture.
Writers use pictures (a) to communicate more than little or nothing, (b) to
establish a point of contact with an audience, (c) to stress the affective
dimension more effectively, and (d) to make the point more memorable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            By “communicating
more than nothing” we mean that subjects are often difficult to understand
because they are complex, because they deal with intangible matters or address
facts not fully knowable by experience. In such cases, it is better to use a picture
than to communicate nothing. A picture can communicate at least something real
about the subject. Jesus’ parables have this value and so do atonement images. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Establishing a
point of contact” by a picture makes topics more interesting by making them feel
more relevant. When hearers can identify with the <u>picture</u>, they can
thereby be led to some appreciation for the <u>message</u>. In this case,
sacrifice was a familiar concept that shared significant elements with the
reality it pictured.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>4</span> Using
sacrifice in that Near Eastern setting was similar to Don Richardson’s using
the “peace child” image to gain a foothold for the gospel among the Sawi people
of Netherlands New Guinea.<span style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>5 </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Making information
more memorable” comes from providing a “reality” through the picture. Sacrifice
adds the visual element to greater interest and stronger relevance in order to
make Christ’s love unforgettable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Most importantly, <b>(4)
</b>considering substitution as an image removes contradictions with other,
clear teachings of scripture. Taking something as a picture is a form of
figurative interpretation, but the motive for figurative interpretation is to
harmonize, not to evade. Figurative interpretation is a justified inference
based on inerrancy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            To illustrate the
principle in the fourth observation, we offer an analysis of a comparable case
found in Hebrews <b>12</b>:5-13. The writer tells his readers not to forget the
exhortation of Proverbs <b>3</b>:11-12: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“My son, do not regard
lightly the disciplining by the Lord or give up when you are reproved by him;
because the Lord disciplines the ones he loves and whips every son he receives.”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this way the Hebrew writer
puts a positive reconstruction on a negative experience. The readers’
sufferings became an opportunity for growth they could not otherwise have
experienced. <b>(a)</b> They were to infer from suffering that God loves them
even as a son is to infer from his father’s spankings that Dad cares enough
about him to confront him, to take the time to correct him, to do something he
does not enjoy needing to do, and to do so at the risk of losing favor with him
(<b>12</b>:7). <b>(b)</b> Every son receives discipline from his father, so the
readers should expect suffering as discipline (<b>12</b>:7-8). <b>(c)</b> As
they respected their parents when they disciplined them, so also they should
respect God when they suffer (<b>12</b>:9). <b>(d)</b> At the time suffering is
grievous, but <b>(e)</b> later it yields peaceful fruits (<b>12</b>:11). (f)
The suffering is temporary (<b>12</b>:10). <b>(g)</b> Discipline does not have
the purpose of breaking a son’s spirit, so he should redouble his efforts when he
suffers (<b>12</b>:12-13).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            So far so good, but
then problems start arising. Some things about this description simply do not
ring true, as clearly shown elsewhere in the Bible. (a) Discipline is
deliberate, but suffering is allowed. (b) Parental discipline is one-for-one
with disobedience, but suffering is not. When a parent spanks his son, he does
it for a specific disobedience. He does not just spank the boy once in a while
to keep him humble or show him who is boss. (c) Parents discipline only their
own children, but suffering happens to non-Christians as well as God’s sons. The
Bible is clear that <u>a</u> suffering does not necessarily correspond with <u>a</u>
sin (the Book of Job; Luke <b>13</b>:1-5; John<b> 9</b>:1-3; Acts<b> 28</b>:1-6)
and that the degree of suffering does not correlate with the degree of
sinfulness (Luke <b>13</b>:1-5; 2 Corinthians<b> 12</b>:7-9; cp. Psalm <b>73</b>;
Jeremiah <b>12</b>:1-2; Malachi <b>3</b>:15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There are crucial
differences between father-son discipline and God-Christian suffering. The way we
look at our suffering must include these <u>mental</u> adjustments or the
suggested <u>attitude</u> toward it does more harm than good. God is not
bringing this into my life to punish me for a sin I committed; rather, he is
not stopping it because he knows I can handle it and grow from it (cp. 1
Corinthians <b>10</b>:13).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            How many times,
though, we have heard people claim that a personal tragedy betrays a secret sin
and that the sufferer should examine himself to identify his fault. Sin,
sickness, and suffering, it is said, have been overcome in Christ; so repent of
the sin to relieve the suffering. If the sufferer objects to such a
reconstruction of his plight, the accuser can put him on the defensive again by
appealing to his guilt complex. And since “nobody’s perfect,” <u>a</u>-suffering-for-<u>a</u>-sin
can seem plausible and may not easily be disproved from <u>experience</u>.
Besides, there are some <u>biblical texts</u> that can be bent into serving that
moralizing view of suffering life. <i>“Do not sin lest a worse thing befall
you”</i> (John <b>5</b>:14); Herod got worms and died because he accepted
divine acclamation for his oratory (Acts<b> 12</b>:20-23); Old Testament
prophets repeatedly tied national catastrophes to apostasy from the worship of
Yahveh only. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Once an idea like
punitive suffering is in place, it is hard to get rid of it. All kinds of
reasons can be thought of to support it, and all kinds of excuses can be made
up to justify it when the picture does not fit. The whole problem originates
from taking Hebrews <b>12</b>:5-13 as reality rather than analogy. Taking it as
reality, however, does not give other clear scriptures their proper value in
the interpretation process. When the parallel starts breaking down, we should
realize that we are dealing with an approximate comparison rather than a strict
explanation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The relevance of
divine discipline to atonement theory lies simply in illustrating the
interpretative approach, how such an approach works, and why it is possible,
legitimate, and necessary. We are not suggesting that divine discipline and
substitutionary atonement themselves are the same kinds of things. Our handling
of the discipline picture for suffering <u>illustrates</u> our handling of
substitution as a picture for atonement. We are not denying one scripture in
preference for another or spiritualizing texts that contradict an idea we
derived by human reason. We are reading substitutionary language figuratively
because elsewhere scripture states things about sin and guilt that would
contradict what substitution language would imply if read literally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The discipline picture
for suffering illustrates why we need not fear that we are pitting human reason
against biblical teaching if we read substitution language as picture rather
than reality. We are not judging whether scripture is reasonable, but whether
human interpreters are using reason properly if their work creates a dilemma
when interpreting scripture—in this case a dilemma between the teaching that
guilt is personal and the idea that our guilt is transferred to Christ as the
mechanism underlying the atonement. Human reason is not judging scripture but
evaluating an interpretation of scripture. We cannot escape the demands of
common sense, and we must not try to do so. Self-consistency is a necessary
test of truth, so self-contradiction means there is a mistake somewhere in the
exegetical enterprise. Dilemmas become disproofs when we assume the Bible is
fully reliable. Refusing to apply the test of self-consistency could lock us
into staying in a false religion, and it can leave us open to accepting false
ideas about the Christian religion. It could, for example, lead us into
believing that every catastrophy we face God has planted in our life to make us
cognizant of some sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The discipline picture
for suffering illustrates the irrelevancy of supposing that since God is
sovereign, he can do what he wants to—as if to say, <i>“Who are we to reply
against God? If he wants to substitute Christ for every sinner who is willing
to accept him as substitute, that is his business.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sovereignty and
omnipotence, however, have nothing to do with overcoming a contradiction. It
would be a contradiction for scripture to teach that guilt and its penalty are
personal and then teach that guilt and its penalty can be transferred from
sinners to Christ. Since God is righteous and holy, his sovereignty is not
capricious. He is not just a god of power but a God of principle, which means
that he sticks with the implications of what he has already created (nature) and
said (revelation). Sovereignty deals with authority and omnipotence deals with
power; neither can solve a logical and natural contradiction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If a person says, “Why
not?” we can simply refuse the negative burden of proof and ask instead <u>why</u>
either authority or power <u>could</u> solve a matter of logic since the
problem and the proposed solutions are different kinds of things. Or we can use
the discipline example again to clarify the problem. We would not tell our
children one thing one time and an opposite thing another time and then, when
they object to the contradiction, tell them that we are in charge here and it
is none of their business (authority) or that we are bigger than they are and
if they don’t be quiet, we’ll spank them some more (power). Even we, being
evil, know how to treat our kids. Likewise, we do not suppose that God does
what conscience would keep us from doing. So to speak, we serve the Christian
Yahveh, and that affects the way Christians go about their interpretation
endeavors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            At least three points
address such a proposal. <b>First</b>, the task is not to <u>disprove</u> John Calvin’s
penal substitution theory. His idea is not already established so as to mean
that we cannot take any other view unless we first unseat his view. That
pattern of thought does not assume the positive burden of proof <u>for</u> that
view. In doing the interpretation work on any subject, there is never a view
already in place; an interpreter ideally starts with a blank sheet; each view shoulders
its own burden of proof. It seems to us that penal substitution cannot bear
that burden in regard to the highest frame of reference, the interpersonal one.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             <b>Second</b>,
supposing that this contradiction is only apparent would only be trying to
remove the concept from investigation. It would be appealing to silence to say
there is an answer to the dilemma, but we do not have access to it, we do not
know what it is, scripture is silent about it. The appropriate question is why
we should think that such a thing is true. Like faithful Abraham, we at least need
to postulate a plausible reason for the apparent contradiction produced by <u>our</u>
interpretation (Hebrews <b>11</b>:17-19). Reason, so help us God, is the only
thing we have to work with; we must use it well rather than set it aside. While
human reason may be inadequate to critique a viewpoint, it is just as likely that
reason was inadequate for constructing that viewpoint in the first place. It is
more reasonable to refuse an apparently self-contradictory concept than to
affirm it with abandon and anathematize anyone that questions it. We have no
guarantee that it represents anything more than other human beings using frail
reason to misinterpret God’s Word. Besides, it is more reasonable to take a
view that does not have apparent contradictions than to choose one that does—which
leads to the next point. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <b>Third</b>,
people usually believe what they believe because they suppose there is nothing
better. But in atonement theory, there is something that seems better than the
rest. We often accept a viewpoint, not because it presents no difficulties, but
because it presents fewer difficulties; and we hold onto it till we find
something better, something with fewer difficulties. But we are not in that
situation with identification. Identification does not seem to involve internal
inconsistencies or contradictions to clear scriptures. Internal inconsistency
is, in fact, the reason we set aside John Calvin’s penal substitution except at
a secondary level in atonement theory and put identification in the ultimate
frame of reference for Christ’s work in laying the basis for our righteousness
pursuant to reconciliation to God.</span></p>

believe, however, that being on good terms with God <u>precedes</u> all other
considerations like living in mansions in glory. Being on good terms with God <u>is

that believe in “eternal security” as distinguished from perseverance of the
