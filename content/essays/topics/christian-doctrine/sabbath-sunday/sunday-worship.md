<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the New Testament we encounter the
Jewish custom of reckoning days from sundown to sundown as distinguished from
the Roman reckoning from midnight to midnight. The question sometimes comes up
whether Christians today could have church on Saturday evening instead of
Sunday morning and/or Sunday evening. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We do not conceive of Sunday as beginning
at dark the night before. It is doubtful that we would be associating Saturday
evening with the Lord’s resurrection day. It would still be, as we say, Saturday
evening. Of course, not all Christian gatherings have to associate the <u>time</u>
of gathering with the time of his resurrection; but it is most appropriate to
incorporate that association into the “stated” gathering time. All clear
passages about the time of gathering in the New Testament place it on Sunday
rather than some other day. Meeting on the day of his resurrection was
consistent enough that <i>“the Lord’s Day”</i> (</span><span lang=EL
style='font-size:12.0pt'>κυριακὴ</span><span lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>ἡμέρα</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>)
became a designation for the first day of the week (Revelation. <b>1</b>:10).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Acts <b>20</b>:7-12 records an evening
gathering of Christians on <i>“the first day of the week”</i> at Troas as Paul
was working his way to Jerusalem for the last time. We could read the account
as describing what took place on our Saturday evening; Paul prolonged his
discourse till midnight, intending to leave the next morning. We could infer a
primarily Jewish congregation and that Paul’s traveling party had no
compunction against unrestrictive traveling on Sunday. If it was Sunday
evening, everything flows as we would expect given a midnight-to-midnight
reckoning for days. They would be meeting that evening with the intention of
leaving Monday morning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The advisability of worshiping on Saturday
evening instead of Sunday morning depends on the motive. If the reason is to
free up Christians for recreation all day the next day or to sleep in all
morning, the practice becomes more questionable. Using interpersonal factors
helps make decisions more of a toss-up; scripture gives no guidelines, so
judgment depends on interpersonal principles to get God’s people through
unrevealed matters they need to solve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. Worship on the first day of a five-day week rather
than a seven-day one</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A few cultures do not have seven-day weeks.
When missionaries go into such societies, they wonder whether they should try
to change that practice or to adjust themselves from a seven-day to a five-day
pattern and consider every fifth day the first day of the week. There are no
guidelines in the New Testament for dealing with such a difficulty. It would
appear that neither approach would be disobedience. What missionaries do might
depend on the people’s openness to changing their system of reckoning. If a
large percentage of the people become Christians, they might be willing to
adopt the new sequence. It would be to their advantage anyway to conform to the
rest of the world if they want to integrate into the international scene.</span></p>

some other day than the first day of the week to be more culturally relevant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This issue is about the binding character
of precedent <i>vs</i>. commandment, because there is no commandment given
about the first day of the week as there was about the Jewish Sabbath. The New
Testament example is <u>uniform</u> and <u>universal</u> throughout the
first-century church in both the Jewish and Gentile territories. There are <u>sufficient
examples</u> to show that a pattern existed, and it was obviously done with approval
at <u>apostolic</u> behest. The terminology <i>“the Lord’s Day”</i> (Revelation
<b>1</b>:10) shows that Christians at the time recognized this day. Though not
necessarily esteemed above other days like the Jewish Sabbath, Sunday had become
the Christians’ stated day of worship. In Acts <b>20</b>:7 Paul waits seven
days at Troas to get to the first day of the week evidently so he could meet
with the local Christians. 1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:1 shows that the gathering
on the first day of the week was customary, not only for the Corinthian
Christians, but for the other churches that were participating in the
ministration for the poor in Jerusalem. No other regular day of worship has any
distinctive meaning for Christians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The choice to meet on Sunday was evidently
deliberate, because it did not conform to the <u>Jewish worship cycle</u>
despite the fact that the first Christians in Palestine and in every Gentile
territory were Jews. It also did not conform to any <u>Gentile pattern</u>. It
means that both Jewish and Gentile adherents had to fit their corporate worship
experiences into a situation that did not give it a natural place. Adherents to
the Way had to carve out this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We are not enthused, then, about putting “seeker
services” in the traditional Christian worship slots for evangelistic purposes
and moving the Christian worship time somewhere else during the week. Surely we
can arrange some other effective system for evangelism that does not displace
worship with outreach. Pragmatism is not the final court of appeals in
Christian practice. Early Christians did not meet on the day they did to be
more “culturally relevant,” whether to Jewish culture with its interest on
Sabbath or to Greek culture with its lack of any recurring day that was
distinctive.</span></p>
