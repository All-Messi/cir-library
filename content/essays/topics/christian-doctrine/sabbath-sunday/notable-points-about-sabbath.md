Mosaic Legislation on Sabbath

Exodus <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:4-5 (manna gathering), 22-30 (manna use); <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:8-11 + Deuteronomy <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:12-15 (The Ten Commandments); Exodus<strong> 31</strong>:12-17;<strong> 35</strong>:1-3; Leviticus <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:3, 30; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:3, 38; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:2; Numbers <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:32-36 (death penalty)

Exodus <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:5ff records the first regulation about Sabbath observance.

Disregarding Sabbath requirements was Israel’s first disobedience (Exodus <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:19-20).

Sabbath was on the analogy of the account of God’s “rest” from creation: weekly (<em>vs</em>. monthly or annually), at the end of the week, observed as a rest (<em>vs.</em> celebration, <em>etc.</em>) as completely as reasonable.

Sabbath was a memorial of the exodus (not the creation): Deuteronomy <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:15; Exodus <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>:17.; hence, Sabbath was a memorial of the exodus observed on the analogy of God’s creation rest.

Sabbath served as a national holiday to be observed as a patriotic duty. It was not observed as a religious duty before, outside, or after national Israel. After Pentecost of Acts <strong>2, </strong>it was abrogated as a Christian expectancy along with the Mosaic covenant in general, <em>“Don’t let anybody criticize you for . . . not celebrating . . . Sabbaths” </em>(Colossians<strong><u> 2</u></strong>:16; cp. Romans <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:5-6; Galatians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:10-11).

Sabbath observance applied to all citizens, slaves, and foreigners in residence or visiting—even to livestock (Exodus <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:10; Deuteronomy <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:13).

Profaning Sabbath was a capital crime (Exodus <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>:15).

The extensive no-work clauses were not exhaustive but representative for creating an understanding of the level, kind, and purpose of the general regulation.

Sabbath was for benefitting people, not burdening them: <em>“Sabbath was created for people, not people for Sabbath”</em> (Mark <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:27 < Exodus <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:13; Deuteronomy <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:14). Jesus’ comment criticized the tradition of the elders, which had made Sabbath a burdensome observance. The Jewish Talmud proscribed and prescribed nearly seventy “picky” activities beyond the Old Testament’s directives (<em>Shabbath </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:3-5).

Jesus’ refusal to follow the tradition of the elders on Sabbath observance became a major point of contention during his ministry. It shows up on six occasions: healing the lame man at the Pool of Bethesda (John <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:1-47 + <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:23), plucking off grain heads (“harvesting,” Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:1-8; Mark <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:23-28; Luke<strong> 6</strong>:1-5), healing a man with a shriveled-up hand (Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:9-14; Mark <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:1-6; Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:6-11), healing a man born blind (John <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:1-16-41), healing a woman bent double (Luke <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:10-17), healing a man with dropsy (Luke <strong>14:</strong>1-24).
