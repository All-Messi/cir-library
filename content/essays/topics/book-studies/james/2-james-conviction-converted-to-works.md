<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In the history of
Christian thought, two opposite tendencies have plagued the church with respect
to human obedience in salvation. From Jewish circles especially, the early
decades of the Christian era saw strong influences to conceive of human action
as producing relationship to God after the fashion of obedience under the
Mosaic Law. The apostle Paul strenuously opposed that effort, especially in his
letters to Rome and Galatia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>From Gentiles circles
came an opposite tendency to consider human action as immaterial since
salvation is by grace. That latter tendency is what James rebukes in the first
two chapters of his letter. With or without the theological and philosophical
undergirding originally involved, letting correct beliefs stand for the whole
range of Christian obligation persists in the modern church as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Compatibility of James and Paul</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—Understanding what significance lies
in obedience to Christ is complicated by a seeming incompatibility between the
writings of Paul and the Book of James on the topic of faith and works. To
understand either writer, we must understand them both or choose between
salvation by faith apart from works, as in Paul, or suppose with James that
salvation comes by faith and works together. This classic difficulty caused the
early Martin Luther to relegate James to secondary position in the New
Testament canon. No consensus has yet been reached on how best to form a united
witness from these two divergent teachings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>One most helpful
observation arises from passages where <i>faith</i> and <i>works</i> appear
together in the New Testament. Since words are clearest in contrast to what
they deny, the threefold manner in which the New Testament joins these terms
points out a direction for resolving the problem. In John <b>6</b>:29 Jesus
considers faith <i>as</i> a work when he says, <i>“This is the work of God:
that you believe on the One he has sent”</i> (cp. <b>3</b>:36; Acts <b>16</b>:30-31).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>According to James <b>2</b>:17,
<i>“Faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself”</i> (cp. <b>2</b>:20,
24, 26). Faith <i>and</i> works issue in salvation. Paul declared to the
Romans, however, <i>“We reckon, then, that people are justified by faith apart
from works of law” </i>(<b>3</b>:28). From top to bottom the accompanying diagrams
picture the relationships of the word meanings as they occur in John <b>6</b>:29,
James, and Paul respectively. Obviously, just from a formal analysis, the
authors are not using these terms to mean the same things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Furthermore, what John
means by <i>works</i> apparently corresponds with what James means by <i>faith
and works</i> and with what Paul means by <i>faith alone</i>, because there is
only one truth about salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In John, <i>works</i>
clearly means “doing something” so that faith is something we do. In Paul,
things are not quite so straightforward; consequently, we need to take a closer
look. The best method begins with discovering what he means by <i>works</i> and
then concluding what <i>faith</i> refers to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The crucial fact is that,
when Paul denies that people are saved by works in Romans <b>3</b>:28, <i>etc</i>.,
he is talking about (a) “<u>works of law</u>” (cp. Romans<b> 3</b>:7; <b>9</b>:32;
Galatians <b>2</b>:16; <b>3</b>:2-5). He speaks clearly in Galatians <b>3</b>:10
about the nature of “works of law” (works in a legal context, works under law) when
he quotes Deuteronomy <b>27</b>:26: “<i>Everyone is accursed that does not
continue to do everything in the Book of the Law.”</i> <i>Continuing</i> to do <i>everything</i>
expresses a (b) <u>perfection</u> concept. Moreover, two verses later he observes
from Leviticus <b>18</b>:5, <i>“The one that does them will have life by them
[not someone else].”</i> People under law are good or bad depending on their
own doing; one person is not guilty for another. Works under law require (c) <u>personal
perfection</u>. From the standpoint of law, any law, the perfection that people
have arises solely for their own “doing.” By <i>works</i>, then, Paul means the
principle of personal perfection; righteousness is living perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Salvation by works is a
contradiction of terms, because perfection (the effect of salvation) is such
that once it’s lost it can’t be achieved again. Even if we lived perfectly from
then on, our perfection would be irretrievably lost. <i>“If there could have
been a law given which could </i>make alive<i>, truly righteousness would have
been by </i>the Law<i>” </i>(Galatians <b>3</b>:21). Paul never depreciates the
Mosaic Law except as a means to salvation. <i>“The Law is holy”</i> (Romans <b>7</b>:12),
but it cannot <i>make holy </i>(Hebrews <b>7</b>:19).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>According to Paul,
another means to righteousness has come about to provide a possibility for
renewing our fellowship with God. If the righteousness requisite for that
relationship cannot come from ourselves after we break perfection, then a
source of righteousness coming from outside ourselves is the only alternative.
That alternative source the apostle labels <i>faith</i>; the principle of trust
in another: <i>“not having a righteousness of my own—that which is of the Law
[of my doing everything commanded by the Law], but what is through faith in
Christ—the righteousness that is of God by </i>faith<i>” </i>(Philippians <b>3</b>:9).
We identify ourselves with God’s Son so that God views us in terms of the ideal
embodied in the perfection of his Son. We “trust” that such an identification—and
its implicit implications—renders us righteous in God’s eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Whereas <i>“works of law”</i>
inherently produce the effect (righteousness) by the obedience of each of us
individually, <i>faith</i> trusts that God will view us as righteous (“give”
the righteousness) for espousing in Jesus Christ the ideal of perfect
righteousness. Faith is non-inherent result. Therefore, the issue for Paul is
not whether we do something but the significance of what we do. Our obedience
relates differently to the resultant righteousness under law and under grace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Trusting is doing
something, but it is not righteousness; it is counted <i>for</i> righteousness
(Romans <b>4</b>:3, 5, 9). Trust is not the cause of righteousness; it is <i>counted</i>
for righteousness. In Paul, <i>faith</i> is not so much the label for an act as
it is the label for a relationship between an act and a result: non-inherent
result. <i>Works</i> is also a label for a relationship between an act and a
result: inherent result. The two terms contrast personal perfection with trust
in another for perfection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In James 2, a different
usage of <i>faith</i> appears. It includes <i>understanding</i> that the
brother or sister is hungry and <i>assent</i> to the fact that they lack daily
food (<b>2</b>:14,15), but active <i>commitment</i> is covered by his other
word <i>works</i>. <i>Faith</i> means inner belief while <i>works</i> addresses
outward behavior. In James, faith is not a saving faith, because the demons
have it and yet tremble in their fear before God. The concerns of Paul and
James, then, are quite different. For Paul the concern has to do with the
significance of our obedience; for James it has to do with the obediences
themselves. In Paul it is <i>why</i> we do; in James it is <i>what</i> we do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The above harmonizing of
Paul and James turns on (1) a difference in the meaning of <i>faith</i> and <i>works</i>.
Other solutions have been proposed for the problem including one based on (2) a
difference in the meaning of the word <i>salvation</i>. Paul is taken to mean
justification while James is understood as referring to sanctification in such
a way that the two authors could be joined together after the manner of
Ephesians <b>2</b>:10: saved by faith for good works. Paul has initial
salvation in mind while James is looking at ultimate salvation. That proposal
seems inadequate since even in Ephesians <b>2</b>:10. saved by works is denied,
while it is affirmed in James <b>2</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Another approach is to
draw up (3) a difference in the kind of faith envisioned. Paul has in mind
saving faith, meaning the kind of faith that does go on and work despite the
fact that the work it goes on to do does not save. On the other hand, James  is
not describing saving faith when he uses faith alone, but is calling for a
faith that works when he puts the two terms together. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Now it may be proper to <u>say</u>
that a saving kind of faith is a faith that works, but the <u>text</u>
indicates, not that we are saved by a faith </span><i><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>that</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'> works, but by faith </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>and</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>
works. So, making the harmonization on a difference in the meaning of </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>faith</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> and </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>works</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> appears to be the best course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The importance of
James</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—As noted in
the opening of this study, the exhortation to active expression of belief (<b>1</b>:22-27;
<b>2</b>:10-26;<b> 3</b>:13; <b>4</b>:17) was needed in the ancient church on
account of (a) antinomianism, the idea that it does not matter what we do
(Romans <b>3</b>:5-8; 1 John <b>3</b>:3-12). Another problem among the Jews was
(b) presuming upon ancestry from Abraham as a basis for privilege (Luke <b>3</b>:7-8).
A third was (c) knowing, hearing, having the oracles of God in contrast to the
ignorant heathen (Romans <b>2</b>:17-29; James <b>2</b>:19).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In post-apostolic times, an
additional problem arose to which this book has a contemporary relevance: (d)
eternal security, also termed “once in grace always in grace.” There are three
views on our continued association with Christ. One view is that of </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>apostasy</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>: if people fall away from living the
Christian life, becoming the same as they were before, they are no longer in a
saved condition; they have lost their status with Christ. A second view is that
people who experience genuine conversion will persevere till the end: </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>perseverance of the saints.</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> If they enter again into their
former manner of life, they were never saved in the first place. The third is
that even if they do forsake the Christian life, they are still going to
heaven: </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>eternal
security</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Perseverance of the
saints agrees with the apostasy position in tying Christian living to salvation
status so that, whether genuinely saved or not in the beginning, people under
either construct are lost in the end if they forsake Christ in everyday living.
Perseverance takes the scripture as promising that God will bring new concerts
through safely to the end of life. He protects them from being tempted above
what they can bear (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:13). We may question, however,
whether people always do what they can do. In that area of difference between
what they can do and what they do, apostasy may occur. From a practical
standpoint, nevertheless, the big concern is not so much with perseverance
because everything comes out the same.</span></p>
