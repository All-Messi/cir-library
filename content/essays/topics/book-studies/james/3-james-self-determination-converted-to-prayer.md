TO PRAYER</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:.25in;text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Virgil Warren, PhD</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Perhaps our prayer life
most accurately indicates the level of our spiritual development. It is no
surprise, then, to find James including encouragements about prayer in his
letter to Christians beset by self-centeredness (<b>1</b>:5-8, 16-18; <b>4</b>:2-3,
13-15; <b>5</b>:13-18). They needed to convert their complaining,
self-determination, and self-interest into prayer, dependence on God, and
concern for one another. In this connection we have selected for special
consideration the effectiveness of prayer, the importance of divine guidance,
and the prayer ministry of elders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Effectiveness of
prayer</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—James joins
the authors of the gospels in affirming the effectiveness of prayer by
encouraging his readers (<b>1</b>:5-8) to ask for wisdom and (<b>5</b>:13-18)
to request healing and forgiveness, even as Elijah prayed for both drought and
rain. Truth is, God gives his children the needs indicated in their prayers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In many texts it goes
without saying that the “yes” answer comes to petitions falling within the will
of God (John <b>14</b>:13-15; <b>15</b>:7, 16; <b>16</b>:23-24; 1 John <b>5</b>:14).
The writers are not speaking of a “name-it-claim-it” attitude when they deal
with the opposite extreme all too prevalent among us: <i>“It doesn’t make any
differences.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>God is not a genie in a
lamp we rub whenever want something. If that were the case, there would be less
need for conversion from the self-centered mentality that James wants to
eradicate from his readers. Answered prayer always means God’s choosing in
terms of his purposes; it is not an automatic response to our desires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>God’s choice to say “yes”
relates to his will regarded (a) <i>objectively </i>as to what it is and (b) <i>subjectively</i>
as to the condition of us who ask. He answers in harmony with his purposes in
both creation and redemption, and in light of the extent to which our human personalities
conform to his divine ideal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Relative to the latter
concern, James mentions the conditions of (1) <i>righteousness</i></span>: <i>“A</i><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> righteous person’s supplication
avails much”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> (<b>5</b>:16);
(2) <i>earnestness</i>:<i> “[Elijah] prayed fervently for it not to rain</i>; (<b>5</b>:17);
(3<i>) confidence</i>:<i> “[Doubters] should not think they are going to
receive anything from the Lord”</i> (<b>1</b>:17; cp. Matthew <b>17</b>:19-21; <b>21</b>:18-22;
Mark <b>9</b>:23; <b>11</b>:24); and (4) <i>selflessness</i>:<i> “You don’t
receive when you ask, because you ask with the wrong motive so you can spend it
on your pleasures” </i>(<b>4</b>:3; cp. Matthew <b>6</b>:5). Other writers add
(5) proper relationship to other people (Matthew <b>5</b>:23-24) and various
virtues of the Christian calling. The privilege of bestowed blessings hinges on
responsibility for Christian virtue.              </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In the full light of
promised efficacy in prayer, we nevertheless know that not all our own prayers
have been answered “yes,” even when they seem to fall within God’s revealed
will. (1) <i>Personal Christian experience</i> does not bear out uniform
results equivalent to wisdom, healing, or rain. Are we then to question our
relationship to Christ or the satisfactory quality of our faith? Do we doubt
the truth of scripture on this subject? Neither option seems so likely as re-evaluating
the intended meaning of particular texts in view of the general biblical context.
The proper inference appears to be that legitimate requests offered by mature
Christians may nevertheless be withheld.     </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In keeping with such an
inference, (2) <i>biblical examples</i> of denial apparently confirm our
personal experience. Jesus denied petitions from his disciples while still
among them: why not afterward too? Paul’s thorn in the flesh was not removed.
James (the brother of John) was not delivered from Herod’s sword (Acts <b>12</b>:1)
despite the likelihood that John prayed as much for him as he did for Peter,
who was supernaturally released during the same wave of persecution. Jesus’ own
prayers for deliverance from crucifixion and for the unity of his disciples did
not issue in his desire result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Among the options for
interpretation, we may consider the following. Is the statement, <i>“Whatever
you ask in my name believing</i>,<i>” </i><b>(a) </b>a promise about <i>kind</i>
rather than frequency? In other words, are all <i>kinds</i> of benefits
available through Jesus in contrast to just certain ones (John <b>11</b>:22; <b>15</b>:7),
it being another matter whether they are always given? Is it <b>(b)</b> a
contrast between <i>one thing</i> and something else? Does Jesus promise that
we do not receive a scorpion for requesting an egg, a stone for a loaf, or a snake
for a fish when we pray to the Father (Matthew<b> 7</b>:7-11; Luke <b>7</b>:9-13)?
Is <b>(c)</b> the contrast between <i>my name</i> and in some other way (John <b>14</b>:13-14;
<b>16</b>:23-27)? All three points are interesting and in fact true, but they do
not eliminate receiving everything we ask for. As a result, it is better to
infer that <b>(d) </b>some passages make truly universal, or absolute,
statements <i>within the assumed limitations</i> of God’s general will for all
people and his specific will for each of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In given experiences, then,
we may look at the issue as governed by two contrasting principles: <i>“Whatever
you ask in my name believing you will receive”</i> (Matthew <b>21</b>:22, <i>etc.</i>)
and <i>“My grace is sufficient for you” </i>(2 Corinthians <b>12</b>:9). The
first speaks of God’s inclination to help us; the second refers to his
self-restraint unto our helping ourselves. One has to do with privileges, the
other with responsibilities. Thus, security in knowing that <i>God</i> “cares”
and “can,” combines with self-reliance in doing what <i>we</i> can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Providence and
guidance—</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Granting
our petitions arises from special divine providence in which effects occur that
would not have happened without prayer. Not granting them arises from general
providence, which is carried forward by the laws of nature, also established
for accomplishing God’s will. Among those laws, God purposely included the
limiting factors of death and attendant processes that force us to acknowledge our
dependent state, hence, Paul’s statement that his thorn in the flesh was for
keeping him humble. Removing such infirmities lies within God’s power to
perform and constitutes legitimate requests; but we must remember that besides
“yes” there are “no,” “not now,” and “if” answers as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Neither the sufficiency
of common grace through natural process nor the possibility of special grace
through supernatural dispensation are uniform modes of operation God uses in
fulfilling his general will. God’s principles operating in natural law do not
contradict those made known through special revelation. Our parochial viewpoint
and self-interest cloud our minds and cause us to focus on one to the exclusion
of the other. God does not violate his other principles when he operates on the
principle that whatever we ask in faith we will receive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In the final analysis,
there is no way to evaluate what supplications he will favor, nor is it evident
what should be our expectancy on the proportion of “yes” answers. The
proportion correlates with the quality of our lives and conformity to God’s
revealed will for all Christians. There remains, however, the unknown factor of
his specific will for our life at the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We can accept the promise
that God grants us all our requests minus the ones that are contrary to his
revealed will, the ones that arise from selfish motives and inappropriate
qualities, the ones discordant with God’s other principles of operation
revealed and otherwise, and minus those that would remove growth potential.
Answered prayer is not necessarily subject to the scientific principles of
direct verification and falsification because a control situation cannot easily
be established. We believe these truths about answered prayer, not because we
can prove it experientially, but because we believe the promise he has made to
us in his word. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>James assumes that we
must conduct ourselves in harmony with the principles and values of the
Christian faith. When he addresses the question of specific guidance in our
individual lives, he does not speak directly about seeking guidance by prayer
perhaps because God does not tell us explicitly each move to make. James
concentrates instead on the attitude of submission in everyday living. We are
to say, <i>“The Lord willing, we will do this or that” </i>(<b>4</b>:13-15). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:-4.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The approach he advocates contrasts not only with
disregarding Christian values in decision-making, but with making appropriate
decisions and then calling on God for help to fulfill them. Such a method still
establishes us as the deciding factor and God as someone we use for furthering
our own purposes. There may be nothing wrong with traveling to another city for
a year on business, but the manner of deciding to do it can be wrong. Defective
procedure is a concern because on occasion it yields defective results. In this
case, it also detracts from the glory of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Healing ministry of
the presbytery</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—One
of the more controversial sections in the Book of James is<b> 5</b>:13-18,
where he tells the sick to summon the presbytery for prayer and anointing. Two
questions arise here: Is he dealing with answered prayer or express miracle?
Does the instruction have to do with simple example or fixed precedent? We
consider them briefly in the following order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Assuming the validity of
these distinctions, we point out elements in the text that associate this
procedure with answered prayer. <b>(1)</b> <i>The context establishes prayer as
the primary subject.</i> Although prayer sometimes accompanied our Lord’s
healings (John <b>11</b>:41-44; Mark <b>9</b>:29), it was not a uniform part in
his practice. In James <b>5</b>, however, prayer precedes, pervades, and
succeeds the instruction to call the elders. The elders’ work itself centers on
prayer (<b>5</b>:14), and, strictly speaking, it is the “prayer of faith” that
saves the person from the sickness (<b>5</b>:15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>(2)</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> If this circumstance envisions
miracles, we may wonder whether <i>a person could avert death</i> by constantly
availing himself of miraculous recovery by way of the presbytery. The certainty
of recovery here (<b>5</b>:15) does not exceed the certainty worded in
association with answered prayer in <b>1</b>:5 and <b>5</b>:17-18. Inasmuch as
the text does not have to be read as more certain than answered prayer, it
cannot serve as evidence for a universal miraculous ministry by the presbytery
in the first century or the present.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>B. <i>The procedure as
simple example</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We distinguish “fixed
precedent” from “simple example” in that the former is done with the intention
of being followed in the subsequent church age while the latter simply indicates
an appropriate way ancient believers dealt with sickness. Fixed precedent looks
on the procedure as a pattern to be carried out in much the same way as we
understand baptism and the Lord’s supper. It is the <i>elders</i> who <i>pray</i>
and <i>anoint with olive oil in the name of the Lord.</i> If the formula is
followed, the results are forthcoming; if not, the guarantee is void.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Among the marks of
precedent </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>vs</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>. example is uniform practice in the
apostolic era. Other patterns for healing found in New Testament literature
incorporate other acts, especially the laying on of hands; some instances have
non-elders involved; in other cases, part of this ritual is not included,
namely, the anointing with oil. Mark <b>6</b>:13, in fact, is the only other
example that involves olive oil. Even within the paragraph under consideration
another pattern appears, a righteous person being the only clear stipulation in
<b>5</b>:16 as to personnel and only prayer being specified as to procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>It appears from these considerations
that the procedure described by James could be used but should not be required;
it is example rather than precedent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Conclusion</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—Christianity calls for conversion.
Change from egocentric behavior to concern for others lies at the heart of true
religion according to the Book of Jemes. Doing more than assenting assures that
people-for-themselves become people-for-others. So doing commits to the
priority of God over self so that prayer does not just provide another avenue
for self-determination, but a determination for the self by the One who hears
our prayers and directs our lives.</span></p>
