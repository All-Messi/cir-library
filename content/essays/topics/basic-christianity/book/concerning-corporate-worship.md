<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As with most experiences, worship involves
structural/form-al and affective/ emotional elements. It deals with the
patterns we use privately and corporately; it involves also the impact these
patterns make on us. Definitions of the term <i>worship</i> differ according to
one emphasis or the other; hence, they range from I-Thou vertical relationship,
on the one hand, to subjective religious effect, on the other. One describes
worshiping; the other refers to what is worshipful. What different people mean
by <u>worship</u> varies, but the structural components of gathered worship
itself are readily identifiable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A natural set of structural components is
the vertical, the horizontal, and the introspective. They center around where people
direct their conscious minds. In vertical relationship the second person is
God; in horizontal relationship it is others present in the gathering; in the
introspective the person addresses himself and meditates on things divine. In
the <u>vertical</u>, people address God as second person in prayer, giving,
vertically directed songs, and in the Lord’s Supper. In the <u>horizontal</u>
belongs preaching, songs of witness and exhortation as well as testimonies and
body-life activities—a significant majority timewise of what occurs in most
church services. The <u>introspective</u> includes meditation and
self-application. Together these three dimensions comprise what happens when
Christians congregate for religious exercises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The affective-emotional attachments to
worship have much to do with subjective preference for the forms worship may
use. Insofar as non-moral mechanics of worship impress people differently,
custom and expectancy dictate whether a person deems a given practice
worshipful. Inasmuch as subjective preference is learned behavior, it can also
be unlearned or relearned when circumstances make it advisable to do so.
Because form and meaning are inherently separable, meanings may be attached to,
or detached from, their accompanying forms of expression. What forms are
uplifting can therefore be broadened by invoking the human capacity for
self-transcendence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is obvious that at least initially
Christians can respond positively or negatively to the same thing. <u>Verbal
response</u> during presentation will appear to some as exhortation to the
speaker but to others as distracting, attention-getting behavior. Some will see
<u>clapping response</u> as praise of the performer while others mean it as
appreciation for the ministry of the performer. <u>Touch</u> will carry
romantic or sexual innuendoes rather than sincere interpersonal affection. <u>Action
songs</u> will feel silly and frivolous to some, but to others they are joyous,
celebrative, and total-person expressive. <u>Non-keyboard instrumentation</u>
may create a secular atmosphere for traditionalists, but seem natural and
up-to-date to new Christians and younger people. <u>Prominent percussion</u>
and <u>loud volume</u> will connote frenzy and self-abandonment to those with
classical tastes, but the absence of volume, the beat, clapping, action, and
touch will come across as staid and boring to people who have developed that
expectancy in Christian assemblies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The conclusion seems to be that worship is
best defined primarily in structural terms with affective considerations left
out because they are not constants, and because they are results on the
participant instead of actions by him. Consequently, worship is a <u>conscious,
spontaneous self-expression to God as a present, superior, second person</u>.
It is therefore not <u>meditation</u>, where God is at best a third-person
entity; nor is it <u>communion</u>, which highlights a sense of divine presence
aside from I-Thou association. Worship is not horizontally directed to other
people by voice, action, or mechanical instrumentation. It is not habitual,
recitative, ritualistic, or stimulus-response. It is not so much what lifts up
the worshipper, as what lifts up God. <u>Worship</u> presumably draws on the
imagery of the Greek word it translates: <i><u>proskyneo</u></i> (</span><span
lang=EL style='font-size:12.0pt'>προσκυνλέω</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>),
which pictures a person kneeling or prostrate before another. Therefore,
worship is a vertical, interpersonal activity from people to God that creates
in the participant various affective responses depending on circumstances,
background, and personality.</span></p>
