INTRODUCTION


A.	Interpersonal relationship <em>vs</em>. mystical flight of the soul to God


1.	Transcendental meditation

2.	Approaching God through a priest or other intermediary

3.	Symbolic ritual (Lord’s Supper)


B.	Important examples of biblical prayers


1.	Dedication of the temple: 1 Kings <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:23-53 = 2 Chronicles <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:14-42

2.	Model Prayer: Matthew <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:9-13

3.	High Priestly Prayer: John <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:1-26

4.	Disciples’ Prayer: Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24-30


C.	Jesus prayed all night before he chose the Twelve; perhaps some meditation was included during that time: Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:12



I. USING ALL THE PRAYER ELEMENTS (as wide a range of expressions as

talking has)


A.	Talking normally weaves all kinds of things together and so does Jesus in

John <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>.


1.	Rehearsed what happened: John <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:6, 12, 25

2.	Stated things at the time: John <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:7

3.	Quoted scripture: Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:25-26


B.	Request (supplication on behalf of another person): Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:29

C.	Praise (adoration): Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24

D.	Thanksgiving: Luke <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:21 (cp. acknowledging in Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24)

E.	Confession: Luke <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:13

F.	Promise



II. CORRECTING WEAK PRAYER PATTERNS


TALKING can correct praying . . .


A.	Infrequently

B.	In vague generalities


C.	Only in group situations

D.	Really fast

E.	In vain repetition (Matthew <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:7)

F.	Only memorized, canned, or read prayers

G.	In the wrong directions (to other people) (for show)

H.	In archaic English

I.	With an artificial voice and intonation



III. DEVELOPING A STRONGER PRAYER LIFE


A.	Talking (public and private); not worrying about . . .


1.	having all the prayer elements in each prayer

2.	an outline (Matters can be interwoven: 1 Kings <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:23-26.)

3.	being eloquent (It does not have to be an oratorical masterpiece.

4.	using Old English

5.	being “fluent” (no pauses) even in public prayer

6.	making it long


B.	Changing some daydreaming into prayer


Freshening by changing some of the postures you use:


C.	Praying with our eyes open (Closing the eyes is probably our way of “going 				into the private room.”)


Examples:	Matthew <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:19	(feeding of the 5,000)

Mark <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:34  	(healing the deaf-mute)

John <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:1		(Jesus’ high priestly prayer)

John <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:41-42	(resurrection of Lazarus)

Acts<strong> 7</strong>:55   	(Stephen’s martyrdom)


There is not much in scripture about praying with the eyes shut.


D.	Praying out loud


1 Corinthians <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:28

There is not much about silent prayer in scripture.

Ancients read out loud; cp. Ethiopian eunuch in Acts <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:30.


E.	Kneeling (1 Kings <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:22, 54; Acts <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:36). Other postures in scripture are standing (1 Kings <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:20) and prostrating oneself (Matthew <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:39).

F.	Lifting up the hands.

G.	Praying specifically. Lengthens prayer and makes it more real.

H.	Praying for something more than once


Matthew <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:39, 42, 44 (Gethsemane; three times)

1 Corinthians <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:8 (Paul’s thorn in the flesh; three times)


Some other mechanics


I.	Establishing a specific times to pray: Acts <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:1 (an hour of prayer)

J.	Noting down things to pray about

K.	Keeping a prayer journal

L.  	Praying with someone.



CONCLUSION


A.	Talking removes artificial things from our prayers (public and private).

B.	Talking makes prayer a more fulfilling experience because prayer is then done

in conformity to what we really are: persons.
