INTRODUCTION


A.	We communicate three main ways: touch

movement (kinesics)

facial expressions

gestures

talking (words and how you say them)


B.	The capacity for speech marks us as human beings


1.	<em>vs.</em> animals, which cannot very well pass on to other generations what they

have learned


RESPONSIBILITY		Thomas Mann: <em>“Speech is civilization.”</em>


2.	Speech enables word-revelation from God to profit us.


PRIVILEGE


C.	Consider how many (virtues and) vices are connected with speaking.


lying		     blasphemy		taking the Lord’s name in vain

boasting	     swearing		insulting

gossiping					filthy talking


D.	James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:2b-12


<em>“We are known by the company we keep.”</em>

<em>					“We are what we read.”</em>

<em>					“We are what we do.”</em>

<em>					“We are what we say and </em><em><u>we say what we are</u></em><em>.”</em>



OUR CONVERSATION .  .  .


I. REVEALS WHAT WE ARE.


Conversation is the way we let other people see down inside us: <em>“Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks”</em> (Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:34).


A.	Fear


insecurity					                   emotional overlay

weakness					       aggressive/hostile talk/vulgarism

feeling out of self-control		                    competitive talk


1.	Four subjects		2.	Effects	3.     Situation


sex					shock value	         frustration

excrement			unconventionalness	         low self-image

impropriety


race				dehumanizes/depersonalizes/assaults

deity                            	depersonalizes


As a person strengthens and ages, these verbal behaviors tend to disappear.


B.	Inner conflict


Christians often do not talk appropriately while at home or at work.


C.	Note the value of counseling


Communication gives release; it “gets it off our chest.”

We conquer our fears by capturing them with words. This is the same thing

turned for good that goes into vulgarism when it is turned rotten.



II. CONNECTS US WITH OTHER PERSONS.


Communication is a way of transferring ourselves to another person.


The importance of communication in healing         			    family

maintaining   relationships in   marriage

improving                                 church

business


A.	Reveals ourselves


B.	Builds up the other person


1.	Edification/teaching/prophesying

2.	Encouragement

3.	Affirmation: Praising other people establishes bonds.

4.	Compliment (blessing)


C.	Elicits the other’s self


Thanksgiving is gratitude expressed.


We get into the habit of not talking so that other people do not know what is on our

minds.


RESULTING GUIDELINE: DETERMINE WHAT WE SAY BY WHETHER IT

BUILDS RELATIONSHIPS



III. SETS THE DIRECTION FOR OUR FUTURE.


A.	With other people and with what we can and will do together


honesty/lying example


B.	Ultimate destiny


Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:37: <em>“You will be justified by your words, and you will be </em>

<em>							      condemned by them.”</em>



IV. OUR CONVERSATION CAN BE CHANGED.


Conversation patterns are kinds of habits. Habits can be changed by substituting some acceptable behavior. Instead of trying to stop certain conversation patterns, replace them with something else.


A.	Start doing things for people that will change our attitudes toward them.


Make a deliberate effort to encourage and compliment.


B.	Start doing things that will raise our level of God-consciousness.


It will direct us away from habitually swearing and using the Lord’s name in

vain.


God is the silent listener to every conversation.


C.	Spiritual exercises will strengthen the inner self.


Remove the unnamed fears         that erupt in unacceptable talk.
