Most New Testament directives about giving relate to the offering Paul took up on the third missionary journey for the poor saints in Jerusalem: Romans <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:25-28; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:1-4; 2 Corinthians <strong>8-9</strong>; Galatians<strong> 2</strong>:10.


I. Nature of Giving

A.	Giving ourselves: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:5

B.	Ministry: 1 Corinthians<strong> 9</strong>:6-14; 1 Timothy <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:17-18 (“honor,” cp. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:3)

E.	cheerfully: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:7


<strong>NOT</strong>

H.	grudgingly: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:7

I.	out of necessity: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:7

A.	with liberality: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:2

B.	abundantly: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:7

C.	as a proof/expression of (the sincerity of) love: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:8, 24

D.	according to ability: Acts <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:29; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:3, 11-12; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:2 (<em>“As God has prospered you.”</em>)

E.	that there may be equality: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:14

F.	according to need: Acts<strong> 2</strong>:45; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:35; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:12

There is no amount or portion that is commanded.

There is no amount less than all that is more sacred than the rest—no “sacred portion” as under the Law of Moses.

The principles of giving are like those associated with most other Christian graces: there is no way to quantify righteousness or legislate goodness in an interpersonal system.

“Tithing,” that is, giving a tenth, was primary element in the Old Testament taxation system. There is no place in the New Covenant where tithing is commended, commanded, or practiced as a Christian principle.


VI. Practical suggestions

A.	Doing your giving first.

B.	Keeping your giving concrete—relative to specific uses (Philippians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:10-20).

C.	Using giving as a way of focusing your commitment and expressing love.
