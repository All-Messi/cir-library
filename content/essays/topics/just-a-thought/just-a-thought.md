<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Not only is God
someone we <u>don’t</u> see; he is someone we <u>can’t</u> see (1 Timothy <b>3</b>:16).
We may wonder, though, why he doesn’t show himself someway at least once in a
while. He could speak to us audibly or give us a vision of himself from time to
time. The short answer to the question is, “We don’t know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>On second
thought, maybe it is best this way. Would we relish being reminded that he is
watching our every move or knowing everything that goes through our minds? How <u>free</u>
would we feel if God acted like a micromanager? Would we live in constant <u>fear</u>
of failure or be always self-conscious about our inadequacies? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Maybe he is
being gracious to us by keeping out of sight. Maybe he is showing confidence in
us that we will do the best we can with as little prompting as possible. After
all, we want to be treated like adults.</p>
