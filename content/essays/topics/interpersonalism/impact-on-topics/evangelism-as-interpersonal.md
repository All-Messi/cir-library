<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            One important ramification
of the interpersonal nature of the gospel is that it applies to every person. The
only qualification for receiving it is being a person, someone with the interpersonal
capacity. The gospel does not have to do with birds and animals (contra Francis
of Assisi). Christianity is not an elitist religion for a particular caste or nation,
for heads of state, intellectuals (as in Gnosticism), the rich, the educated,
the freeman, the adult, the righteous, or the married, but for every person. <i>“I
did not come so much to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance”</i>
(Luke <b>5</b>:32). It is for as many as have sinned, experienced alienation
(lost), and stand in need of reconciliation (saved).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is not a territorial
religion with a territorial god or a particular race or national entity, as
Judaism used to be, but goes into the whole world (Matthew<b> 28</b>:19). So,
it was not for Jews <i>vs</i>. Gentiles, Samaritans, uncircumcised, or
barbarians, but for all tribes and families of the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>  II. The Beginning Place of Evangelism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism begins with the hearer’s
present sense of need for love, security, meaningfulness, and innocence. All
these prime needs are interpersonal matters. They provide Christ’s witnesses
with points of contact. Such starting places do not depend on where people
live, what century they are born in, or the level of their society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> III. The Atmosphere for Evangelism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism takes place in an
atmosphere of caring instead of condemnation (John<b> 3</b>:16). What the
gospel says was Jesus’ fundamental purpose in the incarnation must surely
characterize the messengers who carry out his mission. They, the body of
Christ, serve as the equivalent of his incarnation in the world. The goal of
the gospel is redemptive because it is interpersonal, not condemnatory because
it is legalistic (John <b>3</b>:17; Romans <b>4</b>:15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism speaks the truth
in love, or it does not speak truthfully. The medium—personal proclamation
through a quality personality—is itself part of the message in accordance with
McLuhen’s dictum <i>“the medium is the message.” </i>Proclaiming Christian love
in an unloving way is self-contradictory, self-defeating, and not possible. The
motive of missions is the glory of God; the motive of missions is retrieving the
alienated. Condemnation comes at the end of the process by the Lord himself
(John <b>3</b>:18b). Salvation comes meantime by the work of people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> IV. What Evangelism Is</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism consists of good
news about a person—God, a personal savior, and a personal reward. It centers
on how a person can come back into relationship with God. Evangelism is
interpersonal in that it is a call to identify with the person Jesus Christ (2
Corinthians <b>5</b>:18-21). Evangelism presents a Person in keeping with Paul’s
idea of “preaching Christ” (2 Corinthians <b>4</b>:5, <i>etc</i>.). Christianity
does not present Jesus as a prophet who teaches but as a savior who reconciles.
Anyone can teach information who happens to know it. The exclusivism of
Christianity <i>vs</i>. other worldviews comes from the indivisibility of a
person. Full identification with a person cannot be shared (Matthew <b>6</b>:24).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism calls for
identification with Christ rather than (1) joining a church, becoming part of
an <u>institution</u>, which is impersonal. Evangelism is a call to identify
with Christ more than (2) a presentation of a <u>doctrinal understanding</u>, an
impersonal thing again. The concern here contrasts with overzealousness about
issues like what personal name to call God or whether eternal life is on earth
or in heaven. Evangelism is even more basically a call to commitment to Christ
than (3) a call for a way of life, acting, or doing—<u>a moral code</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The character of evangelism comes
from the character of the content it delivers. It delivers a message about
joining persons to persons, which implies some “elbow room” relative to
correctness of conceptual understanding or success in moral behavior. Relationships
do not cease because of some degree of failure in thinking or acting. By
putting Jesus central, we provide motivation for calling people to live in ways
compatible with Christ’s values (see also under “Morality”). By putting him
central, we offer a tangible way of seeing Truth in a unified field of
knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism, preaching,
communication, and apologetics represent different kinds of education. Effectiveness
can draw on education theory. “Readiness” relates to prioritizing “receptive
peoples.” Readiness is often created by factors beyond the educator’s control: political
circumstances, social drift, and the like. The educator can use other factors
to foster readiness—the educator’s own character, the style of delivery, and so
on. Demonstrating and modeling what someone is “selling” increases the
likelihood of a accepting it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Morality cannot be
legislated,” we say. Moralizing does not work very well. Behavior must be
internalized or there is conformity without conviction. Enforceability comes
into the picture because we cannot see people’s heart; people can lie.          </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            What happens is that, to be enforceable,
laws end up being written on a humanistic and scientific base. Laws tend to be
restrictive and preventive while love is positive and proactive. Hopefully, by
human government the social condition will achieve a relatively stable level,
but state statutes will control only the grosser degrees and overt kinds of unacceptable
behavior. So we resign ourselves to saying that human government has a
restrictive role, eliminating the worst evils and down (Romans <b>13</b>:1-4);
religion has a positive one, working from the least virtues and up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The interpersonal character
of Christianity leads to our not relying on a nation’s legislative, executive,
and judicial processes to bring about all matters of morality. Even more
particularly, we do not base our outreach on how people should live. Instead,
we hold up Christ, introduce people to God as a person, and draw attention to
His loving attitude toward them and to his efforts at calling them back to himself
for their own good. His character appears in that process, and the values of
human living emerge as the person of Christ is set forth. This scenario takes a
more positive approach: “God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life,”
rather than a negative one: <i>“If you died tonight, would you go to hell?”</i>
This corresponds with the approach of John <b>3</b>:1<b>7</b>: God did not so
much send his Son into the world to condemn it as to save it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The ethical-moral values of
another <u>person</u> have more drawing power than abstract ethical-moral
values. Example and influence add drawing power. Righteousness has more pull behind
the outstretched hands of a smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> V. The Means of Evangelism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Evangelism cannot be
accomplished by <u>proclamation</u> alone, and certainly not by the <u>military</u>
endeavors of a political kingdom, as Judaism had envisioned. Evangelism calls people
to decision, not acquiescence under compulsion. It is by spirit and word interpersonalized.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Both Jesus and Paul set
aside the model of liberation theology, the accomplishing Christian goals by
political means. In Gethsemane Jesus tells Peter to put up his sword; those who
live by it die by it (Luke <b>22</b>:35-38, 49-51). They did not set civil
religion aside because the church’s small beginnings dictated against it. Christianity
cannot remedy the world’s ills from the top down to the individual, by
extrinsic rather than intrinsic motivation. The Christian faith works from
individuals upward and outward like leaven (Matthew <b>13</b>:33; Luke <b>13</b>:21),
a metaphor for influence. It does not adopt the political approach to improving
the “quality of life.” If the very structure of society has evil embedded in
it, the change will need to come through the interpersonal sector. The
inquisition was completely foreign to anything exemplified in the New
Testament. The body of Christ is not an institution, so it does not move
forward by institutional means. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>     For these reasons, Christianity
cannot depend on cultural and legal reinforcement of its values. Its people
must live on a higher plane than the legal requirements around them. Christian
values must be internalized, not etched on stone tablets on a mountain or printed
in paper documents at a capitol building. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Evangelism cannot
appropriately be accomplished by <u>emotional manipulation</u> as in high-pressure
salesmanship. It is by persuasion, not pressure (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:11). Evangelism
calls to <u>decision</u> rather than by <u>stimulus-response</u>. The gospel
calls to authentic existence, meaningful existence, life. The unreasoned life
is not worth living (Socrates). It brings people to choose, which requires
proceeding by values (in terms of which to make choices) rather than by <u>drives</u>
(the feeling of pain or desire). Decision-making calls for conscious living
rather than unconscious routine, following lures and being impelled by drives
or cultural conventions. It calls people to plan rather than eventuate, to live
by their higher nature instead of their animal nature. It calls people to (a) <i>to
transcend the flesh</i>, (b) <i>to project past the present into the future</i>,
and (c) <i>to live</i> <i>from the other person’s viewpoint as well as their
own</i>. Likewise, the point is not to make proclamation into oratory, as Paul emphasizes
in 1 Corinthians <b>2</b>. It is not by rhetorical eloquence but by personal
power that conversion comes (1 Corinthians<b> 2</b>:4-5).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Evangelism calls for <u>belief</u>
and <u>commitment</u>, for <u>faith-trust</u> in Another. In addition, <u>repentance</u>
covers the change of mind, feelings, and will, as well as the actions that flow
from them. Repentance covers positive change so personal relationships can
renew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Evangelism cannot be
accomplished by duress as in state religions past and present. Disenfranchising
the unconverted, putting them under economic strain, or otherwise intimidating
them creates the adverse effect. State religions like Islam and communism have
demonstrated repeatedly the long-term failure of such a method. A psychological
connection exists between <u>military, legal, or physical</u> force and duress
like <u>social</u> and<u> emotional</u> pressure on others. The large crowds at
Billy Graham or Luis Palau crusades are for enhancing voluntary response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Included in this stricture
on duress is not using fear tactics. The sermons in the Book of Acts do not end
with threats about what happens if the audience rejects the message. There is
not even a prominent appeal to guilt. People already know they are guilty;
driving them deeper into it only creates resistance. People need help, not
another kind of criticism. The best motivational techniques are interpersonal
ones; techniques that manipulate and pressure are not interpersonal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since extension of the
kingdom is interpersonal, the process is not accomplished by <u>supernatural causation</u>.
Faith comes <i>by </i>hearing, not <i>parallel to</i> hearing, as with a
theology that requires supernatural operation parallel to the proclamation to
enable response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <u>way</u> to spread the
kingdom must fit with the <u>kind</u> of kingdom it is and the <u>purpose</u> it
has. If the kingdom is not of this world, it does not advance by worldly means.
It is “heavenly,” transcendent, spiritual, interpersonal. The method of
expansion is interpersonal because the kingdom is interpersonal in kind and its
purpose is to restore personal relationships vertically and horizontally. No
method that depersonalizes is appropriate for accomplishing the Great
Commission. The manner of extending the kingdom retains both the hearer’s and
speaker’s integrity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Marshall McLuhen
popularized the notion that the “medium is the message,” which somewhat
overstates the fact that (a) <i>the medium is part of the message</i> because
the medium itself communicates something. A related fact is that (b) <i>the
medium must be compatible with the</i> <i>message</i>. The container must be
compatible with the content. You cannot carry water in a sieve. McLuhen’s claim
fits strikingly well with the concern for spreading an interpersonal reality in
interpersonal ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Missiologists talk about
incarnational mission. The incarnation of Jesus from heaven into the human race,
serves as an <u>example</u> and <u>model</u> of “missions” as to means, manner,
and message. Hebrews <b>1</b>:1-2 describes the concept eloquently. Incarnation
is identification. In calling people to identify with Jesus, messengers identify
with their hearers. They regard themselves as one of them rather than someone
above them. They limit themselves to their frame of life, own their problems
and concerns, suffer with and for them, demonstrate the power to cope, and show
the difference that relationship to God can make in their situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             In McLuhen’s terms, the
Bible and propositional revelation are relatively “hot media” in that they
require a lot of input from the receiver to get the point. Incarnation is a “cold”
medium because everything transpires before the receiver’s eyes. In
Christ-to-us or in us-to-others, incarnation has less breakdown in
communication because explained example is clearer than explanation alone. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            For this same reason, love
is the manner and the message. Love is more than information; it surpasses
knowledge (Ephesians <b>3</b>:19). This fact means also that love transforms
knowledge itself into personalized content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul’s manner of presenting
Christian truth includes a tendency toward concretizing intangible,
transcendent matters. For example, he pictures transcendence as setting the mind
on the ascended Christ (Colossians <b>3</b>:1-4) and living the resurrected
life of Jesus (Romans <b>6</b>:1-14). Evangelism and teaching do not appeal
just to the intellect, but to the whole person and calls for involvement with
the Message. Jesus’ parables have that same tangible character. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We do not then so much <u>teach</u>
people as <u>influence</u> them. The paradigm (a) <i>adds interpersonal factors
to knowledge</i>, and (b) <i>qualifies the knowledge by</i> <i>interpersonal
elements</i>; and on occasion even (c) <i>replaces certain aspects of knowledge
with</i> <i>interpersonal factors</i> <i>by</i> <i>substituting ideas with
affections</i>. Evangelist and teachers make up for informational lack by supplying
attitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A kind of pre-evangelism must
take place to foster credibility. This stage is variously called lifestyle
evangelism, demonstration evangelism, presence evangelism. Peter says of this
matter, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“. . . wives, defer to your own husbands so that, even
if they do not obey the word, they may aside from the word be gained by the
behavior of their wives, watching your chaste manner of life coupled with
respect”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (1 Peter<b> 3</b>:1-2).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism implies
that the bulk of evangelism takes place through personal associations—through friends,
relatives, fellow workers, neighbors. Mass media, mailings, public mass
meetings help gain people’s attention, but the decisive work takes place one on
one. At least the one-on-one part must be there before the motivational
breakover, say, at mass meetings takes place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Evangelism is done by
persons, to persons, in interpersonal ways, to accomplish interpersonal results.
Missions, evangelism, education, apologetics, preaching, all participate in that
same interpersonal reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> VI. The Content of Evangelism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Christianity’s crucial
question is “What do you think about Messiah?” <i>“Do you believe that Jesus is
the Messiah, the Son of the Living God”</i> (Matthew <b>16</b>:16). Personal
and interpersonal considerations take central position. The contrast between
Christian and non-Christian religions lies at the level of the whole. Other
religions have aspects that are correct in themselves. Christianity is not a set
of ideas, beliefs, values, or behaviors. It is what and who Jesus Christ is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Syncretism poses a common
danger when the gospel confronts other religions. The impulse is to integrate
the new message into the old beliefs. But new wine cannot be put into old
wineskins, and Yahveh cannot be represented by a golden calf Exodus <b>32</b>:1-4).
Christianity forms a whole exclusive of all other parallel possibilities. New
information can often integrate into old information to form a larger whole. But
a person is a whole, an identity; Christ cannot become partially someone else;
identification with him cannot combine with something else. Jesus could not
become parallel to other aeons, for instance, in the larger fullness of the
Gnostic pleroma (Colossians <b>1-2</b>) without ceasing to be who he was and
without his “system” (interpersonalism) ceasing to be what it was. Jesus is not
simply a prophet dispensing knowledge; he <u>is</u> the whole message
personalized and incarnated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Christianity adopts
interpersonalism as its highest frame of reference. Other religions tend to put
ideas or law or kind of substance in ultimate position. What syncretism often
tries to do is find something <u>more</u> to supersede Christ by adding some
supposedly greater benefit than the restoration of relationship by removing guilt.
Sun Myung Moon afforded an example by claiming that Jesus had failed to provide
salvation, which God called Reverend Moon to secure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>VII. The Agents of Evangelism</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Evangelism involves the
character of the proclaimer involved in the proclaiming. Agents of ministry
cannot become professional in a way that makes their life quality irrelevant. Ministry
cannot devolve to methods, procedures, and skills of ministers. There is the
pre-evangelism noted above before there is proclamation and persuasion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Modeling accompanies
explaining because we are proclaiming a way of life that brings abundance by
relationship to a holy, loving God. Practicing one thing while preaching
another does not harmonize with the interpersonal message and its promises. We
first win the right to speak to people about the ultimate issues of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Proclaimers need to remove
detractors in their character (Matthew <b>5</b>:21-37) and to resist the
temptation to “hit back” (Matthew <b>5</b>:38-40). The goal is to make enemies ashamed
because they have <i>“nothing to accuse you of&quot; </i>(Titus <b>2</b>:8;
1Timothy <b>4</b>:12; Romans <b>12</b>:18). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

calls for doing good for people in times of change and need. People are more
receptive to stabilizing influence at unstable times like losing a job, moving,
kids’ leaving home, marriage failure, and the like. Influence returns good for
evil (Matthew <b>5</b>:40-42, 46-47; Romans<b> 12</b>:1) rather than
retaliating or avoiding. It wins people by godly living (1 Peter <b>3</b>:1-2; Acts<b>
2</b>:46-47; <b>5</b>:13-14a).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In stressing the character
of proclaimers, we do not want to undervalue proclamation. Presence evangelism wins
the right to proclaim, but it does not explain <u>why</u> we live as we do. When
righteousness creates readiness, proclamation can take over. Then believers can
testify what Christ means to them. They can describe the Christian message and
add persuasion to presence and proclamation. All these factors need to work
together as parts of one endeavor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Our frequent timidity about
speaking for Christ often comes from fear of rejection. We hesitate in part because
we and our listeners do not share a common basis of authority for life choices.
Some things can help. If we embody the life we call others to experience, we
can temporarily substitute <u>our own credibility</u> for the <u>Bible’s
credibility</u>. The second verse of the hymn “Make Me a Blessing” says, <i>“Others
will trust him if only you prove true every moment you live.”</i> Furthermore,
the gospel has <u>built-in credibility</u> that corresponds with hearers’ real
and felt needs. In that way its self-authenticating revelation aids the witness.
Common human experience can test the practical aspects of what we proclaim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Neither the administration
of “sacraments” nor the proclamation of good news requires authorized personnel
(“clergy”). Evangelism goes forward by a royal priesthood of all believers, not
by specialists. After Stephen’s martyrdom, those persecuted in Jerusalem and
Judaea went everywhere preaching the gospel (Acts<b> 8</b>:1, 4ff.). The record
gives no indication that they were sent or specially endowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As an indication of this natural
procedure, Wyn Arn, in studies connected with church growth, discovered that
75-90% of the converts in a typical congregation are introduced to Christ by
friends and relatives rather than by Christian professionals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Hearers will not so easily
misread a word for Christ spoken by lay people; they are not just “doing a
job.” Encounter <i>vs</i>. methodology means personal process <i>vs</i>. structured
program, and it is as ongoing as personal characteristics are. Lay evangelism
accentuates lifestyle as the visible embodiment of Christian concern.             </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In summary, as to method, evangelism
is not by coercing the <u>other</u>. As to manner and means, it is by
persuasion, which involves the character of the <u>proclaimer</u>. As to the
object, it requires a decision by the <u>hearer</u>.</span></p>
