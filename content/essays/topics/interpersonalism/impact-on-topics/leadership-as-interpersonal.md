<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Leading takes place in the
interpersonal circumstance and has the purpose of helping people grow in their
social skills necessary for getting the job done. Leadership is gained and
exercised by interpersonal means. In the church, leadership does not come by
heredity, force, being “pushy,” or by shortcutting, “riding in on another
person’s shirt tail,” or bypassing lesser roles through formal education. People
do not become leaders because they refuse to be involved otherwise—the “won’t-work-so-let-lead”
syndrome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Leadership is both earned
and given, but it needs to be earned to a significant degree before it is given
in any degree. Those who would serve as leaders must possess the skills appropriate
to the activity and the people involved in it. In the church that means knowing
scripture, people, and how to get things done. But most importantly, would-be
leaders in the church must evidence in their own person the moral qualities,
social skills, wholesome practices, and domestic situation appropriate to the
Christian endeavor they are trying to lead. Without that base for influence,
the words, techniques, and programs they employ will not produce what Christ
wants accomplished among his people (James <b>3</b>:1). People earn leadership
in Christ by first becoming the kinds of people Christ helps people become. The
bottom line in the church is the quality of social life. Only people who
possess it should—and will tend to—become leaders in the church. In fact,
legitimate leadership in any area requires personal character as the basis for the
rest of what is needed to be effective. Having everything else without that
character base does not result in lasting, effective Christian service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As a generalization, what
accentuates positive personality tends to accrue personal influence, and
influence is leadership. Influence is interpersonal as distinguished from
authority, which is legal, and from force, which is based on natural. We speak
here of matters beyond basic moral concerns—like initiative, positive attitude,
enthusiasm, tenacity, dependability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Receiving leadership refers
to the response of other people to our actions. Our actions represent <u>character</u>,
but <u>charisma</u> and <u>ethos</u> mean the impression we make on observers. Character
is what we have; charisma is what people see in us. That tendency toward
natural leadership may be formalized into <u>positions</u>. Formalizing
positions is what scripture means by “calling.” Since calling comes from
persons beyond us, receiving leadership formally as well as informally
constitutes an interpersonal process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The manner of exercising
leadership corresponds with the manner of obtaining it. As it is earned then
given, so it is by influence (natural leadership) before it is by responsibility
reinforced by authority (formal leadership). All the qualities developed and
used in gaining leadership remain in force while exercising it. Leading by
influence requires communication and demonstration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Leadership that stifles
persons must be avoided because it is not effective for what God wants. It is
foreign to how people operate. Leadership is responsibility for the welfare of
the group. Consequently, authoritarianism, economic duress, emotional
manipulation, and the like, do not belong in the process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In the exercise of
leadership, personal persuasion must precede impersonal authority. Paul’s
letter to Philemon illustrates forbearing to use authority in deference to
using influence so the recipient’s response can come from free will instead of compulsion.
Paul sought Onesimus’ manumission by personal influence rather than by
apostolic authority. Leaders do not appeal to authority until their influence
has been rejected. A correlation exists here with salvation in that judgment by
authority (holiness) comes after persuasion by influence (love) has been
rejected. This interpersonal atmosphere must surround and precede authority. It
will do so if leaders earn their position before receiving it and if natural
leaders are the ones given formal leadership.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The question about whether
there is authority in church offices can be solved by the subjective-objective
variable with persons. Objectively, supervisory authority resides in several
offices in the church—Lordship, apostleship, and eldership. Subjectively, the people
in those offices do not operate that way. For psychological purposes, it is
best to say that the authority resides in the office rather than in the person.
<i>Personal authority</i> is the confidence a leader can create in other people.
<i>Official authority</i> refers to their respect for the position. This analysis
turns on the variable between subjective attitude and objective circumstance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Self-centeredness represents
a non-interpersonal attitude and behavior pattern. In leadership and ministry,
egotism destroys. For example, a woman counselee sends cues to a minister that
he is a wonderful, helpful counselor. He picks up on those signals because he
tunes into what strokes his ego. Eventually his own marriage may suffer or be
ruined, and his capacity to minister may be lost (note, for example the classic
article, <i>Christianity Today</i>, “The Minister and the Other Woman,” August
l965).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Under interpersonalism also
belongs the effective-efficient variable so important in leadership. Authoritative
organization is often more efficient, but it is less effective; authority does
not readily foster the intrinsic motivation necessary for making self-starters.
Authority through organization becomes inefficient in the end because of
attrition and low morale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In Jesus’ post-resurrection
appearance, he asked Peter three times if he loved him. Each time Peter said “yes,”
the Lord told him to feed his sheep. The implication is that leadership
ministry arises out of love for the Lord and the sheep. <i>“You have to love me
before you are in a proper frame of mind to serve me and lead my sheep.”</i> </span></p>
