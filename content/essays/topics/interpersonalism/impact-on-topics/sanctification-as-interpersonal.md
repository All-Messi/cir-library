<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><b><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
possibility of spiritual growth (sanctification) comes from the nature of
interpersonal process. Under the perfection demand of law, becoming perfect
cannot occur after perfection is broken. But salvation before God deals with restoring
a personal relationship, which means that development toward maturity can
substitute for having already achieved it and always having to keep it. We can
deal with each other directionally (growth) rather than positionally
(perfection) because repentance-forgiveness can make up the difference between
performance and perfection. That fact is part of Paul’s contrast between faith <i>vs.</i>
works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            We
are willing to bear with people if <u>they are making progress</u> even though
their level of success is less than what we want. We “cut them some slack” for <u>proper
attitude</u>, <u>genuine concern</u>, and <u>repentance</u> in failure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Interpersonal
process occurs by influence, between persons, by degrees, over time, by
reciprocation, in wholeness. So fellowship is the natural place for our
development to take place. Sin has affected virtually every aspect of us and
our relations; so development occurs by the interaction of each part of us in
fellowship with other persons. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
interaction of <u>inner and outer</u> begins with the influences of other people
on us. The interaction of <u>need-answer-use</u> begins with other people who
in witnessing, missions, and teaching provide the answer by which the
unevangelized benefit from using the gospel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Putting
personal development in social interaction avoids the extremes of our doing it
all and God’s doing it all. The former brings frustration when we fail or pride
if we succeed. The latter causes waiting for success (quietism) or doubt if it
does not come. Interpersonalism combines both factors into one process through <u>reciprocation</u>
between persons—rather than God and us working in <u>parallel</u> to produce
different parts of the result. Under the interpersonal model, God gets the
credit if we succeed (because he is ultimate motivator), but we take the blame
if we fail. He supplements the process with him by the same kind of back and
forth operation we have with people. We might even say that he does his work
largely by delegation through the horizontal process between his people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
interpersonal context for sanctification fits with sin as ingrained habit
rather than inborn depraved being. Under inheritable depravity (a hypostatic
concept), sin comes from a <u>flaw</u> that a growing Christian needs God to remove
by a <u>miracle</u>, “regeneration” in theological parlance. Instead, our
reconstruction understands sin practice is <u>habit</u> broken by <u>motivation</u>
supplied by <u>influence</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Spiritual
exercises raise the level of God-consciousness, which creates stronger desire
for righteousness. The vertical spiritual exercises are <u>Bible reading</u>
and <u>prayer</u>; the horizontal exercises are <u>fellowship</u> with the
faithful and <u>service</u> to all mankind. Even the private exercises—<u>fasting</u>
and <u>meditation</u>—distance us from the material, impersonal aspects of life
and draw us nearer to the invisible God. Sanctification becomes a by-product of
upward and outward interaction between persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            For
best results, spiritual exercises must be “interpersonalized.” Fellowship and
service bring encouragement and fulfillment, which increase power in the
horizontal direction. In the vertical direction, prayer gives that same kind of
power. Devotional Bible reading has edification value, but it differs from
Bible study, which has educational value. Interpersonal Bible reading has
devotional purposes in mind, because it listens to God’s speaking to us. Fasting
can also be interpersonalized. Fasting does more than abstain from food; it
does so as a way of drawing near to God by drawing away from material existence
for a time. It gives transcendence over material existence by ascending to
divine association. Perhaps for this reason scripture usually combines fasting
with prayer. Bodily exercise profits little (or <u>a</u> little) regarding
spiritual things, but interpersonal activity strengthens us by drawing us
nearer to the other Person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Sanctification
occurs in the context of persons through influence rather than miracle. It dynamically
increases by degrees through reciprocal interaction between various sets of
poles—between inner and outer actions and between one person and another. Sanctification
is a continuous process over time rather than an instantaneous categorical
change. Since interpersonal process is reciprocal and holistic, it allows for
“becoming”; the “now” can become the “not-yet” (<i>What the Bible Says About
Salvation</i>, 78 ¶2, 211 ¶3). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Paul
compares the Law to a tutor that leads people to Christ. God used law as a steppingstone
to grace-faith (interpersonalism). The method he used across the history of his
people corresponds roughly to the stages of our development in life. Now that
Christ has come, we no longer need the legal tutor. Principled love replaces
legal regulations. Content-wise, legality does not contradict what post-conventional
behavior does, but the psychology of it is different. Full-grown people in
Christ live the way they do because of the way life really is rather than to
maintain an abstract standard of rules and regulations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Satan’s
question about Job relates to the stages of human development. Satan accused
the patriarch of serving God to curry favor: <i>“Does Job serve God for
nothing?” </i>(Job <b>1</b>:9). Additionally, he accused him of serving God in
a conventional mode—fear, rather than in a post-conventional mode—love: <i>“Everything
people have they will give for their life”</i> (Job <b>2</b>:4). Job’s
religious observance was immature according to Satan, but Job’s service to God
was a principled one: <i>“What? Will we receive good from God and not evil?”</i>
(<b>2</b>:10).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Interpersonalism
calls us to the highest developmental level: love, which has no limits; it will
not let us stay at law-and-order, rules-and-regulations, concrete-operational conventional
stages. </span></p>
