<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Faith belongs to the
interpersonal circumstance because it is something one person puts in another
person. Faith trusts in another. Scripture applies the faith principle to two
areas: salvation (consequences) and knowledge (information). In both
applications a second person stands in the gap (a) between the doer and the
result and (b) between the learner and what’s learned. Habakkuk <b>2</b>:4
serves as the gateway into the whole Christian system: <i>“The just will live
by faith/trust.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(a) In the <u>act-result</u>
application, believers rely on others to give what they do not themselves
produce. Faith does not eliminate action on the part of the believer; faith
itself is an act. Faith simply acknowledges that one’s own acts do not cause the
consequence. “Not caused by one’s own acts” could mean trusting the other
person simply to give the consequence. However, “not caused by one’s own acts”
can also mean trusting the other person to give what one’s own acts are merely conditions
for receiving. The character of such acts shifts from causes to conditions—conditions
for the input of the other party to give result completely (monergism as in
justification) or conditions for making up the difference between our own
efforts and the full expectancy (synergism as in sanctification; see “Salvation”).
Faith is trust in another, it is active relationship, and it is a degree matter
(2 Thessalonians <b>1</b>:3; 2 Corinthians<b> 10</b>:14b-15a) in keeping with
the fact that interpersonalism itself is subject to degrees and can grow with
time through experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(b) In the <u>knowledge</u>
application, the learner relies on another person for knowing things the
learner has not directly witnessed (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:6-8; Hebrews <b>1</b>:1),
whether of the past (Hebrews <b>11</b>:3), the future (Hebrews <b>11</b>:7),
the invisible (Hebrews <b>11</b>:27), or the present that lies outside our
direct experience. Sometimes faith is even preferrable to personal observation;
we trust the perception or interpretation of someone more competent to describe
and evaluate what we are watching as in relying on a referee’s call in a
basketball game we are watching—or even playing in!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Faith stands in
contrast to sight</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:7).
Consequently, it does not stand in contrast to knowledge as if the faith were
relative uncertainty and knowledge were certainty. Rather, faith is the
interpersonal <i>vs</i>. the personal way of knowing. Faith (trust) and sight (science)
are two ways to know. The certainty factor does not vary with this set, because
certainty depends on the trustworthiness of the other person in the one case
and the accuracy of personal perception in the other. So faith is not
uncertainty, a blind leap into the dark, gullibility, or living by impulse. Faith
involves relative certainty as all other finite knowledge does. (cp. the
document “Epistemology”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Faith comes from
response to personal influence</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>; it is
not a divine deposit in a passive soul. That would make the act of God a
person-to-thing act. Instead, faith comes by influence rather than miracle. Having
faith is not something done <u>to</u> us but <u>with</u> us. In its
interpersonal context, having faith involves <u>actions</u> taking place <u>between
persons</u> so that trust can grow by <u>degrees</u> over <u>time</u> through
the <u>give and take</u> of that association. When the Bible speaks of giving
faith it means giving those <u>experiences</u> that we can react to in faith or
giving the <u>opportunity</u> to have faith. When the disciples asked for
faith, Jesus responded with the mustard seed image (Luke <b>17</b>:5-10). If we
start with what we have, it will become by degrees what in the end can move
mountains. That means we must be doing; we must be responding to the divine
initiative that has already expressed itself toward us. Faith is not born full grown.
To develop it, we start doing something with someone, begin trusting
trustworthy persons. We trust a little that we may learn to trust more because we
find out in so doing that we are not betrayed. Talking to a young lady leads to
courtship, which leads to marriage, which leads to a whole life or trust
together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Furthermore, <u>faith
is not mind over matter</u>. Faith is not believing something strongly enough
to make it happen. Faith as mind over matter reduces faith from an
interpersonal act to something done wholly by the self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Everyone lives by
faith</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:7). It
is not that Christians live by faith and others do not; the only question is
who we trust. We are all hopelessly interpersonal, un-omniscient, and
un-omnipotent; and we are so because of the very essence of what makes us in
the image of God—the interpersonal capacity in people who die. Faith allows us
to access the resources in others, the resources from the future, and even our
own resources more efficiently. We might not even try to do what we can do if
it were not for the encouragement of others who may not even be helping us succeed.
We must live by faith because the structure of our existence requires it: we cannot
even buy gas without trusting the company (to provide proper fuel) and the company’s
trusting us (to pay for it).</span></p>
