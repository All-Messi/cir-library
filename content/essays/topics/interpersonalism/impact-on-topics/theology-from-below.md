<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.25in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>            Isaiah
declares that a wayfaring fool need not err in the way of the Lord (<b>35</b>:8).
We, being evil, know how to give good gifts to our children (Matthew <b>7</b>:11
= Luke <b>11</b>:13). Jesus’ comment is a cue and clue that the way of the Lord
is not that hard. At least the basics of revelation we ought to catch onto from
personal experience as we <i>“feel after God to find him”</i> because <i>“he is
not far from every one of us”</i> (Acts <b>17</b>:27).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.25in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>            So
much of what our creator is interested in has to do with proper personal
relationship to him and other people. Though interpersonal relationships are
the most complex realities we know of, we understand how they work because we
are involved in them all the time. It is most likely the capacity referred to
when scripture says we are created in God’s image, the interpersonal capacity. If
we have a problem in such matters, it is not so much in understanding what is
appropriate to do but in doing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.25in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>            Working
upward from our own nature and circumstance, we ought to understand how God
operates and what he expects of us. We read off of his image created into us
what interpersonal deity is like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.25in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>            Derivative
implications relate even to such matters as how we present doctrinal
matters—that we do so in behavioral garb. It is not just a matter of wholeness
(<i>vs</i>. bifurcation), but of direction. Not only do we mix the conceptual <u>and</u>
the experiential, we go from the experiential <u>to</u> the conceptual. Learner
can see the pattern in the experience. All they need to do is extract the
pattern and apply it in like situations. That process is akin to “theological
interprestation,” where what is said in one connection in scripture is lifted
from its original setting and applied to other like situations. That procedure
is evidently one reason Jesus taught in parables.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.25in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>            Theology
from below corresponds with the educational concept of readiness—starting with
where “students” are and leading them to where they need to be. Jesus applied
that principle when he told his disciples, <i>“You cannot bear them now”</i> (John
<b>16</b>:12). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.25in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>            Theology
from below is the reason the Golden Rule (<i>a la</i> The Second Great
Commandment) works so well in guiding positive social interaction. It assumes
the fundamental <u>unity of mankind</u> so that “I” can project my
consciousness over behind the eyes of “you” and, for the most part, understand
what “I” should do. It gives us a “rule of thumb” to operate by. (We can do the
Golden Rule because of the <i>imago dei</i>.) We need to look at it from the
“you” perspective because of the <u>difference</u> between “I” and “you,”
either in the <u>circumstances</u> the other person is in or the <u>difference
of understanding </u>in him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.25in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>            The
warning is that we, being evil, need to take heed that our <u>viewpoint of
consciousness</u> not degenerate into <u>self-centeredness</u>. We can be
tempted to do that by (1) forgetting that God <u>knows our hearts</u> (Luke <b>16</b>:15;
1 Samuel <b>16</b>:7; Proverbs <b>21</b>:2; Romans<b> 8</b>:26). We cannot hide
our <u>motives</u> and <u>attitudes</u> from him. There are no short-cuts by
way of ritual or external behavior when our “hearts are not in it.” We cannot
manipulate God or use manipulative techniques on other people, because over
time even people will catch on. We cannot get by <u>substituting</u> something
else, something easier, for the naturally required thing.</p>
