<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Both vertical and
horizontal relationships have the same interpersonal character. Experiencing
the horizontal helps us understand the vertical; understanding the vertical
motivates us to do the horizontal. In both directions, love is the
characterizing feature. It includes most aspects of interpersonal associations
and originates so many of the virtues involved in them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Love </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>is accomplished by the mechanism implicit in the
Golden Rule (Matthew <b>7</b>:12), which restates the Second Great Commandment
(Leviticus <b>19</b>:18). <i>“<u>Doing / for others / as you would</u> <u>have
others do for you</u>”</i> parallels <i>“<u>Love / your neighbor / as yourself</u>.”</i>
That means love is something we “do” rather than something we feel or say. Love
is a pattern of doing—self-giving for the joy of “others” without qualification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Neighbor”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> in the Second Great Commandment was not a restrictive
or contrasting term, but as a positive reference to someone considered close. The
nature of personal relationship removes any distinction in worth between people
of different races (Luke <b>10</b>:25-37), societal statuses, economic levels,
sex, age, or even between one person and a personal enemy (Matthew <b>5</b>:43-48).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“As yourself”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> contrasts with impersonal ways of treating other
people. It negates <u>manipulating</u> them by doing “so” they will do for us. It
negates <u>not taking initiate</u> or doing only “because” others have done for
us. It sets aside the <u>conditional love</u> of doing “if” others do for us. It
overrides <u>retaliation</u> for doing “what” others have done to us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>To love, we must
project consciousness from behind our own eyes to behind the eyes of the other.
We cannot simply ask what we would want done for us because people are not the
same. Projecting consciousness enables the socialization process, which turns
individuals into social beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Love by projecting
consciousness requires us to take the initiative; so we do good in return even
for evil, because other people need that regardless of how they themselves have
acted. Taking initiative represents a healthy trait that improves self-image,
but it also enables us to reverse the downward spiral of deteriorating relationship
that issues from revenge. Doing good in return for evil illustrates love at its
most mature level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Love as expressive of
proper relationship requires that neither person is reduced to zero. Manipulating
others through force, anger, emotion, money does not retain them as
individuals. Letting people run over us means letting them manipulate us and
reduce us to zero. In either case the process ceases to be interpersonal. People
must love their neighbors as themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Love as interpersonal
action replaces the competition model with the cooperation model. The goal is
to affirm the other person, to bring joy through self-giving, to establish an
atmosphere of mutual respect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Love produces a number
of results present in social relations. On the basis of 1 Corinthians <b>13</b>:1-8,
we can say that love gives real and perceived meaning to our conversation, our
abilities, and our activities (<b>1-3</b>). That meaningfulness comes because,
being interpersonalized, our various actions come into positive contact with
other people, which gives <u>meaningfulne</u>ss by way of relevance to persons.
Love contributes a host of other personal qualities necessary for smooth
personal interaction: patience, the lack of envy and pride (4), sensitivity to
the wants and preferences of other people, the absence of selfishness, the
presence of self-control, forgiveness (5), honesty (6), strength, trust, a
positive outlook, steadfastness (7), and endurance (8). Love eliminates
self-centeredness and competition, and replaces them with qualities that make
for friendship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Love puts people ahead
of pleasure, possessions, goals, selfish concerns, power, or ideas. Love
develops in interpersonal circumstances because it is interpersonal. So, to be
loving, we put ourselves around loving people and imitate what they do. We treat
everyone the way we treat our friends as a way of learning to love our enemies.</span></p>
