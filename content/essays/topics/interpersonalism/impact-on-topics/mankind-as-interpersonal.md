<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> I. Interpersonalism applies first to
mankind as an explanation of God’s purpose. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Humankind is “for the praise
of the glory of God’s grace” (Ephesians<b> 1</b>:6; cp. 12, 14). Both “praise”
and “grace” apply to social activity. Praise is response to grace. What God
first gave from his grace we praise him for in our response. Both God and people
give and receive. God gives to people in his grace and receives praise and
honor. We get from grace and give in praise. Since the phenomenon consists of
two-directional action between persons, from an (a) <u>existential standpoint</u>
the purpose of people itself is interpersonal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            From a more (b) <u>eschatological
standpoint</u>, Acts <b>17</b>:26-27 speaks of God’s making <i>“of one </i>nature]
<i>every nation of men . . . that they might feel after him and find him.”</i> The
forward thrust of human efforts (eschatological) issues in relationship
(existential) even as relationship issues in purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> II. Interpersonalism speaks also to the
very nature of man. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Out of the interpersonal
nature of God as gracious comes the purpose of God to create that whereon he
can bestow grace (Ephesians<b> 1</b>:6). Out of the purpose of God arises the nature
of man, whom he creates in his own image. That image consists of the
interpersonal capacity that enables people to relate back to God in the way God
first related to him. George Herbert Meade among others observed that we
individually become persons by functioning relationally with other persons. God
first communicates to us through creation itself as well as through special
revelation; we reciprocate by praising God’s previous grace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonal relationship
is the characterizing reality in Christian truth. Nowhere has this observation
appeared more relevant than in the study of our race. Over the centuries
extensive thought has gone into the interpretation of Genesis<b> 1</b>:26-27
and related materials: <i>“Let’s make mankind in our image after our likeness.”</i>
Traditionally there have been four proposed aspects of the “image of God.” <u>Reason</u>
has headed the list. The ability to think abstractly relates to the capacity
for language, creativity, self-transcendence, responsibility (dominion), and
even humor. People can penetrate a situation in thought and imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Emotion</u> distinguishes
us from much of the created realm because we can care, have feelings,
experience affection for other persons. <u>Will</u> enables us to choose
between alternatives. So we are not limited to a stimulus-response existence
where response answers the strongest stimulus in the environment. We also have
a <u>spirit</u>—the aspect that transcends the flesh and continues after the
death of the body. Traditionally, then, we have been regarded as created in God’s
image because we have rational, emotional, volitional, and spiritual
capacities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            While these proposals about
the image offer significant insight into our nature, Genesis <b>1</b>:26-27
suggests a more inclusive truth connected to interpersonalism. First is the
pronoun <i>us</i>.<i> “Let us make mankind in our image” </i>draws attention to
the interpersonal character of God himself. “Us” refers to the three-person
oneness of God. It is not majestic plural, since later in the account <b>3</b>:22
says “<u>one of</u> us.” “Majestic plural” refers to using plurality for great
degree—in this case the greatness of God. But there could not be “one of” such
a plurality: “Man has become like one of us.” An alternate interpretation takes
“us” to mean God and the celestial beings. But angels do not appear in the
context so as to be the antecedent of a pronoun. The word for “angel” is not
used at all until Genesis <b>16</b>:7. Furthermore, we are said to be created
in the image and likeness of <u>God</u>, not only here but elsewhere in
scripture (Genesis <b>5</b>:1; <b>9</b>:6; 1 Corinthians<b> 11</b>:7; James <b>3</b>:9;
cp. Acts <b>17</b>:28-29). Such phraseology does not occur with angels. So “us”
indicates the interpersonal character of God. Since we bear the image of that
interpersonal God, the image of God in us means primarily our interpersonal
character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A second observation that
highlights our interpersonal character comes from the parallelism in Genesis <b>1</b>:27.
<i>“In the image of God he created man”</i> stands parallel to <i>“male and
female he created them.”</i> The image evidently pertains to what is common to the
male-female nature of humanness. Since God is spirit, physical sexuality is not
the point even though marriage does provide our closest, most permanent, and
all-inclusive personal experience. Marriage has the character that it does
primarily because in it we most distinctively demonstrate the intense,
permanent, and all-inclusive oneness of the godhead. The plurality-in-oneness
of marriage is <u>analogous</u> to the plurality-in-oneness of trinity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Of special importance
regarding marriage is that its interpersonal character precedes its physical
distinctive. Not until there is compenetration of personhood can there
naturally be compenetration of physical natures. Marriage is mutual commitment
and common identity of persons before it is participation in sexual
relationship. Sexual relation is communication before it is pleasure and
procreation; mankind can reproduce face to face. So the relevance of image to
male-female lies, not directly in the physical domain, but contextually in its
interpersonal setting. Physical relationship occurs in interpersonal
relationship, and physical relationship uniquely bonds interpersonal identity between
husband and wife. As a result, analogy to the trinity teaches us about the
divine intent in marriage as an interpersonal experience, and the interpersonal
marriage experience helps us comprehend the nature of the divine trinity in
whose image human persons are created. So the image of God in us lies at the
corporate as well as the individual level. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The individual capacities
traditionally cited do have a place in the image, not because they are the
image, but because they make the image possible. Reason, emotion, will, spirit
are capacities for operating interpersonally. In this way they distinguish us
from animal and compare us to God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Several advantages come from
putting the <i>imago dei</i> at the level of interpersonal capacity. For one
thing, it (1) <u>fosters wholeness</u>. A person is not reduced to one essence—like
rationality, nor fragmented into a series of parts—reason, will, choice, spirit.
Our wholeness in God’s image involves even the physical body so as not to
create unnatural division between body and spirit or to depreciate the physical
aspect of the total self; the image include the body by analogy. The socio-physical
unity in marriage bears analogy to the socio-spiritual unity in
Father-Son-Spirit (note implications of 1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:17).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The image as interpersonal
capacity (2) <u>clarifies the man-animal distinction</u>. No animal is said to
be created in God’s image. Man found no mate in the animal kingdom (Genesis<b>
2</b>:18-20). Animals could be killed but not mankind (Genesis<b> 9</b>:6). Cohabitation
between mankind and animal called for capital punishment (Leviticus<b> 20</b>:15).
To be distinguished from animal, mankind does not have to be unique in every
respect nor absolutely unique in any one respect. Rather, the <u>degree</u> to
which we possess these abilities is sufficiently greater that in combination
they produce our uniqueness—the interpersonal capacity. Our uniqueness from
animals is not qualified by rudimentary intelligence seen in crude tool making
(<i>vs</i>. just tool using) or perhaps in elementary language learning—which
has not actually been demonstrated despite claims to that effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The image as interpersonal
capacity (3) <u>provides theological foundation for interpreting sexuality</u>.
It affirms the equal worth of both sexes (Galatians <b>3</b>:28) and defines
the proper relationship between them (1 Corinthians <b>6</b>:13-20). Sexual difference
is subsumed under the divine image common to both and expressed in the union of
the two (Genesis <b>2</b>:24). The dignity of marriage, nevertheless,
harmonizes with the wholeness of personhood in the unmarried, because the
interpersonal capacity accentuated in marriage finds expression in all other
social relations as well. The total, permanent, exclusive identity of
husband-wife is reminiscent of the Father-Son-Spirit. In his own image God
created them male and female.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            People are persons before
they are male or female persons. God has personhood without sexuality. Being
persons before we are sexual persons is not only illustrated in the
non-sexuality of personal deity and angelic personhood; it appears in the
pre-puberty aspect of life, where it does not significantly differentiate modes
of personhood. The same commonality returns in the maturity of senior years. Chronological
order (God before adult and childhood before puberty) mirrors logical order in
the history of things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Placing personhood ahead of
sexuality means that we have access to the prime personal capacity—love. Love
provides a basis for the experience of meaningfulness and personal worth that
stands alternative to competition. One plague in modern Western culture is
people’s discomfort with sexuality. It results in homosexuality, unisex,
cohabitation, sexual abuse, which represent disorientation within individual
persons. They have not integrated themselves fully and are attempting to
rationalize perverted ways of not having to face that lack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Unisex results from the
death of absolutes and the denial of antitheses, which establish contrast and
difference. People want to deny antitheses because they do not know how to
obtain meaningfulness aside from competition, in which by the nature of the
situation most people do not fare well—they do not “win.” Obscuring differences
attempts to avoid failures and therefore meaninglessness in the arena of
competition. They cannot readily handle unity amidst diversity. They could,
however, choose complementariness rather than attempt to eliminate difference. In
other words, interpersonalism via love provides the means and goal alternative
to competition and loss of uniqueness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <i>imago dei</i> as
interpersonal capacity (4) <u>connects the natural and ethical usages of the “image
of God” expression</u> (Genesis<b> 1</b>:26; <b>5</b>:1; <b>9</b>:6; 1
Corinthians <b>11</b>:7; James<b> 3</b>:9 <i>vs</i>. [Romans<b> 8</b>:29?]; 2 Corinthians
<b>3</b>:18; Colossians <b>3</b>:10). Not only were we created in the image of
God; we are redeemed from being sinners to “put on the new man that is being
renewed to knowledge after the image” of our creator (Colossians <b>3</b>:10). Ethics
and morality apply only to interpersonal circumstances. The natural image
amounts to the interpersonal capacity; the ethical image amounts to proper
interpersonal behavior. The use of “image” to mean ethical character confirms
our understanding of the image as interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism gives
fundamental definition to biblical anthropology inasmuch as we are created in
the image of God. <i>Imago dei </i>as interpersonal capacity, explains why
being “alone” is not good (Genesis <b>2</b>:18): we are relational beings. Because
interpersonal relationship is our defining mark, we acknowledge no superiority
of worth among human subsets either in regard to sex, race, or social status. We
all share the elemental capacity that makes us what we are—we have
interpersonal capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Mind helps us function interpersonally.
It enables us to receive word revelation from personal deity. It enables us to
live by revealed values rather than genetic instinct, innate drive, chemical
response, conditioned reflex, or trained habit. It gives us self-transcendence
so we can experience transcendent (John <b>3</b>:3-8; 1 Corinthians<b> 15</b>:50;
Romans <b>12</b>:2), crucified living (Galatians <b>2</b>:20; <b>5</b>:24; <b>6</b>:14),
the resurrected lifestyle (Romans<b> 6</b>:2b-13; <b>8</b>:11; 1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:33-34),
the ascended lifestyle (Colossians<b> 3</b>:1-5; Philippians <b>3</b>:17-21). We
can “get out of ourselves” for other people. Mind gives orientation to
emotions, boundaries to drives, direction to will, and guidelines for
conscience. It enables us to relate socially by projecting consciousness over behind
the eyes of another. It enables us to reorganize reality and live by the
internal world we create.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Identifying the
interpersonal capacity as the image of God (5) <u>involves us in seeing mankind
as society</u>. It makes sensible the normal use of trinitarianism as a model
for society. Traditionally trinity has supplied the characteristics for the
relational category, which applies most fully to persons in relationship. The
principal factors are <u>unity</u> (oneness, homoousia—same substance,
relatedness), <u>diversity</u> (individuality, distinction, contrast,
difference), and <u>equality</u> (commonality, mutuality, compenetration,
impartiality, interdependence, co-importance, equally essential to the whole). Since
people are created in God’s image, what applies to the trinity in these matters
applies to people relationally—in marriage and in society as a whole, epitomized
in the family. The points made in this entry have appeared in many places, one
being Paul T. Arveson’s article “A Relational Analysis of Social Groups” in the
December 1987 issue of <i>Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation</i>,
pp. 190-197.</span></p>
