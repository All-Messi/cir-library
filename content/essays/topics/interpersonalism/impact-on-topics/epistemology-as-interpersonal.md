<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We walk by faith, not
by sight (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:7). Faith and sight are two ways to know. Sight
means knowledge by direct perception; faith is knowledge through the testimony
of other people. We know about the past, the future, the distant, and the
invisible only by testimony, if at all. In short, most knowledge comes from
revelation either by God or some other person. In either case, it is
interpersonal—by faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The certainty of
knowledge depends on the trustworthiness of the one who mediates it to us in
the case of faith and on the reliability of sensors (or extensions of them) in
the case of sight. Real-world matters (physical) do not involve the absolute
certainty possible in logical relationships and functions like 2 x 2 = 4
(metaphysical). But the relative ambiguity of the human situation that results
from that fact about existence, does not destroy operating in the world. We do
not have to have absolute certainty or precise knowledge; we only need relative
certainty of sufficient accuracy to operate in the human circumstance, to
experience fulfillment, to glorify God, to bring joy to other people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Knowledge comes from
experience as to content (empiricism, nurture), while the forms that contain it
come by creation and birth (rationalism, nature). As to content, knowledge
derives from rational deduction or personal experience. There is a certain
amount of innate knowledge (at least the “forms” of knowledge, which make
possible the deep structure necessary for language and reasoning)—something
comparable to instincts like how to nurse. Most knowledge, however, comes
interpersonally; so epistemology must be figured interpersonally through
revelation rather than by anamnesis (recollection from previous incarnations or
innate knowledge) or supernatural illumination—direct deposit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Keeping things in
balance we may find difficult. Interpersonalism has the pattern of balance. What
occurs in concepts that tend away from each other (unity and truth, <i>e.g</i>.)
can be balanced in reality—especially in interpersonal reality—because attitude
can bring together disparate entities. That is particularly true when a person
is viewing a process. Interpersonal relationship reinforces our ability to
think clearly.</span></p>
