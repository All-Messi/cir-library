.5in;line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“He
is a friend of God.” </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That
is about the best thing a person can say about someone. In the mouth of God
himself, Isaiah says, <i>“Abraham my friend”</i> (Isaiah <b>41</b>:8; cp. James
<b>2</b>:23; 2 Chronicles <b>20</b>:7). In scripture, friendship implies
several things about relationship to God. Jesus tells us what he is doing: <u>revelation</u>
(John <b>15</b>:15); so <i>friends</i> better describes us than <i>slaves</i>
or <i>servants</i> does. Besides, he <u>cares about us</u>—a lot, enough even
to die voluntarily an excruciating death for us (John <b>15</b>:13-15; Romans <b>5</b>:6-8,
<i>etc</i>.). That implies doing for us whatever else we really need and cannot
do for ourselves; that is what a friend does (Romans <b>8</b>:32; 1 John <b>3</b>:17).
Friendship with God separates us from people that are at cross purposes with
him: <i>“Friendship with the world is enmity with God”</i> (James <b>4</b>:4; 1
John <b>2</b>:15); so <u>we have the same values and purposes</u> that he does.
Experience tells us what ideal friendship is like and how it operates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Friends
of God”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
is a simple expression for positive, active personal relationship. As such, it participates
in a broad set of biblical data that describe the nature and purpose of the Judaeo-Christian
faith. Interpersonalism serves as the integrating reality for Christian truth. The
bases for that claim stem from observations like the following: personal
relationship characterizes <u>what is most original</u> in time and <u>what is
most ultimate</u> in kind of reality. God is the “us” who created heaven and
earth from nothing and as distinct from himself (Genesis <b>1</b>:1 + 26; <b>3</b>:22;<b>
11</b>:7; cp. John <b>14</b>:16). He created the “us” of mankind in his own
image (Genesis <b>1</b>:26, <i>etc</i>.), which implies that the <i>imago dei</i>
is the interpersonal capacity. That correlation in kind of being enables
friendship between God and mankind. <u>What is most eternal</u> is likewise
interpersonal (1 Corinthians <b>13</b>:13) as is <u>what is most inclusive</u>
(Mark <b>12</b>:28-34).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
<u>central vocabular</u>y of apostolic teaching addresses social behaviors: <i>love</i>,
<i>grace/faith</i>, <i>promise</i>, <i>alienation/reconciliation</i>, <i>repentance/forgiveness</i>,
and similar terms. The <u>fruit of the spirit</u> has interpersonal character:
love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, and the like (Galatians <b>5</b>:22-23
and elsewhere). All the <u>great summaries of the faith</u> are interpersonal: the
First Great Commandment (love God), the Second Great Commandment = Royal Law =
The Golden Rule (love fellowman), and Micah <b>6</b>:8 (<i>“What does Yahveh
require of you, but to do justly, love kindness, and walk humbly with your
God?”</i>; cp. Deuteronomy <b>30</b>:15). <u>Guaranteed blessings</u> during
this life stem from positive, active association with God, his Messiah, and his
people (Matthew <b>5</b>:2-12, and other texts). These <u>central features</u>
of the faith contrast with what are less central (supernatural gifts, <i>e.g</i>.,
as in 1 Corinthians <b>12</b>:31-<b>13</b>:13) or foreign to Christian concerns
(wealth, diet, race, gender, social status). We wonder whether scripture
teaches much about the scientific nature of the universe and things in it
except insofar as they have implications for behavior between persons. For
example, scripture gives commands, which imply volition to obey them; but it
does not explain what in the human central nervous system, hormonal systems, or
chemical processes makes choosing possible. It proscribes homosexual,
adulterous, incestuous (by extension, pedophilic) behaviors without explaining
why people experience these disorienting propensities. We accept those
proscriptions in accepting Christ’s friendship and lordship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Observations
so far are not subject to dispute. The important point is that interpersonalism
is the fundamental reality and all other kinds of things are secondary to it. Beyond
those <u>primary proofs</u> that lead to it, the truth and value of
interpersonalism finds <u>confirmatory evidence</u> in what issues from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><span

Values</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Positive
interpersonal behavior provides a unifying field of knowledge, a relevant basis
for theology, a worldview, the big picture, topical understanding at all levels.
It establishes the ultimate frame of reference, the hermeneutical programmatic,
the starting point that contextualizes specifics. It sets the category for
systematics and theological method by requiring a paradigm shift from
impersonal thinking. Impersonal systems exist, and they can operate even in
conjunction with interpersonal process, but they are secondary and subsequent to
it and participate in a way that does not vitiate the former, more basic
reality (much as law was added to gospel without annulling gospel (Galatians <b>3</b>:17-19).
Intuitive analysis identifies other systems: (a) <u>law</u>, which causes its
effects by authority; (b) <u>hypostasis</u>, which causes its effects by force;
and (c) <u>metaphysics</u>, which goes forward by form. They accomplish their
results differently than does <u>interpersonalism</u>, which fosters effects by
influence. Their effects come deterministically; friendship’s effects come
tendentially (choice creating “slippage” on both sides of relationships). There
can be only one ultimate universal eternal system, which overrides all parallel
possibilities. Friendship affords a down-to-earth, shorthand approach to <u>establishing
and using the Christian worldview</u>; it sets the <u>concern of Christian
faith</u> (purpose) and the <u>character of things</u> relevant to it (nature).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:

About Topics</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            If
friendship with God and his people represents the concern of Christianity,
Christ’s followers can thereby evaluate what is relevant, foreign, and
antithetical to it. They can differentiate items of <u>faith</u> (what is
relevant), <u>fact</u> (what is true but without behavioral correlates), and <u>opinion</u>
(what lacks sufficient evidence for a conclusion). By contemplating friendship,
God’s people can classify what is <u>central</u> and <u>less central</u>, <u>moral
law</u> (what derives from the nature of personal relationships) <i>vs.</i> <u>positive
commandment</u> (a specified way of doing what could be done variously), <u>advice</u>
(what involves risk if not done) <i>vs.</i> <u>commandment</u> (what involves
disobedience if not done), and evaluate the <u>relative importance</u>, say, of
form and content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
Law of the Harvest stresses the continuity of kind between cause and effect. People
do not gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles (Matthew <b>7</b>:16-19;
<b>12</b>:33-35; Luke <b>6</b>:43-45); those who sow to the flesh reap
corruption; those who sow to the spirit reap eternal life (Galatians <b>6</b>:6-9).
The nature of the system corresponds with the nature of the results that come from
it; conversely, the nature of the result corresponds with the nature of the
system that produces it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
interpersonal “category” sets expectancy for what doctrines and practices
people should observe. Every deviation in Christian thought and practice has
been some kind of departure from the interpersonal category. When the gospel
hit the Gentle territories, it conflicted with the hypostatic interests of that
milieu (Gnosticism, Stoicism, Epicureanism, Platonism, Greek dualism), and the contemporary
Judaism that fostered legal and nationalistic thinking (Judaizer, <i>e.g</i>.;
1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:22-24). In time, Augustine was particularly instrumental
in systematically importing hypostatic thinking into mainstream Christendom. Later
John Calvin crystalized legal process in systematic theology. In our own day,
interest in science predominates with its implicit assumption that there is a
one-to-one correspondence between being and behavior (something of a return to
Greek philosophy).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Several
doctrines exhibit the widespread distortions caused by ontology and legality as
departures from the interpersonal perspective. Augustine abandoned the
Manichees’ notion that evil (and good) is a <u>substance</u>. To provide a coherent
analysis of evil, he postulated instead that evil is a deprivation in the <u>form
of substance</u> relative to its pristine condition. Applying that concept to
mankind, he theorized that consequent to Adam’s sin mankind incurred depravity
(original sin) in such a way that it passed onto all humans because they all
descended from the one. Several soteriological inferences followed. It paved
the way for supernaturalizing aspects of the salvation process. Total
depravity—the idea that inherited sin substantively affects every aspect of
every person—meant that each individual had to be supernaturally <u>regenerated</u>
before conversion could happen (including baptismal regeneration). Later came
Wesley’s idea that a <u>second definite work of grace</u> eradicated the last
vestiges of inbred sin so the Christian could live a perfect life of love.
Irresistible grace came to those God elected to save. Hypostasis also underlies
some proposals for guaranteeing the <u>perseverance of the saints</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
natural depravity concept generated other ideas like the immaculate conception
of Mary—that she was born without original sin so her Son could be born without
the taint of Adamic sin. The virgin birth supposedly took place because the
depravitizing element was carried particularly by the male. Hypostatic
inferences issued in certain beliefs about sexuality and marriage. The
perpetual virginity of Mary is at best not taught in scripture, but in a Stoic
direction virginity represented a higher level of goodness, which was
appropriate for her as “deity bearer” (<i>theotokos</i>). Likewise came the
prioritizing of celibacy and even celibacy in marriage from the time of
conversion. The celibacy of the priesthood rests on this idea, as well as
flagellation, monasticism, and asceticism. Sex for procreation always/only (together
with prohibiting contraceptives) represents another nonbiblical teaching that depreciates
<u>bodily drives</u> as themselves less ideal if not evil—instead of evil pertaining
to the <u>manner of fulfilling bodily drives</u>. The various doctrines of real
presence (transubstantiation, metousiosis, consubstantiation, impanation) in
the Eucharist have no apt basis except for substantive thinking. Hypostasis via
depravity impacts exegesis by requiring supernatural aid to understand
revelation (when what is needed is the interpersonal starting point).
Occasionalism in interpretation extends that idea—that the Spirit of God
reveals <u>parallel to</u> the word rather than <u>through</u> the word. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Legality,
by itself and in combination with depravity, brings in a plethora of doctrines
including a couple of those in the center of the TULIP (<u>t</u>otal depravity,
<u>u</u>nconditional election, <u>l</u>imited atonement, <u>i</u>rresistible
grace, <u>p</u>erseverance of the saints). Unconditional election and limited
atonement are legal concepts inasmuch as they rest wholly in the sovereign authority
of God. Such beliefs tend toward quietism and fatalism. Other doctrines and
practices include sacraments as automatic flow of grace, clerical absolution, official
administration of sacraments, the idea that grace flows through church, the
concept of original guilt—that all the members of the race as such are guilty
to spiritual death for the sin committed by another: Adam. Consequently,
legality underlies the efficacy of infant baptism and belief in a need for it;
the same applies to baptism for the dead. (Personal relationships, however,
cannot be established by law or proxies.) Legality fostered delayed baptism to
avoid the perceived problem of postbaptismal sins—as if baptism were associated
with salvation from sins rather than salvation from sin (an alienated circumstance/a
relationship matter). That in turn led to the problem with “clinici”
(unbaptized believers in a death-bed condition), which in turn bled off into the
issue about the form of baptism (pouring water on them since they could not
readily be immersed). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Interpersonalism
establishes appropriate alternatives to all these substantive and legal concepts.
It shows what salvation is—reconciliation to friendship after alienation caused
by personal behavior inappropriate to personal relationship/friendship; how
salvation is both permanent and reversible—intention <i>vs.</i> fulfillment of
intent; how neither perfection nor antinomianism obtains; how human response is
both necessary and not efficient or sufficient; why people cannot save
themselves—forgiveness unto fellowship being always pronounced by the party
offended by the behavior of the other; how Christ is our savior—as the only
sinless One, whom the Father appointed for us to identify with as an appropriate
condition for his regard us as sinless like him; how salvation is both
universal and limited—universal offer plus limited acceptance; how salvation
continues—by the same principles by which it comes; what assurance of salvation
is like (based on trust <i>vs</i>. legally irreversible).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:

Texts</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            With
the interpersonal framework in place, interpretation can proceed more
profitably. Without that systematic context, an interpreter must establish
doctrinal understanding by terms and texts alone, which often turns out to be a
misuse of “proof texts” and over-reliance on word meanings. Unresolvable
disagreement can come from the purely exegetical approach, because words and
phrases can be understood in more than one way when taken by themselves. The
previously established interpersonal context, however, helps sort through those
problems by (a) <u>eliminating interpretations that are foreign to that interpersonal
context</u>. If legal and hypostatic procedures cannot be established—whether
as general constructs or with relevance to specific topics, there is no revealed
basis for bringing them and their implications into the discussion of any topic.
Doctrines based on those irrelevant processes fall away on their own as <u>un</u>proved;
they need not be <u>dis</u>proved, because they fail to shoulder their own (b) <u>positive
burden of proof</u>. The interpersonal context helps (c) <u>sort analogy from
reality</u> as the intended referent of comparisons like metaphors, parables,
metonymies, poetic expression, approximate pictures. That is due in part to the
practice of using the same terms for (d) functional equivalents between systems
(“death” for spiritual death as alienation; legal terms from Mosaism applied to
interpersonal realities in Christian faith—Christ’s death as sacrifice).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Consequently,
terms, phrases, and passages do not mean just anything and everything they
could mean, but only what is contextually relevant, including especially what
is relevant to the largest context—positive interpersonal nature, process, and
result. In exegetical work, the interpersonal principle enables a student of
scripture to get behind foreign and false meanings. Specific texts presumably have
established the general interpersonal framework; that framework then clarifies specific
texts unclear or indefinite by themselves aside from that framework; their combined
content elaborates the general perspective. In that way, there arises an
accumulating interaction between specific verses and general topics and other
specific verses so there can be growth in understanding by way of an
accumulating content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            If
indeed legal procedure is <u>dis</u>proved and hypostatic presuppositions are <u>un</u>proved,
then the exegetical enterprise can proceed unhindered by the distractions and
perversions that those foreign categories have historically brought into
Christian understanding and practice.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
summary, friendship with God <u>clarifies</u> what would otherwise be ambiguous
with no meaning or with multiple meanings. Friendship <u>simplifies</u> even
though interpersonal relationships are themselves the most complex reality we
know. We already understand friendship because of extensive experience with it on
both sides of social interaction. So, interpersonalism fulfills the biblical
criterion for the way of the Lord as something a wayfaring fool need not err in
(Isaiah <b>35</b>:8). Truth itself is simple; what is difficult comes in not confusing
it with artificial lookalikes. Friendship <u>unifies</u> by providing a holistic
context. It <u>nuances</u> the practice of Christian faith. Legal, hypostatic,
and metaphysical systems tend to be inflexible. Law is approximate (writing
rules that address every circumstance is difficult—and endless). Friendship <u>frees</u>
from the rigidity of systems for ordering life that from a practical standpoint
none of our forebears could bear. Nature is “unforgiving.” Logic gives irrelevant
validity more than relevant truth. Friendship <u>interpersonalizes</u>
Christian content. Not only does the medium—law, hypostasis, language—tend to
skew the message; it tends to skew the messenger as well. To the misperceiving
observer, God himself up ends operating more like a law, a force, or a formal
line of thought than like a person who cares. Interpersonalism fosters “reality
thinking” as to how persons function, it encourages thinking beyond words, focuses
attention “beyond the sacred page,” beyond what “things” do or abstract rules
require and forbid. God has spoken to us “Son-wise” (Hebrew <b>1</b>:2).
Friendship enables wayfaring “fools” no longer to feel a need for another’s scholarly
guidance to get them through what they need to understand for life purposes. </span></p>

clear line exists between theology and praxis since theology sets the parameters
for Christian life and ministry. The first leads to the second and the second clarifies

friendship with God.</span></p>

forward, the body of Christ should concentrate on the behavioral aspects of the
faith and its implications—service to God and love for others who endeavor to glorify
him. All doctrinal issues remain on the table, but the ones that pertain to
Christian living and divine service outweigh matters of abstract form. Especially
given the fact that we today are not inspired apostles, concentrating on
benevolent attitude toward others who love God can pave the way for any
teaching and learning the way of the Lord more perfectly anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:

New Testament has timeless content with a few issues to be adjusted because of first-century
cultural context. However, concerns arise that holy writ does not address at
all. In such cases, the disciples of Christ have to do as Paul did and infer
from what <u>is</u> revealed in order to know how to operate appropriately in
the distinctives of the modern world that are not addressed. Friendship helps make
practical determinations—if nothing more than in attitudes and motives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            On
some doctrinal matters and their applications, equally committed believers
cannot seem to reach consensus. Sometimes such matters may still be resolved
“pastorally.” Those who entertain the possibility of apostasy, for example, may
not dissuade those who believe in perseverance of the saints. But, everyone in
this discussion agrees that Christians should remain faithful and grow
throughout life to honor God, respect people, and reap the blessings of living
right. Everyone can encourage everyone else to fulfill that pattern and leave
judgment to God. Even if a one-time genuine conversion were permanently satisfactory
to God, <u>we</u> are in no position to know whether that conversion was, in
fact, genuine or how genuine is genuine enough—under this or that circumstance.
Furthermore, God’s people are in no position to pronounce on the degree of grace
he considers appropriate in each case. Were we to face the struggles someone
else faces, we who consider ourselves right with God might not fare even as
well as that person has. Both we and such a person know not to presume on friendships
and that not persevering ruins our testimony and deprives us of the blessings
of friendship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
the definitive literature of our faith, Messiah himself warned that his
enterprise would reorder who is first and last (Matthew <b>19</b>:30; <b>20</b>:6;
Mark <b>9</b>:35; <b>10</b>:31; Luke <b>13</b>:30). He brought a different
agenda from what typically occupied his contemporaries’ religious attention. The
same group of people evaluated by wealth will not rank the same as when
evaluated by looks, athletic ability, fame, decency. Jesus thanked the Father
that what God was bringing into the world the wise did not catch, but babes did
(Matthew <b>11</b>:25). Paul likewise observed that wisdom does not lead to the
knowledge of God (1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:21). He directed Titus to shun endless
genealogies and pointless speculation (Titus<b> 3</b>:9). In his last letter,
he wrote about those who are <i>“always learning and never able to come to a knowledge
of the truth”</i> (2 Timothy <b>3</b>:7). These comments come in the tradition
of Isaiah’s ancient sentiment that what God values can be grasped by any
wayfaring fool (Isaiah <b>35</b>:8).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
inference from such declarations seems to be that when the study of revelation
gets hopelessly complicated and the body of believers disintegrates into
endless fragmentation, they have missed the point; they have adopted the wrong theological
method, they are pursuing the wrong kind of subject matter, they are carrying
out the wrong agenda. They have fallen into the age-old error the New Testament

constitutes the purpose and nature of God’s upward calling through Christ. The
Way of the Lord does not have the rigid complexity of legal debate, the
microscopic exactitude of scientific research, the unfathomable vagaries of
metaphysical speculation. It can’t be that hard or nobody could profit from it.
Hence, we vow not to strain out gnats and swallow camels. We already know intuitively
what God wants and how to participate in it. What is hard is not the
understanding, but the doing in the face of temptation to do otherwise, not the
understanding but getting to it, not understanding the truth but distinguishing
it from other things. We heed the charge simply to follow after love and good
works (Hebrew <b>10</b>:24). So, we resolve to focus on the simple Way and not get
tangled up again in legal, hypostatic, and metaphysical pursuits—theology gone
astray, theological scholarship falsely so called.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Choosing
friendship to characterize salvation contrasts with choosing sonship, slavery,
or disciple as the frame of reference. Does that choice, however, beg the
question on the apostasy issue, for example? Perhaps choosing to start with
friendship does not lead to the apostasy view, but merely reflects it. If so,
the reversibility of friendship provides an independent tool for getting behind
the ambiguity sometimes seen in proof texts for either option.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The following
considerations address that question. (1) All the problem features of salvation
come from leaving friendship and lapsing into material, legal, or metaphysical
categories. What resolves controversies in a group sets the context for
avoiding difficulties in any one issue individually. To put it differently, all
the aberrations in the history of Christian thought have been some kind of
departure from the interpersonal reality, or to put it more positively, some
kind of departure from the friendship reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            (2) The
burden of proof calls for positively providing an alternative starting point
that trumps friendship. Sonship might be offered as an alternative starting
point in order to provide irreversibility. But (a) <i>son</i> is not
necessarily used in order to involve irreversibility. Closeness to God,
similarity to him, learning from him, derivation from him are sufficient
explanations for using son terminology regarding salvation as surely as such
factors explain its usage in regard to other matters. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(b)
The irreversibility of sonship is in regard to physical—and perhaps
legal—things. John the Baptist pointedly told his listeners that being physical
sons of Abraham had nothing to do with being acceptable to God. The spiritual
uses of <i>son</i> refer to reversible things, and it is the spiritual factor
that belongs to this subject. The closest thing to physical sonship is
creation, but people stop becoming sons of God in the salvation sense even
though they do not cease to exist as part of his creation. It is sometimes
observed that the prodigal son was still his father’s son even while he was in
the far country. But sonship in that sense is not the issue in being acceptable
to the father—behaviorally good. His father describes him as “lost” while he
was in the far country (Luke).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(3)
Behavior would have to be either irrelevant or unavoidable for irreversibility
to speak to continued salvation; that is, characteristic bad behavior would not
undo salvation (irrelevance) or continued characteristic good behavior would
have to be supernaturally guaranteed (unavoidable). In the latter case, we
wonder how such a result could be guaranteed without eliminating free will. (a)
Behavior cannot be made irrelevant or antinomianism and universalism would
result. (b) Behavior cannot be made irrelevant or there would have been no
lostness in the first place. Disobedience is the cause of lostness whether
initial or subsequent.</span></p>
