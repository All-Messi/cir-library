<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Christian stewardship
belongs to the interpersonal system. In relationships, people do not live to themselves
or die by themselves even as in marriage the right over one’s body does not lie
in the one alone but in the other also (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:4). In social
relationships, each gives of self for the joy of the others. In that same
fashion, God has given of himself in creating, sustaining, and redeeming us. We
are not our own; we have been bought for a price, so to speak, so life itself
is ours as a stewardship to glorify God with. We give ourselves to the Lord,
who first gave himself for us (2 Corinthians<b> 8</b>:5).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In being stewards of
ourselves, we are stewards of all aspects of ourselves, including our natural
capacities, our developed skills, and any supernatural endowments. Capacities
and skills become gifts of the Spirit when we bring ourselves under the reign
of Christ in the Spirit. There is interdependence between people variously
gifted for the unity and welfare of the whole body of believers. The
stewardship of self to other selves puts stewardship in the context of relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If we are stewards of
ourselves rather than self-determining individuals, then what we “possess” we
manage, because our possessions are extensions of our selves. It is more
blessed to give than to receive (Acts <b>20</b>:35) because it expresses
relationship; and persons are more fulfilled (“blessed”) when they express
themselves relationally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism puts
stewardship on a qualitative basis. Questions about <u>amount</u> pose the
wrong question. Jesus observed that the widow’s mite represented more than all
the other gifts that day in the temple (Mark <b>12</b>:42-44). It was not the
quantity of her mite, or the percentage of her giving; the gift was evaluated
in interpersonal terms. Paul’s comments on the special offering in 2
Corinthians <b>8-9</b> are awash with interpersonal elements: God loves a
cheerful giver. Paul appreciated the gifts sent by the Philippians because they
were a sweet savor to God (Philippians <b>4</b>:18). No portion of the whole
belongs to the Lord any more than the whole belongs to him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When we encourage
people to give, we do so relative to the degree of <u>their faith</u> (Romans<b>
12</b>:3) in response to the degree of <u>God’s grace</u> (Romans <b>12</b>:6).
Trying to press people to give beyond that or aside from that moves stewardship
off its interpersonal foundation. We need to live out every aspect of our
Christian walk by the correlation between faith level and performance level; otherwise,
the level is apt to lower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Our <u>motivation</u>
for giving also stems from interpersonal factors. The <u>example</u> of other
people spurs us on (2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:9; Mark <b>12</b>:42; Philippians <b>4</b>:14
+ 19). Our <u>gratitude</u> to God and our brothers calls forth similar efforts
on our part (1 Corinthians <b>15</b>:55-58 + <b>16</b>:1; Ephesians <b>1</b>:6;
Matthew<b> 10</b>:6). We give because we care about the people we help by our
gift (2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:7-8). We give relative to the <u>need</u> that
exists and the purpose for which we give.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We give ourselves (2
Corinthians <b>8</b>:7-8) to meet people’s needs (Philippians <b>4</b>:14)
because Christ has given so much to meet our need.</span></p>
