<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> I. Prayer as interpersonal activity <u>establishes
the elements of prayer</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Prayer is talking to God, so
it is verbal <u>communication</u> from one person to another, silent or oral. Talking
to God includes whatever occurs in conversation: praise, thanksgiving,
intercession, request, confession, promise, or just talking through thoughts
and experiences. The interpersonal character of the act helps explain how our
Lord could pray all night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            II. Prayer
as interpersonal activity <u>contrasts with practices that get confused with it
or substituted for it</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Prayer differs from <u>meditation</u>
or thinking out loud. Neither is it meditation as occurs in Eastern religions—the
flight of the soul to God, the loss of individuality and self. Prayer is not
the contemplation of deity or his wonderful attributes. It is not <u>about</u> him,
but <u>to</u> him; so prayer is not merely a sense of awe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Prayer does not mean <u>communion</u>,
a sense of the actual presence of another person without direct interaction. Prayer
means more than not feeling alone or directing non-verbal sentiments to God. We
need not worry about not getting those sentiments worded well; the Spirit
intercedes for us with “groanings” we cannot verbalize (Romans <b>8</b>:26).
The message will get through to our omniscient God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Prayer is not <u>introspection</u>
or self-examination. It is not something directed inward as if the object of interest
is an aspect of our own selves or a spark within that participates with
universal consciousness. The indwelling of the Spirit must not be confused with
the religious notion of being part of the universal One. The closest thing to
“the spark of the divine within” is the image of God in us, the interpersonal
capacity we share with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Prayer is not <u>recitation</u>
as if it were a magical mantra spoken into the air rather than into the hearer.
Prayer expresses the self and addresses God. Meditation, communion, and
introspection are good in themselves, but they do not belong to prayer because
they do not take place between persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            III. Prayer
as interpersonal activity <u>eliminates certain degenerate prayer patterns and
concepts</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Remembering the
interpersonal character of prayer helps correct weak prayer patterns like
praying in vague generalities, praying infrequently, praying only in group
situations, praying in vain repetition (Matthew <b>6</b>:7), praying in archaic
English or some special language; feeling a need to use a special intonation or
eloquent expression; using only memorized prayers, canned prayers, or read
prayers; praying in the wrong direction, or trailing off into glossolalia. When
people speak to other people, they do not face someone else or word their
statements toward a third party. A preacher’s prayer is not aimed at the
congregation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Not every prayer element needs
to appear in each conversation. A prayer does not have to have a special structure
or follow an outline. It does not call for eloquence or fluency, as if it were
oratory for someone else (the audience) rather than for the One addressed. Oratory
sounds more like performance than prayer. It addresses the wrong audience,
concentrates on form more than content or purpose, and draws attention to self rather
than God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonal process
includes choice by both persons. Prayer cannot be name-it-claim-it. God processes
through his will the requests of his people: <i>“I will have mercy on whom I
will have mercy”</i> (Exodus <b>33</b>:19). He is not a genie in a lamp that people
rub to get what they want. Such behavior reduces God to a non-person or makes
him people’s servant; God’s will to choose falls out of the picture, and the
one speaking to him perverts prayer into self-centeredness. Manipulation and
coercion do not belong to any interpersonal process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Personal will affects prayer
requests that involve God’s will and the will of third parties in the matter. If
God respects the free will of his creatures, the fulfillment of a prayer about
a third part depends on that person’s heart too. We do not expect God to change
people because we pray to him to change them if they do not want to change. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Prayer as interpersonal
activity retains the existence of the one who prays and the Lord who hears.
Prayer is talking to God—with all the possibilities that can involve.</span></p>
