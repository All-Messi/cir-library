<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism
applies to the ultimate frame of reference in that deity forms a three-person
unity. In philosophy, “God” refers to ultimate reality. In scripture, this
reality is personal because he is counselor who has no counselor (Psalm <b>11</b>:3-4),
his pleasure is what measures all doing, and his glory is the effect of everything
that happens (Ephesians <b>1</b>:11; Psalm <b>19</b>:1). Interpersonalism
represents the most complex form of existence. It stands to reason that if it
exists in the created realm, it should be present in what originated everything
in the created realm. The stream, we say, cannot rise above its source. The
most inclusive understanding of God is at the “corporate,” or triune, level. The
traditional doctrine of trinity combines into one concept unity, diversity,
equality, and order and puts it before all other reality. Note the title <i>The
Eternal We</i>, by Harold J. Green (Chicago, Ill.: Loyola University Press, 1987).
Trinity is not just any kind of threeness-in-oneness; it is an interpersonal
threeness-in-oneness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Saying that
interpersonalism (trinity) in God is the case is a different thing from needing
to understand it fully to relate to him. Otherwise, it would be clearer in the
Bible, especially for those living before Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism avoids
the specter of a self-centered God who creates and wills to his own glory. Ephesians
<b>1</b> points out that human behavior redounds to the glory of God’s grace. The
implication is that by virtue of grace God himself has first given. By creating
what is, God bears responsibility for creation, including personal beings. The
association between God and his personal creation is not an impersonal one that
manipulates, demands, and coerces; nor does he operate in a one-directional
fashion from above to below. It is an association in which, after creating, he
also gives of himself to what he has made; and the glory that comes to him is
not so much demanded by him as motivated in us. His glory comes from our free
response of gratitude for his previous grace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>God’s <u>authority</u>
flows from his <u>responsibility</u> by virtue of <u>creatorship</u> and <u>grace</u>.
Divine authority does not result from ascendancy through conquest as if might makes
right; creation and grace are what makes right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Christianity can consider
understanding all reality as <u>theology</u>. Every aspect of the whole falls
under the terminology “the theology of ____.” Such wording means that each
topic is thought of in connection with the ultimate frame of reference: a
theology of leisure, theology of science, a theology of social concern. The
Judaeo-Christian conception makes person ultimate; hence, it makes theology
possible. Otherwise, it would merely be philosophy, a more depersonalized
system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>God as the ultimate
frame of reference does not represent an <u>idea</u>. He is not the “god of the
gaps,” a mere symbol for the unknown; he does not represent the missing pieces
in human knowledge—with the result that he is a diminishing quantity as knowledge
increases. Moreover, he is not merely an idea like the principle of order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>One reason that
confirms seeing ultimate reality as (inter)personal is that the patterns of
reality are not absolutely uniform. Nature does not vary from what is built
into it, because nothing transcends it to alter it. In keeping with this
observation, we cannot always get what we want by scientific means. The most
important value of interpersonalism over nature lies in the potential intervention
of God’s mind and will into it to set it aside to gain a larger purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There is a difference
between <u>impersonal uniformity</u> and <u>personal consistency</u>. Persons
can use more than one way to achieve the same goal; they may create new ways to
do it. The results are not <u>deterministically produced</u> but <u>creatively
produced</u> in a pattern. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Another way of handling
this lack of uniformity is to suppose that we simply do not understand the
physical laws well enough. If and when we do, these apparent disconformities
would disappear by refinements in what we understand.</span></p>
