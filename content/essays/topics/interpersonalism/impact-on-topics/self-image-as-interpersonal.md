<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-40.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christians sometimes object
to good self-image and feeling good about ourselves as somehow bad. The problem
comes from an overreaction. To get people to see their need for salvation, Christians
sometimes overdo how evil unsaved people are. Furthermore, they seem to think
that feeling good about themselves makes God’s salvation unnecessary or it
makes them feel them can save themselves. Interpersonalism keeps the balance between
responsibility and dependence. We are responsible for responding on our side of
the relationship, but our responses on our side of the relationship do not
establish the relationship. We depend on the other Person to establish it from
the other side—to accept us—because he is the offended party.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-40.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Self-image comes from living
interpersonally by positive values. <u>Being created in God’s image</u> means
we are not impersonal like plants, animals, and inorganic matter; we have the
interpersonal capacity. Being in God’s image gives us a firm foundation for proper
dignity and self-regard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-40.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our self-image comes largely
from <u>other people’s feedback</u>, especially from others we value like
parents, peers, spouse, siblings, teachers, friends. They indicate their
attitude toward us by taking time with us, doing things for us, initiating
activity with us, valuing our opinion, inviting us into their lives, giving us
special information, looking us in the eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-40.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our self-image comes from
our <u>activity toward other people</u>. When we <b>(a)</b> <i>replace law with</i>
<i>grace</i>, we likewise replace works with faith and perfection with growth. Grace,
faith, and growth are interpersonal operations. We give up earning and
producing results by our own actions alone and rely on feedback from other people
as the basis for worth. When we <b>(b)</b> <i>replace competition with caring</i>,
we are replacing individualism with interpersonalism. Competition is a negative
way of relating to other people by individually trying to get self-worth by
being better than they are. Living interpersonally <b>(c)</b> <i>gives up
passiveness as a manner of</i> <i>relating to other people</i>. A person takes
initiative to do something rather than waiting for others to initiate. Living
passively makes the other person the main actor. Living interpersonally, we <b>(d)</b>
<i>give up self-evaluation based on</i> <i>materialism</i>. We no longer view
ourselves as good or bad depending on physical, material considerations like
what we own, what abilities we possess, and the physical characteristics we
have. Genetic features no longer count toward self-worth because we have no
control over what nature gives us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-40.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

pride by deriving from a comparison between responsibility and how well we
fulfill it. That contrasts with pride in its negative sense, which derives from
comparison between us and other people.                                      </span><span
