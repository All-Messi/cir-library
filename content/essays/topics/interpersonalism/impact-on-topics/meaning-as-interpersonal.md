margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Meaning addresses the connection between things. The
meaning of a word refers to its connection with its referent—what it refers to.
The meaning of a part in a system refers to the purpose it fulfills in
connection with the rest of the parts that form the whole. Connectivity is the
essence of the theory of meaning. Now to apply it to persons in relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Meaning relates to
ethics. As ethical considerations stem from relationship and purpose so
meaningfulness stems from those same two existential and eschatological
components. Significance comes from the combined interaction of lateral and
longitudinal activity. Meaning differs from ethics because it covers more than
moral matters, but its interpersonal character applies to ethics because we choose
to purpose what others help us accomplish and because we relate through love. The
fulfillment of purpose, the experience of living, and being loved give us a
sense of worth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In connection with the <u>relational
component</u>, objectively God serves as a point of orientation for each of us and
as a center of unity for all of us. He initiated love by creation and grace. Subjectively
we have a sense of belonging, wholeness, orientation, and loyalty to <u>someone</u>
bigger than ourselves, all of which fosters the experience of self-worth in the
context of the church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In connection with the <u>directional
component</u>, God objectively establishes purpose and guarantees it with
omnipotence. He creates the new, charts the course, and reveals his nature and
purpose. Subjectively we realize personal purpose by participating in the plan
of God. We have a sense of belonging to <u>something</u> bigger than ourselves.
Objective meaning lies in God’s personally being there with grace and purpose guaranteed
by power. Subjectively meaning comes to us from response to his presence with trust
and from our endeavors carried out within the guidelines of progress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The sense of
meaninglessness comes from sin because sin breaks relationships, frustrates
purposes, and works against nature. Sin weakens the sense of worth because we
sense rejection when sinned against. Sin diminishes our sense of worth because we
do not find fulfillment through accomplishment. Meaninglessness comes when we
reject the interpersonal structure of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Meaninglessness shows
itself in many ways: seeking pleasure; attempting to escape through busy-ness,
substance abuse, laziness, sleep, even suicide; straining after power, courting
fame, accumulating possessions, amassing knowledge. <u>Life</u> is the biblical
word for meaningful existence, which Jesus came to provide in abundance (John <b>10</b>:10).
Receiving abundant life is the same thing as saving our “soul.” Losing life
means losing our soul, losing identity, akin to something slaves lose from a
societal standpoint; they are no one on their own. We find identity by entering
relationships. By ourselves we stray like wandering stars; we do not play a
part; we do not belong; <u>we are meaningless</u>. Objectively we lose <u>identity</u>
when we separate; subjectively <u>we feel meaningless</u>. The rich fool had
his life and soul required of him because he invested his identity in things
and pleasure (Luke <b>12</b>:15-21). Life as meaningful existence does not consist
in things (Luke <b>12</b>:15), inward-directedness, or self-centered behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>These insights from
scripture appear also in other literature. George Herbert Mead in <i>Mind,
Self, and Society</i> said, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“The self is
something which has a development; it is not initially there, at birth, but
arises in the process of social experience and activity, that is, develops in
the given individual as a result of his relations to that process as a whole
and to other individuals within that process.”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Karl Jaspers speaks similarly in <i>Existenzphilosophie</i>,
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:18.0pt'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“The thesis of my philosophizing is: The individual cannot
become human by himself. Self-being is only real in communication with another
self-being. Alone, I sink into gloomy isolation—only in community with others
can I be revealed in the act of mutual discovery.”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>And there is the saying, <i>“The end of
communication is community.”</i></span></p>
