<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I. Theologically the church is an
interpersonal system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The church as the kingdom of
heaven now does not share identity with any political entity. Civil religion
and state church, while characteristic of Mosaism, are foreign to Christ’s
kingdom. In the Messiah there is neither Jew nor Gentile. It is comparable to
spiritual Israel, being a Jew inwardly. The kingdom of “heaven” is
transpolitical, transnational, transcultural, interpersonal. The kingdom of God
“suffers violence” when people try to turn it into something political-militaristic-geographical
(Luke <b>16</b>:16-17). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Jesus told the woman at
Sychar that the central place of worship no longer mattered, whether Gerizim or
Jerusalem or elsewhere. Worship was a matter of spirit (non-material, interpersonal)
and truth (John <b>4</b>:24; cp. Emil Bruner’s book <i>The Misunderstanding of
the Church</i>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Paul’s confrontation with
Judaizers dealt with this question. Becoming a Christian did not include
becoming a Jew via circumcision, which brought a person under Jewish
citizenship as well as under legal righteousness—the principle of personal
perfection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Inasmuch as the church is
not a kingdom of this world (John <b>18</b>:36), it does not have <u>geographical
identity</u> (<i>“neither here nor in Jerusalem</i>,” John <b>4</b>:21). Instead,
the kingdom of God is interpersonal, in you, among you, rather than here or
there (Luke <b>17</b>:21). Perhaps Jesus had this point in mind when he used a
child to demonstrate the temperament people in his kingdom are to have. Children
simply relate; there is no formal organization among them. In his flesh, Jesus
abolished the Law—the enmity between Jew and Gentile—to create a new united
mankind (Ephesians <b>2</b>:15). The Law included national identity; so
impersonal political force came in with it. In fully expending himself for us,
Jesus established an interpersonal alternative to a legal identity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. The church accomplishes its purpose
by interpersonal means.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The kingdom is not promoted
or protected by political fiat. <i>“My kingdom is not of this world; otherwise,
my servants would be fighting to keep me from being delivered into your hands” </i>(John
<b>18</b>:36). It does not come or grow by <u>military might</u> but by proclamation—by
interpersonal means, by influence, not force. The parable about leaven pictures
the permeating manner of spreading Christ’s influence in the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Consequently, the church
does not seek to accomplish its role in the world through <u>legislative means</u>.
We cannot legislate Christian morality; so we cannot depend on “the laws of the
lands” to re-enforce the high ethical standards we espouse. Christians
themselves live by a higher code than cultural mandates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  It is just at this
point that <u>liberation theology</u> fails to appreciate the genius of the Messianic
kingdom. Liberation theology wants to accomplish by military and legislative
means—force and authority—what supposedly cannot come Christ’s way. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. The church is a witness to grace
rather than a channel of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Great Commission
indicates that the church witnesses to grace, not dispenses grace. Disciples
are made by teaching. The “flow of grace” comes directly from God to the sinner
as we would expect an interpersonal system to operate. So, many traditional practices
are theologically foreign to the nature of the church: tying the validity of
ministry to “apostolic succession,” requiring official administrators for ordinances,
presuming to claim priestly absolution of other people’s sin. These concepts assume
a clergy-laity distinction antithetical to the priesthood of all believers. Official
priesthood rings foreign to the interpersonal character of the kingdom.
Intermediaries create indirectness between saver and sinner, but personal
relationship by nature cannot be other than direct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>IV. The church is primarily people and
service more than order and form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Personal relationship trumps
organizational pattern in getting things done. Clerical power and hierarchical
organization should be at least minimized, because “red tape” stifles
creativity, initiative, motivation, and spontaneity, which belong to persons in
touch with each other. Trust and trustworthiness replace force and authority as
the manner and means of operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some fellowships regard
church organization a matter of indifference—one of the “adiaphora.” Organization
can exist for practical (<i>vs</i>. theological) purposes as long as it enhances
the purpose and orderly operation of the body. Such organization would be
instituted by positive commandment since it does not derive from first
principles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The church is people before
it is pattern. It is people in divine relationship more than structure based on
authority flow. The church is life quality before it is position. Theologically
it is persons more than pattern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            V. The
interpersonal character of the kingdom correlates with the kind of benefits it
promises. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        <i>“My
peace I leave with you, not like the world offers”</i> (John <b>14</b>:27). Personal-interpersonal
peace is different from political peace. It is inner peace; but more than that,
it is a peace with God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This concept fits with the
soteriological observation that the only necessary and uniform benefit of
Christianity in this life is a quality of social relations. This uniformity
fosters derivative benefits like psychological strength, strength to cope with
suffering, and a heightened sense of self-worth. Christianity does not, for
example, promise a <u>health and wealth</u> life or a <u>name-it-claim-it</u>
attitude toward prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonal understanding
of the church answers the paedobaptist question: if there is no salvation
outside the church, are not unbaptized infants therefore lost? But church
membership means simply the company of those saved through the gospel of
Christ. The church results from aggregating those who believe, repent, and
identify with Christ. The kingdom centers on a Person with whom human persons
identify. The church has no existence aside from acts by which one would enter
it. It takes legal enactment to create a class before anyone fills it as a null
category. The “class” is not a legal, natural, or logical category, but the body
of Jesus Christ perpetuated in the world. Instead, it is people organized for
mission. Therefore, irrespective of the church, theory accommodates unlost
children, the “safe” as well as the saved. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The church is charismatic
rather than institutional. It is more akin to the judgeship period than the
monarchy in the Old Testament. A general pattern occurs over time when
movements become <u>isms</u>. That is a difference between John Wesley and
later Methodism, Alexander Campbell and modern Campbellianism, Karl Marx and
Russian Marxism (cp. <i>Verdict</i>, Essay 29, 1987). The process of
crystallization is a process of perversion. It degenerates an organism into an
organization. In the history of Christianity, that degeneration went from
people to pattern when the bishop became the essence of the church.</span></p>
