<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Psychological strength comes
from friendship. We often reference psychological strength to inner factors
because it contrasts with outer flux; we can experience “inner peace” even during
unstable circumstances. But psychological strength is not so much inner peace
amidst outer chaos as it is “inter” strength from other persons. Our inner
stability came from someone else. Furthermore, psychological strength ties to
personhood in our commitment to an ever-present, immutable God and to others in
relationship with us through him--fellowship. Strength persists in the face of
destruction because of one person’s concern to help others by doing what may
relieve them, save them, and give them peace, power, and joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The power to cope comes, not
so much because it is an inborn talent, a learned skill, or a supernatural
deposit; it comes from personal response to influence from good people. That kind
of empowerment God does not dispense by stimulus or miracle. There are two
sides to the process, but they are not impersonal stimulus and automatic
response; they are one person’s encouragement and another person’s hope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            An example of that dynamic
occurred in the Garden of Gethsemane when an angel appeared to Jesus to strengthen
him (Luke <b>22</b>:43?; cp. Matthew<b> 4</b>:11). The angel did not perform a
miracle on him, do something to him, or protect him from something. Beyond
visible presence and communication, what could we suppose the angel did?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Having conscious connection
with the one true God creates a personal stack pole for life that overcomes
fragmentation and disorientation and consequently gives strength. When we feel
at home, we know better how to organize our energies. We have a sense of
identity with a personal center who can fulfill all the yearnings of our hearts
(1 Corinthians <b>14</b>:24-25).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            An interpersonal referent
lies among the many implications of 1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:31: <i>“Do
everything as to the Lord.”</i> A sense of wholeness comes because that attitude
unifies all life’s aspects under one frame of reference. It gives value and
dignity to all activities we perform under his leadership. Even agriculture,
forestry, and other impersonal operations fall under the Creation Mandate—to be
caretakers for the world. Doing everything as to the Lord puts a positive spin
on negative and difficult circumstances (Colossians<b> 3</b>:22-23).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism encourages
us to let other people help us. One great value of faith is that faith as trust
allows us to tap into the resources of others to find assistance beyond our own
capacities. Jesus prayed on the night of his betrayal, and he even requested
his disciples to pray with him (Matthew <b>26</b>:36-46). When we realize the
level of our weakness, we are strong because we do not expect too much from
ourselves alone and because we reach out for the help others can provide. We
trust God to supply our needs (Philippians <b>4</b>:19; 1 Timothy<b> 6</b>:6-8;
Hebrews <b>13</b>:5). The Apostle Peter encourages his readers to conceive of
their problems as given to Christ (1 Peter <b>5</b>:6-7).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Love encapsules all positive
personal relationships. It produces an outward-directed personality type. Paul
does not surprise us then when he says that love bears all things (1
Corinthians <b>13</b>:7); love is strong. Elsewhere he says that love builds
others up (1 Corinthians <b>8</b>:1). <i>“Be strong. Do everything in love”</i>
(1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:13-14). People who practice love get out of themselves
and direct themselves outwardly; so in building other people up they strengthen
themselves.</span></p>
