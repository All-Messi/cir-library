<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-31.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:6
Paul declares that the “letter” kills, but the spirit gives life. His point
appears to be that the absoluteness and inflexibility of law stifles and destroys
persons in operation, especially in relation with each other. It drives people
away even as the Israelites turned away from the glow on Moses’ face. The “spirit,”
or purpose, of the Law corresponds with the Person who gave it. <i>“Cutting
someone a little slack”</i> is a liberating experience. On this usage of&nbsp;“spirit,”
compare John <b>1</b>:17; <b>4</b>:23; Romans <b>7</b>:6; Galatians <b>3-4</b>.
Spirit appears to mean personal and interpersonal in contrast to letter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-31.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When we say that
Christianity is an interpersonal system, we say so in contrast to its being a
legal one. Its watch words are “faith,” “grace,” “promise.” The Law, coming later
than promise, did not annul promise; it was operative only insofar as it reinforced
the purpose of the previous promise. Law is not of faith (Galatians <b>3</b>). Faith
does not, however, make law of no effect but establishes, or reinforces, it
inasmuch as both gospel and law are concerned with the same issue: human
righteousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-31.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Law amounts to something
distinct from the lawgiver. For it to be law, it operates separately by
principles natural to itself and is impersonal, or non-personal, in nature. In
keeping with the legal nature of the Old Testament system, there was a
priesthood that interceded whereas in the gospel age (Christ) all the members comprise
a kingdom of “priests.” This system is labeled “the priesthood of all
believers.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-31.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We must keep in mind two
important characteristics of law. Law does not have to conform to the nature of
reality to be in force or require compliance. The connectors in legal process
are authority; in interpersonal process the connectors are choices.</span></p>
