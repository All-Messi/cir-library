<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            What makes things the way
they ought to be and what helps things improve to even better levels is also
what corrects what is not the way it should be. The characteristics of
interpersonalism give it a problem-solving power for personal problems. Inasmuch
as interpersonalism has the full range of characteristics existent in persons
and associations between persons, it has the potential for solving all the
problems that persons in relationship can have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism allows for
(1) the <u>objective-subjective variable</u>. In so doing, it can incorporate
elements like intentionality, sincerity, invincible ignorance. It also allows
for (2) <u>degree</u> because it builds on reciprocal causation, which can
change things by degrees. In contrast to law, nature, and logic,
interpersonalism allows for (3) <u>unspecified possibilities</u> (from another
person’s will) to be honored. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism allows for
(4) “compatible opposites,” or <u>dialectic</u> because of the reciprocation
pattern and the objective-subjective variable that interpersonalism has (cp.
David Myer’s article in <i>Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation</i>,
Sept. 1987, pp. 128-39). This concept, for example, is the larger truth that
qualifies grace and works as separate elements that are false as absolutes but
true in combination. They can be combined via people’s attitude. There is a
psychological combination of otherwise opposites. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Often a society’s <u>legal</u>
set-up allows, even requires, situations that are not morally right or
experientially preferable; but interpersonal mechanisms can ameliorate those
situations. Paul appeals to that fact in dealing with slavery in the Greco-Roman
world. He advises his readers to obey their masters as they would Christ and to
do it willingly, taking hold of the situation positively rather than passively
or resistantly. He turns the situation around the other way, too, telling
masters not to threaten their slaves (Ephesians <b>6</b>:5-9; Colossians<b> 3</b>:22-25).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sometimes we cannot do
anything about the <u>physical</u> situation itself, but by showing concern, we
can relieve the stress and distress that is present in the pain itself. <i>“Whoever
compels you to go one mile, go with him two”</i> (Matthew <b>5</b>:41). The
personal ability to transcend circumstance provides a way out of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Circumstances arise that put
conflicting principles in juxtaposition. The variable between <u>objective and
subjective</u> helps people work through those practical difficulties. There
was a case where a man was simply living with a woman by whom he had children. He
had not divorced his former wife and had no idea where she was. He became a
Christian. How could he handle such a situation? This and other cases involved
in marriage and remarriage can be solved by applying the subjective-objective
variable. Objectively the remarried person is in a situation that God never
intended. Subjectively the persons involved can affirm the ideals and values of
Christ, can renounce and repent of those past acts that led them to the present
circumstance, and commit themselves to live in the circumstance as if it were
first marriage. That is the objective problem subjectively solved, and it
partakes of the same contours of solution as salvation from past sin generally.
(Here we are dealing with a present circumstance whose “solution” would be
worse than the problem itself.) The past cannot be undone, but it can be
removed subjectively by repentance on the part of the offender and forgiveness
on the part of the offended so that it no longer affects present relationships.
The present then proceeds as much as possible as if the past had not happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Law, nature, and ideas are
timeless and spaceless. Not knowing about them is irrelevant to any error because
of that ignorance. Intention on the subjective side does not account for
anything. Interpersonalism can combine objective and subjective into an
interacting whole between <u>inner and outer aspects</u> of a person. Science,
law, and metaphysics do not do this. The added subjective component provides an
additional basis for solving more problems that pertain to people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The problem-solving power of
interpersonalism comes from the “slippage” that is natural to it on both sides
of it. Interpersonalism does not have a one-to-one relationship between one
step and the next; that is, it is not deterministic. Slippage is created by (1)
a breakdown in <u>communication</u> because of the limitation of human
language; one person does not understand what the other person means. Slippage
is also created by (2) a breakdown in <u>performance</u> because of human
weaknesses; we do not do the good that we know to do; we do not even do the
good we want to do. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The two breakdowns are
remedied by “understanding” what it is like to be human. That understanding on
the part of the first person means that repentance plus forgiveness can remedy
what would otherwise destroy the relationship between persons 1 and 2. In the
breakdown of communication, genuine ignorance is indicated by willingness to
listen to explanation plus repentance when understanding comes. In the
breakdown between knowledge and performance, repentance plus forgiveness occurs
upon coming to our senses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is some difference in
correction between the two types of failure. In the first instance, the first
person may overlook honest mistakes before the other person realizes having
made them. Then when the other person does notice the misunderstanding and
consequent mis-action, the person repents and seeks to correct consequences;
and forgiveness takes place even though overlooking had been occurring until
further enlightenment had turned a situation of ignorant failure (that required
nothing for it to be overlooked) to a situation of conscious error (that
required repentance and restitution in order to be forgiven). When awareness
comes, the call for obedience comes with it. Consequently, the lack of changed
characteristic behavior or the lack of correcting a past discrete error
naturally changes the person from innocent to guilty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The interpersonal character
of Christianity accounts for the interesting phenomenon of positive commandment
without necessarily having a corresponding prohibition or negation. Does an
unbaptized believer do something wrong by partaking of communion, for example,
a child raised in a Christian home? Since it is an interpersonal act, partaking
does not equal sin nor is it illegal. We may say it is not appropriate or as
appropriate, but intentionality and commitment may occur aside from the
positive commandment for the formal act. </span></p>
