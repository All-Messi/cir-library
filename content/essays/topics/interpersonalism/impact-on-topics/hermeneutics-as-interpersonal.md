.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism
establishes a theological method</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Interpersonalism
impacts hermeneutics by establishing a programmatic for interpreting the Bible.
What does not deduce from interpersonalism must be firmly established by
primary proof. Primary proof is the kind of proof that requires one conclusion,
while secondary evidence confirms what comes from primary. Primary proof that
does not arise from the nature of the case (interpersonalism ultimately) must
rest on positive commandment rather than moral law, because moral law refers to
what comes from the nature of the case. Interpersonalism establishes what is to
be regarded <i>a priori</i> as central. It becomes a way of shouldering
appropriately the positive burden of proof on many issues. Interpersonalism
calls for doing theology in the interpersonal mode because it goes on in an
interpersonal context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>This claim does not
mean that matters not derived from interpersonalism are negotiable. Rather, the
reasons for them must be quite clear; they must rest on unambiguous facts, that
is, on primary evidence. Viewpoints that do derive from interpersonal
implication are thereby established even when the wording of relevant texts could
be taken in a different way. The resurrection, virgin birth, deity of Christ,
inerrancy rest on clear evidence even though they may not be inherently
necessary parts of the Christianity. Interpersonalism says something
significant about most issues in faith and practice, but most basically it sets
the category for the nature of truth, the character of Christian faith, the
central <i>vs</i>. less central position of various items. Interpersonalism is
a common thread through most topics of Christian thought. In conformity with
this observation, interpersonalism sets the theological method for thinking
about the Christian faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism
determines what is false and foreign</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>.
Interpersonalism provides a tool for setting aside exegetical options foreign
or contradictory to interpersonalism. Evening though the wording of a text
could convey a certain idea, that idea is dismissed if it does not conform to
the requirements of person-on-person interaction. Interpersonalism establishes the
arena where theology operates—what kind of game it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Interpersonalism
determines what is central</u>. It locates an item’s relative centrality in the
Christian system. It helps sort the true from the irrelevant and the false, but
sorts among the true to determine how intensely we promote and defend each subject.
Conversely, interpersonalism helps sort among erroneous understandings and evaluates
the seriousness of the error in various misconceptions. The practical value
here lies in giving Christians a criterion for determining how urgently we deal
with another person’s error, how much attention to give to correcting it, and
whether to risk dividing the fellowship over it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism
determines what is literal</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Interpersonalism
serves as a tool for distinguishing analogy from reality. It helps with
deciding the point of illustrations and comparisons by predicting what exists
in a comparison (figure of speech) that corresponds with the topic at hand. It
helps separate the relevant from irrelevant (“scenery”) in illustrations,
parables, metaphors, similes, and the like; and so it determines how much
transfers from the illustration to the illustrated. If interpersonalism is the
“nature of the case” in Christianity, it keeps an interpreter from “allegorizing
the comparison” in biblical exegesis. Examples where this point seems to apply
include the “rewards” of the Christian life, eternal “punishment,” various
imageries for the atonement. The consequence of the Christian life as “inheritance”
is another case: it would allegorize the comparison to suppose the effect was
something lost by one person and transferred to another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>People read scripture through
the lens of their own personalities. A critical, judgmental personality may “fix”
on divine wrath. A perfectionist reads the Bible in stricter fashion. Such a
mind assumes that scripture speaks legalistically because the legal feels natural.
In effect legalistic, perfectionist, relational, <i>laissez-faire</i> readers
each one end up hermeneutically creating God in their own image. Remembering
that scriptural revelation is dealing with a person should moderate such
tendencies. Personality can impact hermeneutics through a pendulum effect. To
dissociate themselves from one another, people may look for ways to read a
passage that counters that other person’s position more than seek the author’s mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In New Testament
teaching, two contemporary issues contrasted with interpersonalism. One was (1)
the nature of the Messianic kingdom as spiritual/interpersonal <i>vs</i>. the political/material/geographical/legal
kingdom current Judaism expected. The Great Commission highlights that
difference. Another issue was (2) the nature of salvation as reconciliation
through grace-faith as distinguished from the Gnostic concept of salvation as hypostatic
via knowledge. The first came from the Jewish arena; the second from the
Gentile area. Christ’s death, <i>e.g</i>., was a stumbling block to Jews and
foolishness to Greeks (1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:23).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Semitic idiom tends to <u>omit
intermediate causes</u> and therefore <u>causal distinctions</u>. Ultimate
inspiring source and immediate cause can be worded alike, which may blur the
connection. The point is not so much about the nature of the Semitic language
itself, but about the manner of thinking that used it. Semites could
distinguish between ultimate cause, immediate causation, and other causal
modes. But the manner of using language came from a more <u>personalized worldview</u>.
As noted earlier, personalization is not personification. In the former
instance, the cosmos is not deity, a manifestation of deity, an emanation,
aspect, or extension of deity. Instead, the universe is serves as an instrument
of deity, distinct from God in identity and kind. The universe is not a model,
parable, or an analogy of the person of God, but it derives from him by
creation from nothing as a separate reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Fluctuation and
variability as to mode and immediacy of causation stems from the complexity of
persons in comparison to other orders of being. When ultimate reality is
personal—omniscient and omnipotent at that, all events have a personal connection,
because they transpire within that setting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The implications of
these observations run deep both for hermeneutics and for Christian thought
generally. In hermeneutics, not making allowance for Semitic linguistic
distinctives leads to foreign ideas if taken in a more scientific, literal
manner of speaking. It leads toward Calvinistic impersonalism and other forms
of determinism. In Christian thought, all events do occur under the watchful
eye of omnipotent, omniscient, loving deity—just not deterministically so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Whereas immediacy of
causation deals with direct <i>vs</i>. indirect, modes of causation deal with things
like prescriptive <i>vs</i>. permissive (appointed <i>vs.</i> allowed,
preferred vs<i>.</i> accepted, restrictive <i>vs.</i> non-restrictive) and
primary <i>vs.</i> confirmatory evidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Perhaps another way to
deal with the linguistic and hermeneutical issue is to say that ancient scripture
speaks more in <u>phenomenological language</u> than modern English does. The
way an event looks is how an observer talks about it. What makes an event “look”
a certain way is the position, mindset, cosmology of the beholder. Consequently,
the “God talk” of scripture did not have the same force for a Semite as it does
for a Western speaker accustomed to more straightforward expression. So we
should not interpret such language as we would mean it when speaking in our
customary way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism shows
how there can be hermeneutical restraint even as there should be judicial
restraint in jurisprudence. In interpretation people have settled ontological
and eschatological questions “close enough” if the theoretical view they take
can allow for the practical and relational results that scripture clearly
promises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Summary of the
hermeneutical programmatic</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>      1. Interpersonalism
becomes a principle/truth for evaluating the <u>relative centrality</u> of
specifics in Christianity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>      2. Interpersonalism
becomes a principle for showing what ideas are in fact part of the faith and
which are not. If an item of doctrine is not systematically required, a
positive biblical foundation must bear the whole weight of establishing that
idea. This point about interpretation requires special emphasis on the
principle that the burden of exegetical proof falls on the affirmative. If other
sensible interpretations are possible, then at best a particular interpretation
must be held as an opinion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  3. Interpersonalism
qualifies the way we perceive the intended <u>nature</u> of some matter as well
as the <u>relevance</u> of various concerns (opinion/liberty).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  4. Interpersonalism
provides a way of “solving” problems that in other ultimate frameworks would be
insoluble—as in logical, natural, and legal paradigms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  5. Interpersonalism
removes the legitimacy of falling back on philosophical or other-than-interpersonal
presuppositions in undergirding certain doctrinal points. </span></p>

does not mean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1.   We are not speaking of
the social gospel. Social needs may serve as a point of contact through which
we can demonstrate caring. Christianity analyzes the human predicament
primarily in terms of faulty interpersonal relationships and behavior. We don’t
quit, for instance, just because the gospel is not yet accepted, lest we do to
others “in order that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2.   Interpersonalism does
not mean that there can be no ontic, logical, or legal considerations involved
in Christianity (as overlays, <i>etc</i>.), but that substantive, metaphysical,
and legal aspects do not derive from the systematic starting point, or nature
of the case; they must arise positively from scripture as the voice of God to
us. Virtually all biblical teachings about the nature of things in heaven and
on earth are brought up in scripture in connection with their implications for
human behavior and functionality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3.   Interpersonalism does
not depreciate the importance of scripture as if this starting point could generate
on its own everything important in Christianity.</span></p>
