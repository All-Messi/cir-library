<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The unevangelized have a
frame of reference by which they can approximate God’s intentions for human
behavior. They experience relationships with other persons (ethics) and can
read from that how broken friendship is overcome (salvation). The “noble pagan”
can practice the Golden Rule (The Second Great Commandment) and “grope” after
God to find him (Acts <b>17</b>:27) since deity must be superior and personal
(The First Great Commandment). So the unevangelized can be accountable and
judged in relation to their limited perspective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Romans <b>2</b>:11-16
identifies conscience as an alternative frame of reference. <u>Conscience</u>
is a personal characteristic that can function in the absence of <u>revelation</u>
(law). God evaluates the unevangelized by how they act relative to where their
conscience properly leads them. God judges them by the light that they have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If the unevangelized keep
the ordinances, ritual matters (circumcision, <i>e.g</i>.) based on positive
commandments can be regarded as done. From the standpoint of motives, they
would have done them had they known. The kind of people who do the
interpersonal and moral aspects of the Law have an attitude that would do the
formal ones if they knew to do them. Jesus seems to have said as much even of
Tyre and Sidon and Sodom (Matthew <b>11</b>:20-24; Luke <b>10</b>:13-16). That
is the way people treat each other; they do not blame other people for doing or
not doing what they cannot know. They make judgment by heart, motive, and
attitude. The idea has been called “implicit faith”: the unevangelized may have
believed had they heard. The fact that they would have obeyed shows in the fact
that many do when they are told. We can speak of their doing the dynamic
equivalent of the formal aspects of the faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The times of ignorance God
overlooks (Acts<b> 17</b>:30). He judges by the heart. Paul said of giving that
it is acceptable as people have, not as they do not have (2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:11-12)
if the willingness is there. God’s judgment of the unevangelized (beyond
matters where conscience has properly led them) reduces to <u>attitude</u> in
place of <u>content</u>. Judgment moves from a quantitative base (knowledge,
works) to a qualitative one—one appropriate to an interpersonal system. People
can distinguish subjective from objective, can honor intention in place of being
right, and can operate in qualitative as well as quantitative terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1 John <b>4</b>:7 makes the
striking statement that <i>“he who loves is begotten by God.” </i>The text does
not say, <i>“He that is begotten by God loves.”</i> Integrating that statement
with Romans <b>2</b> and Acts <b>17</b> may imply that it is not how much we
know, but how much we care—at least relative to that wherein conscience
properly leads. John, however, may be supplying a litmus test for defining
Christians against Gnostics, where salvation was not from sinful behavior but
from undesirable nature. Those who love are Christians; those who do not love
are not Christians. Whether some non-Christians love would then fall outside
his frame of reference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            John’s comment raises the
question, too, as to whether loving behavior occurs outside the circle of
Christian faith—including the unevangelized. Love fulfills the Law (Romans<b>
13</b>:10). Luther said, <i>“Love God and do what you please.”</i> What God is
really after is people caring about one another and acting accordingly. What
does the Lord require of us but to do justly, love kindness, and walk humbly
before him (Micah <b>6</b>:8; Deuteronomy<b> 30</b>:15)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The question that remains is
whether only Christians can love. Traditional theology implicitly says “no” by
its doctrines of natural depravity, no salvation outside the church, the
necessity of Holy Spirit supernatural regeneration, and so on. Those outside
the circle of faith supposedly have even their apparently good behavior tainted
with self-centered motivation; so their good acts are evil from a motivational
standpoint. Such claims can be no more than guesses made to maintain
consistency with viewpoints already taken. No scriptural comment requires such
claims about the unevangelized, and experience seems hard put to justify
egocentrism in all noble and selfless behavior by non-Christians. What will we
say of the life quality of all quasi-Christian groups, all Jews, or all those
in eastern religions? We can darken their motives, we can affirm they are
Christian equivalents, or we can suppose the possibility of genuine love outside
the faith. If those who love are begotten by God and if given people are in
fact loving, should we entertain the option that they are “begotten by God”?
That does not mean we have no obligation to teach them the way of the Lord more
perfectly (Acts <b>18</b>:26).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            With the unevangelized or
erroneously evangelized, it is not what they cannot do (learn about the true
God and his Son Jesus Christ), but what they can do—the “mark of the Christian”
(a loving disposition; cp. again 2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:11-12). Perhaps, though
they do not <u>know about Christ</u> in fact, they nevertheless <u>know Christ</u>
in principle, or in “spirit.” They are doing naturally the things of the Law
(Romans <b>2</b>:14). In this respect they seem comparable to people in the
patriarchal dispensation. The same goes for those in the Mosaic dispensation. God
figures all salvation in relation to Christ (Acts<b> 4</b>:12). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In all this, we preserve the
principle of salvation by faith <i>vs</i>. works by remembering that loving
behavior on the part of the unevangelized serves as a <u>condition</u> for
relationship to God, not a <u>cause</u> of it (merit) since no one—with or
without law—lives perfectly by any standard they adopt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The previous comments about
1 John<b> 4</b>:7 makes (1) <u>a theological observation</u>: those who love
are begotten by God whether inside or outside the circle of Christian faith. Another
possibility exists that makes (2) <u>a hermeneutical observation</u>: biblical
language sometimes does not distinguish primary proof from confirmatory evidence.
Another possible example of not distinguishing primary and confirmatory
evidence is 1 John <b>4</b>:2: <i>“Every spirit that confesses that Jesus
Christ has come in the flesh is of God.”</i> If the statement in<b> 4</b>:7 was
really meant to address a confirmatory observation, then the passage falls out
of the discussion about the unevangelized elect as postulated above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Certain comparisons seem
natural between God’s fatherhood toward us and our parenting toward children. At
the risk of allegorizing a comparison, we offer three observations based on the
fact that human parenting like divine leadership takes place primarily within
the all-encompassing category of personal relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. The unevangelized are
comparable to progressive revelation in the patriarchal and Jewish periods. We
do not require our children to believe and behave in ways we have not told them
about, nor do we punish them for what they do not know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. We do not infer that it
is better to leave the unevangelized alone because they now have less to be
responsible for and run less risk of damnation. We do not withhold things from
our children that they should know for their greater happiness just so they can
have more things to disobey with impunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3. We do not have to say
that the unevangelized are lost in God’s eyes before there is a need to save
them. First, people do not have to be lost before they need to be saved by
Christ. Second, we do not withhold from our children new responsibilities and
information just because they may balk at additional duties. It is appropriate
that our children develop. (We take readiness into consideration.) In fact, they
may rebel and alienate themselves over new responsibility even though previously
they were obedient children. The same holds true for the unevangelized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Leaving open the possibility
in theory that God may choose to save unevangelized people does not imply that he
will save them all or that there would be no more saved through “unevangelism.”
Likewise, it does not imply that they are saved some other way than through
Christ. Furthermore, we do not infer that missions has no urgency. The motive
of missions is the glory of God and the welfare of man. We simply do not assume
that only those that know about Christ can be saved by Christ. All salvation is
figured through Christ including salvation in the patriarchal (1 Peter <b>4</b>:6)
and Mosaic periods (Hebrews <b>9</b>:15), who did not know about him. Their
situation seems comparable to people <u>after</u> Christ who have not heard
about him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The intention here is not to
get caught up in speculations about unrevealed matters—like how God will render
judgment on the vast majority who have never heard of Christ. Our concern is to
use sanctified imagination to remove a stumbling block to belief based on the
idea that a holy loving God would not consign to eternal hell those who had no
chance of knowing him or his Son. If the real situation is some other way than
the one hypothesized above, well and good. But those reasonings do at least remove
a supposed problem in the case of the unevangelized when we speak of their needing
salvation through Christ alone.</span></p>
