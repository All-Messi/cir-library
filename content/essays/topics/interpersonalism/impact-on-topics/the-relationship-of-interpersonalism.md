<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism refers to
the fundamental character of reality. As such, it is a claim about worldview. <u>Interpersonal</u>
refers to the presence of the interpersonal element, but the addition of <i>ism</i>
describes the pervasive nature of things. The same goes for legal <i>vs</i>.
legal<u>ism</u>, for determined <i>vs</i>. determin<u>ism</u>, for scient<u>ism</u>,
and so on. In the latter instance, the word no longer describes an aspect, but
characterizes the whole. It becomes that by which a person integrates as much
as possible of what belongs to the whole. Only after that exercise does he
bring in secondary matters to account for exceptional or practical matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             In speaking of
interpersonal<u>ism</u>, then, we mean that the foundational character of Christianity
and the Christian worldview is interpersonal. Other matters can be involved in
operational reality, so we do not have a simple, monolithic kind of reality. But
authority/law/organization and ritual/form/symbol are overlays, not determinative
aspects of reality. They are added factors rather than primary ones. Interpersonalism
qualifies and limits whatever is added to it if the overlay creates conflict. Interpersonalism
directs the manner and purpose of using non-interpersonal things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            So, interpersonal does not
exclude other kinds of things, but it does limit their <u>scope</u> and <u>manner
of application</u>. For example, interpersonalism eliminates making
self-centered laws to use against other people or using force in a self-centered
way to obtain selfish ends. Interpersonalism shapes the character of
non-interpersonal aspects in the practical working of the whole real situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism does not
just relate to the major kinds of things. It is the primary source of reality
for all of them, directly or indirectly. It is the originating truth that
explains everything except those purposes and goals that are more restrictive
than the range of potentiality in interpersonalism itself. Such matters are
taken care of by positive commandment to restrict the broader character of
creation, because creation itself only approximates the purposes of God.      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Consequently, interpersonal
reality is what gives vitality and special meaning to other kinds of things. Interpersonalism
gives value and meaning to <u>material things</u>, so possessions become
meaningful when they become means of personal expression. The <u>body</u> as an
instrument of expressing the soul/spirit becomes more meaningful than when it
is regarded as the center, the basis, or the end in itself. <u>Legal matters</u>
should be used for interpersonal ends (“lead us to <u>Christ</u>”). Interpersonal
qualities make <u>ritual</u> into meaningful expressions of these qualities,
and in reverse they help crystallize a person’s commitment to these qualities. <u>Ideas</u>
are relatively uninteresting unless they are imbedded in a personality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A. Interpersonalism and Cosmology</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In general, interpersonal
precedes impersonal both chronologically and logically. The interpersonal
(triune) God preceded the impersonal creation. One capacity of personhood is
creativity; hence, the impersonal cosmos comes after, and is subordinate to,
the interpersonal by virtue of creativity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>B. Interpersonalism and History</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In keeping with the
potentials of personal creativity, the Christian view of history can be linear
rather than cyclical, because personal creativity has potentially within it <u>the
new</u>. Consequently, history can go somewhere new rather than be limited to
the finite number of options that have always been and cannot increase because
they are deterministically limited. Under the Judaeo-Christian view of God
there can be eschatology and there can be history in the technical sense
because history is going somewhere and is meaningful, which is the primary
significance of the doctrine of predestination. (See the interpersonal essay
entitled “Eschatology.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Personalized creation
implies <u>personalized history</u> and providence. If the ultimate frame of
reference is interpersonal, then all events that occur in the universe are in
some sense connected with the personal. Instead of a deistic god who creates
and leaves, scripture pictures a Father God who stays and directs. All
occurrences, good or bad, are either allowed to happen or are instigated directly
or indirectly by him. We have neither a universe gone wild nor one deterministically
carried forward by inbuilt law alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The <u>goal of history</u>
is not monolithic oneness but interpersonal unity. We therefore do not seek to
lose individuality by entering into an ultimate impersonal One. The goal is not
loss of individuality but proper relationship of individual persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>C. Interpersonalism and Law</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (1) <u>Interpersonalism does
not eliminate law</u>. That is the reason Paul could observe as he does in
Galatians 3 that the law added 430 years later did not annul the earlier
promise to Abraham. The <i>promise</i> to Abraham preceded the <i>law</i>
through Moses. Law and promise are mutually exclusive as to kinds of things (<b>3</b>:17-18)
even as law and faith are different kinds of things (<b>3</b>:11-12). Law, or
legal process, is a secondary principle; but promise and faith—or interpersonal
process—are the primary principle. Law is good if it is used lawfully (1
Timothy <b>1</b>:8), not as an end in itself or as a final court of appeals,
but as a superadditum, to reinforce the interpersonal enterprise. Law does not
eradicate the interpersonal but leads to it (Galatians <b>3</b>:24). Law is a
teaching aid, a definer of righteousness, a director/leader that points beyond
itself to something better—interpersonal process (“Christ”; <b>3</b>:24).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (2) <u>Law and ritual
require positive commandment for establishing them</u>. This is so because the
acts do not arise inherently and positively from the nature of the case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (3) <u>Legal and ritual factors
are always added for practical purposes</u>. They are added in a way that does
not <u>annul</u> (cp. Galatians <b>3</b>:15-22) the basic nature, which means
that the basic nature limits, contextualizes, transcends, qualifies, overrides
this additional element. Paul addresses this principle of secondary addition
without fundamental cancellation when in Galatians <b>3-4</b> he teaches that
law/the-law was added to promise but so as not to invalidate <u>promise</u>. Promise-faith-grace
speaks of interpersonal operation; law-works-merit speaks of legal operation. Legal
authority can be added to interpersonal promise, because law and promise
address different things. Law can be added to interpersonalism as long as law does
not become ultimate, which is what the Pharisees had done. Since law was added
to promise, promise qualifies law and its role in divine-human activity. What
chronologically preceded law in <u>heilsgeschichte</u> (faith) also logically
precedes it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In regard to organization,
form/authority/law is added to <u>harness power</u>. This function resembles
clarification because it helps people know who should do what, and so on. It
also helps avoid duplication and implicitly establishes a communication system
telling people who does what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            (4) <u>The exercise of the
legal is always within the boundaries of interpersonal concern</u> <u>and
welfare</u>. This addition comes in for practical reasons, but only insofar as,
and to the extent that, it enhances rather than hinders fundamental operation. “Special
circumstances,” then, have a way of being taken into consideration inasmuch as
what is more essential/ basic/central/ultimate/fundamental pre-empts law and
form. Secondary elements sometimes have a way of getting in the way of primary
ones. Secondary elements, being approximate, do not necessarily fit all
situations. The “pre-emptibleness” of law/authority/form/ritual/ structure/institution
is what we must remember about law and form in order to see their value and
their limitation, to appreciate them and yet transcend them, to use them and
not abuse them. Interpersonalism calls for full reciprocity, but only relative
to communication. Authority, then, can be added without vitiating interpersonal
process. There can be exceptions to law and form, but there can be no exception
to interpersonalism (love).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>D. Interpersonalism and Rites</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In an interpersonal system,
all rites must have an interpersonal dynamic to make them useful and relevant. Unless
ritual acts are interpersonalized, they function in the realm of legal/political
operation. If so, their validity can be detached from the interpersonal,
dynamic factor. Since Christianity has an interpersonal character, the validity
of its ritual acts requires the presence of the interpersonal. Only if baptism
were connected with non-interpersonal matters would its validity exist aside
from faith. To put it negatively, the validity of ritual cannot rest in the
form <i>per se</i>, the authority of law as such, the validity of the
officiate, and the like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Baptism—a rite—focuses into
a point what in many respects is a process. In so doing, ritual and form <u>clarify</u>
by making matters more tangible, concrete, and exact. Ritual and form help
define who we are and give us a sense of measurable, quantifiable progress in
something that is not exactly categorical or quantifiable. It helps people
define themselves by helping them see where they are. Many formal acts like
baptism are rites of passage. Their function is to reduce a process to a point.
The formal rite is instituted as a manner of expressing dynamic matters to the
viewer and as a means of focalizing dynamic matters for the doer. There is a
reciprocal interaction between self-expression and self-impression.</span></p>
