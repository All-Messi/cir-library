<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>  I. Revelation is interpersonal in that
it is from one Person to another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That point applies both to
general and revelation. Not abstracting general revelation from the One that
speaks in it amounts to the same thing as not abstracting creation from the
creator. Personalizing general revelation equals personalizing creation. Nature
has the character of revelation inasmuch as it is secondary, derivative,
dependent reality. From the characteristics of nature, we can “read” something
of the nature of its origin and originator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Revelation is never to be
abstracted from the One that speaks in it; that is, it is not to be
depersonalized. The difference between <u>personal</u> and <u>propositional</u>
truth is that propositionalizing truth can depersonalize it, and so
decontextualize it. As a result, (1) revelation loses the flexibility that
persons can incorporate into values involved in situations not envisioned in a
statement. (2) Propositional truth unqualified by the higher personal frame of
reference removes the positive basis for using motive to help judge whether an
act is sinful. (3) Propositional concept does not satisfactorily address the
nature of the reality under view. Without the hearer’s judgment and without the
nature of the case, there would be no difference between moral law and positive
commandment. The Law is good only to those who use it lawfully, that is, use it
qualified by this personal context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Written revelation is also
interpersonal according to four of the five models involved. Dictation would
not stress interpersonalism; but in places where God gave only the ideas,
abilities, experiences, or offices, there would be an increasing degree of
human input. The decreasing positive role of the Spirit in these models stands
in inverse proportion to that increasing protective activity, and the human
author has increased input. Inscripturation does not have be mechanistic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>  II. Revelation is not something
completely expressible in propositions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Misperception about the
approximate character of word revelation, especially law revelation, caused
first-century Pharisees to pervert truthful statements into untruthful
practices. Jesus may well have had in mind the need to personalize revelation
when he said, <i>“You search the scriptures because you think that in <u>them</u>
you have eternal life, and it is they that bear witness of <u>me</u>; yet you
refuse to come to <u>me</u> that you may have life”</i> (John <b>5</b>:39-40).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Language, hence, revelation
in language, is supplemented by demonstration, kinesics, and other practical
elements. In the New Testament, there is incarnation, and through scripture
there is epiphany and manifestation. Biblical revelation is not mystical as if
it were beyond propositional expression or contradictory to it. Propositional
revelation is simply inadequate to some extent. Full revelation is spirit to
spirit; it is the contact of person to person (cp. 1 Corinthians <b>2</b> and
Romans <b>8</b>). <i>“The Spirit bears witness with our spirit”</i> may mean <i>“bears
witness to <u>God</u> with our spirit,”</i> but it may mean there is a sense of
personal, invisible presence and acceptance that helps get our message through
in prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> III. Revelation is interpersonal in
that its propositions must be taken in the context of persons in       relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism fills in
what propositional statements may not express. Truth is personal, so revelation
must be personalized. Otherwise, a person is always learning without coming to
a knowledge of the truth. Paul’s point in 2 Timothy <b>3</b>:7 must be that so
much learning does not result in a correct picture of the whole and of the
ultimate. Even pagans know many things as individual items, but they do not
know the truth even about these items because they do not have a correct picture
of their context. Truth is ultimately personal because everything is ultimately
derived via creation from personal reality. Jesus reflected that by saying, <i>“I
am the way, the truth, and the life.”</i> Jesus is not just true, which would be
partial truth; but he is truth, a characterization of the real whole. Doctrine is
not an academic pursuit of accuracy as an end in itself, but something to act
right about because of who speaks in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Not abstracting scripture
from him who speaks in it means that understanding its doctrines is not
precisely the point. For one thing, understanding some things does not
necessarily impact behavior that affects relationships. For another thing, misunderstanding
some things does not invalidate the relationship we have with the One who
speaks to us there. Misunderstanding the real nature of someone does not
destroy relating to the person. Not understanding how an internal combustion
engine works does not mean a person cannot drive a car; not understanding the
precise nature of deity does not mean we cannot relate to God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The reason progressive
revelation can occur is that knowing matters formerly unrevealed was not crucial
to having divine-human relationship then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Revelation, especially in
Christ, is not just word but event, and not just event but personal event. The
incarnation involved manifesting God in personal action and interaction in the
human realm. It has not been merely <u>propositional</u> or <u>epiphany</u>
religion but <u>personal</u> revelation. It was not a metaphysical idea
historicized, but real truth personalized. Ultimate revelation has been
incarnational.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Incarnational revelation integrates
with incarnational missions together with the church as the ongoing functional
equivalent of the “body” of Christ in the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The interpersonal character
of Christianity may explain why the Bible does not provide precise, formulaic
answers to issues like giving, divorce, and some difficult matters. Interpersonalism
is a less rigid milieu than law, nature, or idea. For another thing, people are
in process; they have capacity for growth. What is right is not “one size fits
all.” What they can realistically be called on to do depends on the level of
their faith: <i>“according to the proportion of our faith”</i> (Romans <b>12</b>:6),
<i>“but you cannot bear them now”</i> (John <b>16</b>:12; 1 Corinthians <b>3</b>:2;
note also Matthew<b> 19</b>:7-12), <i>“according to his ability”</i> (Acts <b>11</b>:29;
cp. 2 Corinthians <b>8</b>:11-12;<b> 8</b>:3; 1 Corinthians <b>16</b>:2). If we
call on people to do more than they are prepared to do, we create greater
adverse effects than a lesser level of living would have produced. We wait for
readiness or motivate readiness before we call for behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The subjective principle in
canonicity integrates with interpersonalism because it addresses “the ring of
truth.” In logical sequence the <u>historical principle</u> positively
establishes the original body of authoritative literature. It does so by determining
provenance, which means who wrote it. The persons who wrote had authentication
through miraculous manifestation. The right to speak for God is indicated by
authenticating marks. The <u>doctrinal principle</u> adds consistency with
previously authenticated scripture. Then comes the <u>subjective principle</u>,
because the incarnate logos speaks to the distinctive needs of persons: drive
for innocence, desire for meaningfulness, need for love, concern for security.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In keeping with our
observation that <u>Christ</u> and <u>Spirit</u> may essentially refer to the
interpersonal system of things, Luther may have had interpersonalism in mind when
he enunciated the canonical principle: “what preaches Christ.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>IV. Revelation is interpersonal in that
it does not give detailed directions for every conceivable circumstance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The New Testament is rather
brief in comparison to the vast areas and long ages over which it directs human
affairs and divine service. God deals with us interpersonally—and as mature
persons at that—by not telling us every move to make. So to speak, God has
given us <i>“the keys of the kingdom of heaven,”</i> and whatever we bind on
earth he honors in heaven (Matthew <b>16</b>:19; <b>18</b>:18-19). The keys, we
may say, are the fundamental principles of divine-human and human-human interaction.
They are the interpersonal values that God wants true religion to have (cp.
James<b> 1</b>:27). The keys are also the revealed principles of how relationships
work. Having given us the fundamental principles, he lets us work out those values
in particular situations. What was first (a) bound in heaven (future perfect
passive <u>literally</u>) was the interpersonal category and its principles. People
are then free to creatively (b) apply them on earth in appropriate ways of
their own choosing (“binding and loosing”); and when people under God’s
guidelines do so, God (c) ratifies them in heaven (<u>idiomatic</u> future
perfect passive). We are conceiving of this point in self-reference; that is a
different thing from trying to dictate for others what we have inferred that
people should do and how they should do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            That approach to the New
Testament stands in contrast to <u>primitivism</u> or <u>restorationism</u>
misconceived to mean that we do only what we have authorization to do. Such a theological
method cannot work because biblical revelation is both too limited and too
general; it is representative, not exhaustive, regarding matters that need to
be handled. Handling appropriately means handling interpersonally. For example,
then, silence cannot equal prohibition (except in certain matters by the nature
of the case). We do not have to have a <i>“thus saith the Lord” </i>for every
move we make. We operate <u>within divine revelation</u> as a broad arrow, not <u>by
divine revelation as an exact line</u>. </span></p>

of revelation, the Bible is more than a book for historical information, a book
of concepts, or even a manual for living; it is you-to-me communication.</span></p>
