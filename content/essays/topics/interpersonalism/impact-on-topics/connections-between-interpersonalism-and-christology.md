<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Scripture makes clear
that Jesus the Messiah possessed deity in the distinctive, ontological sense. From
the standpoint of theory, it may not contradict the salvation enterprise for us
not to understand that fact fully or with complete accuracy. His sinlessness
relative to God’s will for him in the flesh appears to be the essential element
for salvation purposes. It would be best, then, not to regard as “enemies of
Christ” those who misperceive him as the first created being (who created
everything else, Colossians <b>1</b>:15-16) yet affirm his sinlessness and everything
scripture says about him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>He obviously functions
as deity and has the status and prerogatives of deity since scripture uses the
term “God” in reference to him. Besides, there is no basis for affirming his
createdness. The situation seems comparable to some Old Testament statements about
the angel of the LORD. Some people even suppose that they addressed
pre-incarnate manifestations of the Messiah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We may not need to know
that someone is a president when he tells us that such and such is wrong, will
happen, or should be understood in a particular way. We need not know everything
about someone to believe or be helped by that person in telling us something or
doing something for us. Such considerations apply to the gravity of errors about
Christology and the personality of the Holy Spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Christology may have
some flexibility in that Christ as person redeems us from tradition and the
rigidity of law. He “redeems” us in these ways because he opens up to us the
full range of positive expression. He left the heavenly realm to inhabit the
physical—a most extraordinary demonstration of flexibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Emphasizing character
and behavior relative to God makes Christological issues less rigid than they
have sometimes been treated in church history. We probably cannot understand,
say, how divine spirit differs from angelic spirit (if it does differ in any
way but authority and ability). We wonder whether the same might be said about
modern examples of Arianism. There is a truth here, but honest error on it may
not make the system unworkable as long as it retains the human sinlessness of
Jesus Christ and the other characteristics scripture clearly attributes to him.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>These concessions for
the sake of Christian unity, however, have to keep certain safeguards in mind.
There is (a) the difference between fellowship and leadership as well as (b) the
difference between honest error and fomenting division by trying to promote
that belief in the body (note Romans <b>16</b>:17). (c) It takes both sides of
the disagreement to maintain relationship. There is a self-cleansing process when
the variance is too great for practical purposes, as John noted in 1 John <b>2</b>:18-19:
<i>“They went out from us because they were not of us.” </i>For practical
purposes, groups that differ significantly may find themselves grouping
separately and relating on occasion to the extent of common ground.            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Finally, comments here
assume that the leadership and the majority of the fellowship occupy the
dominant ground. When that is not the case, not much can be done but maintain
lines of communication and keep motives and attitude from impacting the
situation any more than necessary. What applies to Christology applies all the
more to less central features of the faith. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>From this point, then,
the study needs to move on to the information that clarifies the deity of Jesus
Christ, as presented elsewhere in these essays.</span></p>
