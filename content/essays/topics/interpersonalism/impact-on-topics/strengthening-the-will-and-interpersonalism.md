<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Will is an aspect of people
that links mind, emotion, and action to create what we call “person.” In
addition to other factors, personal relationships impact the will, the mind,
and the emotions to produce action. Will contrasts from stimulus-response; so we
are more than a set of complicated electro-chemical processes. We can decide;
we do not have to respond to the strongest environmental stimulus. Since we can
decide, we find ourselves living by values more than by drives and stimuli. We
are not the determined creatures depicted by Skinnerian behaviorism, but persons
created in the image of God. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Other people greatly
enhance our motivation to endure suffering, cope with temptation, master the
body, grow in the faith. <u>Love</u> from other people has a particularly
strong effect because love combines emotion, mind, and values into one
experience. When we can <u>trust</u> others, we are willing to try and try
again. People exhort other people with their <u>words</u> (Hebrews <b>13</b>:22).
Francis Bacon said, <i>“Rhetoric functions to harness reason to imagination for
the better moving of the will.”</i> Other people’s <u>examples</u> of
commitment inspire us to greater achievement (Philippians <b>1</b>:14). Jesus used
<u>encouragement</u> by other people when he sent out the Twelve and the Seventy
in pairs. <u>Fellowship</u> with other people and <u>prayer</u> to God combine
two dimensions of interpersonal relationship <i>“for the better moving of the
will.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonal
motivation has greater potential than motivation based on any other source. Things
cannot fully satisfy persons.  Since personal relationship answers to all the
potentials persons have, it has greater power than lesser things do—money and
things money can buy--even ideas. Understanding comes from ideas, but
exhortation comes from ideas imbedded in someone we respect. Love is the best
motivator. Love as acceptance is related to the “home court advantage.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Lesser sources of
motivation include fear. Fear applies to binary formats like those present in
legal and conceptual structures. Fear predominates in these, because if people are
not right or completely right, the only alternative is for them to be wrong, which
has penalties people fear. Fear of failure produces the adverse effect, because
it causes lower quality of performance (cp. a clutch foul shot in basketball)
or frustrates a person so much that she quits or will not even try. When fear,
fear of failure, or fear of rejection is removed, the level and consistency of
performance rises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The <i>“bondage of the
will”</i> we do not explain as the result of hereditary natural depravity. The
pull of sin does not have the character of natural inability, but ingrained
habit. People are hardened by the deceitfulness of sin (Hebrews <b>3</b>:13). Influence,
not miracle, provides satisfactory assistance for breaking the power of past
behavior on present resolve. (See notations about empowerment under the
interpersonal essay “Holy Spirit.”)</span></p>
