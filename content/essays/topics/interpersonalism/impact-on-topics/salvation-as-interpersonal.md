<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Problem</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Christianity analyzes
the human predicament as stemming from faulty personal relationship, which in
turn stems from improper personal behavior. A great amount of suffering in the
world comes from inappropriate social activity. So we cannot expect the answer
to our condition to be a chemical, scientific, materialistic, or miraculous
solution. As a result, Christianity does not attempt to solve the problem of our
human predicament in the same realm, through the same means, or by the same
method the world tries to use. It is not primarily by <u>science</u> or
scientific technology that we raise the quality of life. It is not primarily
through <u>political</u>, <u>military</u>, or <u>legal</u> <u>processes</u>
that we achieve peace and happiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Nature of Salvation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Salvation is primarily
reconciliation. Lostness means alienation, estrangement, and separation from
God and other people. Salvation reverses that condition. Reconciliation is a
Pauline imagery for restoring fellowship between persons (Romans<b> 5</b>:10-11;
2 Corinthians<b> 5</b>:18-20; Ephesians <b>2</b>:14-18; <b>4</b>:14-16;
Colossians <b>1</b>:19-23).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sin means action
resulting from a personal choice that breaks relationship between persons. Sin
is <u>anti</u>-social behavior. It is egocentric action that bespeaks a negative
type of individualism. Egocentrism behaves in I-it fashion in an I-you
circumstance. It manipulates and coerces by physical force, economic duress, subliminal
manipulation, emotional pressure in a way that bypass the <u>will</u> of
another. Sin does not <u>care</u> for the welfare of others, only for itself; it
denies the interpersonal matrix. Sin is not a kind of substance or a defect in
the form of substance. Sin is an act that causes a state of relationship. <u>Original
sin</u>, as used in historical theology, is set aside because sin is an action
not a hypostatic state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Guilt and its
consequences cannot transfer from one person to another. An act cannot transfer
from one person to another, so the guilt for an act cannot transfer nor can the
penalty for that act. Guilt is not transferable because it arises from an act
relative to a standard for action. Sin as a personal affront to another cannot
create alienation with third parties not involved in the disobedience. Legal
transfer of guilt is foreign to the nature of an interpersonal situation. <u>Original
guilt</u> is therefore set aside as well because sin is personal action toward
other persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sources of Sin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sin is transmitted <u>socially</u>
from one generation to the next rather than biologically through fallen nature.
There is (1) sinful example, misunderstood good example, social pressure, and
social reinforcement. Sin consists also in (2) the failure to transcend our <u>viewpoint
of consciousness</u> and to live interpersonally by projecting our consciousness
over behind the eyes of the other person. Finally, sin comes from (3) <u>pervertible
bodily drives</u>—pervertible by meeting them in inappropriate ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sin <i>vs</i>. the Imputation of Sin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is one thing to sin;
it is another to have it held against us. One reason God might not “impute” sin
is <b>(a)</b> that the disobedience occurred in ignorance. Right intent should
connect with right action, but two possibilities exist: right outer action
issuing from wrong inner motivation and right motivation leading to wrong
action. Ignorance is the connector between good motives and bad actions. Education
(evangelism) can remove that impediment (Acts <b>17</b>:30-31). Interpersonalism
comes into the picture in distinction to the law itself. Sincere ignorance may
justify not imputing a sin to us or at least holding it in abeyance until we
can learn better. Such ignorance does not include deliberate ignorance or
ignorance due to disinterest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Removal of Sin via Repentance and Forgiveness</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism means
that practical righteousness can be the case despite past deliberate failure
and sin. We have already said that <u>action from ignorance</u> can be
sufficient reason to disregard the act in considering someone righteous. Now we
observe that <b>(b)</b> even when the misbehavior did not stem from ignorance,
righteousness unto relationship can still exist through repentance and
forgiveness. The past cannot be undone, but the problem is not the past but the
present. If persons do not allow past conduct to affect present associations,
righteousness unto relationship can exist. Repentance plus forgiveness removes
the past from impacting the present. Repentance-forgiveness makes up the
difference between performance and perfection. Repentance separates sinners
from their past act as far as the offending parties are concerned. Forgiveness
separates sinners from their past act as far as the offended parties are
concerned. If the past no longer affects present association, sinners are
righteous for all practical purposes: they have righteousness in effective—friendship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In addition to <u>action
from ignorance</u> and <u>the repentance-forgiveness process</u>, <b>(c)</b> <u>identification
with Christ</u> stands between the sinner and righteousness unto relationship. Jesus
Christ possessed in the human situation the full righteousness the Father prescribed
for him. By carrying to the point of suffering violent death his own obedience
to Father, he qualified himself to be appointed by the Father as the object of
identification for our being viewed as righteous like him (Acts <b>17</b>:31).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Atonement</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Among New Testament
passages on atonement, Hebrews speaks extensively on the inadequacy of the
Mosaic provision for the forgiveness of sins (objective) and the cleansing of
conscience (subjective). The blood of bulls and goats cannot take away human sins
(<b>10</b>:4). The Hebrew writer does not simply affirm that point by prophetic
or <u>apostolic authority</u>; he couches his presentation in terms supplied
from the Old Testament <u>scripture</u> in Psalm <b>40</b>:6-8. Additionally,
the lack of efficacy in animal sacrifice comes from <u>the nature of the case</u>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The nature of the case
brings up the interpersonal character of what must happen for atonement to be
made possible in principle and to occur in specific cases. One deficiency was
the failure to recognize that solving interpersonal problems must be by
interpersonal means. <b>(a)</b> Animals are not <u>persons</u> so using them
does not fit with the problem of alienation between persons. The author also observes
in <b>2</b>:14-18 that Christ did not provide angels with salvation, but people
(<i>“seed of Abraham”</i>); and so Christ partook of the same condition for
appropriateness sake (<i>“behooved”</i>) as well as for helping human persons
identify with him (<i>“able to help”</i>). Animals are not moral beings, much
less sinless ones. Amoral things cannot solve moral problems; a bar of soap
cannot cleanse sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Furthermore, <b>(b)</b>
animal sacrifice was not <u>voluntary</u>. In contrast, the Messiah <i>“offered
himself”</i> (<b>9</b>:25-26). Finally, <b>(c)</b> animal sacrifice was not <u>interpersonal</u>.
It operated in legal fashion. That is the only reason animal sacrifice could
have anything to do with cleansing. Law can be foreign to the nature of things
and still work because the authority of law can say so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Theory of the Atonement</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Identification is the
mechanism by which sinful people connect with the righteous Messiah. People are
viewed as righteous, not because they are righteous, but because they have
identified themselves with him who is righteous, thereby showing their concern to
have what they do not fully achieve. Their aspiration for righteousness finds
expression in their being drawn to the Righteous One, committing themselves to
him and to his values and purposes, giving him their allegiance in contrast to
all parallel possibilities, and sensing nearness and oneness with him. Identification
means liking the same things, wanting to be around the other person, spending
time together, thinking what the other person wants and does. Identification
means resembling the other person in attitude, mannerisms, habits, and actions.
Identification with Christ carries all these same implications plus accepting
his lordship in our lives because he is greater than we are and because he is
our creator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>One indication that the
atonement does not literally turn on the penal substitution principle seems
implied by Romans <b>4</b>:25. Jesus was delivered up for our trespasses and
raised for our justification. Substitution theory considers the <u>death</u> of
Christ the discrete replacement for what should have been our own death. How is
it that the resurrection can have anything to do with justification if that was
accomplished in the death? The resurrection is not a substitute for anything. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It may be thought of as
the flip side of death, but resurrection only brings us back from what death took.
Resurrection might be said to prove that his death had the meaning Jesus
predicted it would have—basis for salvation. But that idea makes resurrection
evidence for the meaning of the death; Paul evidently speaks of it as part of
the meaning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It seems more likely
that resurrection contributes to justification by preserving Jesus in the
category of humanity really and psychologically. We can more easily identify
with him since he is resurrected man. Identifying with Christ to the point of
violent death is the most we can give to God. Christ’s resurrection brings back
before our eyes the One with whom we have to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Atonement and salvation
occur in the mind of God as a change in the way he regards us. It is not a
transfer of righteousness from Christ to us nor a transfer of guilt from us to
him. He is not a penal substitute for sinners. Rather, he is the one we
identify with, which in this case means committing ourselves to <u>him</u> because
he is the One who embodies the values we agree to live by. If we are willing to
do that, God is willing to view us as like him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Scope of the atonement</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism
affects the scope of the atonement because it is not natural for a caring,
personal God arbitrarily to choose some and condemn others irrespective of any
act on their part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Nature of Grace-Faith</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The salvation process requires
input from both God and us, because personal relationships can be established, condemned,
and restored only by acts on both sides of them. If the salvation “problem”
were something besides a personal relationship, it might be that we could solve
it alone. If we were “lost” in the woods, we might be able to “save” ourselves
by finding a way out on our own. If we were sick, we might figure out a way to
heal ourselves. If the problem were poverty, we might discover a way to work our
way out of it. But <u>this</u> problem involves two parties. It is not established
by God alone as in “recognition” (Calvinism) nor by us alone as in merit
(Phariseeism); yet action is involved contrary to antinomianism (Gnosticism). Not
saving ourselves does not mean that <u>we cannot do something</u>, but that our
doing something does not save us. Not saving ourselves also does not mean that <u>we
cannot do anything outward</u>, but that we cannot <u>by ourselves</u> do anything
inward or outward that saves us. We cannot save ourselves before God because it
takes willing actions on both sides of a relationship to restore it, and
because the offended party is the only one acting in the finalizing the restoration.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As grace summarizes God’s
action in reconciliation, faith summarizes our part in the process. God is
gracious to do it; we can only trust him to do it. Faith occurs in an
interpersonal context and so refers to an interpersonal act: <u>trust</u>. Faith
means more than intellectual assent, or <u>belief</u>. Faith does not
particularly mean <u>something inner</u> <i>vs</i>. something outer. Faith includes
the expression of it—active faith. Faith involves a non-causal connection
between action and result; it is an act toward another who considers it an
appropriate basis (condition) for giving a result that the act itself did not
produce in whole or in part. <u>We behaviorally trust him who graciously
promises to give what our behavior cannot cause</u>. Faith has the character of
<u>conditionality</u>. It refers to the principle of trust in another to give
what we cannot earn. While sinners’ actions cannot <u>cause</u> their
righteousness in the eyes of the other, they can serve as <u>conditions</u> for
considering them righteous in the eyes of the other. A trust situation includes
a second person who stands in the gap between our act and the desired effect. The
connector between our acts and those results is the <u>choice</u> of the other
person, not the authority of law, the force of nature, or the logic of ideas. In
logic, authority, and force no second person contributes to the process; so they
do not involve the interpersonal element distinctive to faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What acts apply to
reconciliation is determined by <u>appropriateness</u> and <u>need</u>. With
choice connecting act and consequence, there is more “play” in the interpersonal
system than there is in nature, law, and logic; yet the requirements are not
arbitrary, as they could be under law. The full significance of the act does
not rest in the act itself (its nature) nor in the intention of the doer, but
also in the one who stipulates the act as a condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Inner <i>vs</i>. outer
factors cannot really be separate—only analytically in the mind. So, inner action
cannot be the condition contemplated aside from overt expression of it. Besides,
inner and outer actions interact reciprocally as outer reinforces inner that
leads to visible action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The salvation provision
by God and the nature of response by people comprise the two central aspects of
soteriology as reconciliation. Interpersonalism characterizes each individually
and both conjointly. In the atonement, <u>identification</u> provides the mechanism—theory
of the atonement—of connection between Christ’s righteousness and our
righteousness unto relationship. Here stands <u>grace</u>. A person serves as
the object of identification, and persons can identify with that other Person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the application of
salvation, <u>conditionality</u>—as distinguished from causality, recognition,
and antinomianism—hinges on the presence of another person. Here stands <u>faith</u>,
where a person stands in the gap between our acts and the bestowed result. Salvation
does not involve antinomianism or recognition, which partakes of the legal
category; nor does it involve causality, which belongs to the category of
nature. Salvation is interpersonal through and through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism
clarifies why salvation cannot be by works. It takes actions on both sides to
recreate a relationship. “Works” in Paul means works of law, where they
themselves produce righteousness in contrast to having righteousness reckoned
to them as in interpersonal contexts. Under law, works are impersonal actions inasfar
as they relate to an ideal standard rather than an ideal person. In such a
context, people do them to create merit more than to please a person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Goodness is
interpersonal goodness. It is not simply a goodness people have, but a goodness
they are viewed as having. Goodness is in the person; but more importantly for
relationship purposes, goodness is in the eyes of the beholder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Works</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> may refer to the behavior patterns required by an
abstract standard. Interpersonalism regards the standard as the will of one
person for another unto relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Viewing salvation as
interpersonal rather than legal gives a feel for how, and in what sense,
salvation is a <u>process more than a point</u>. A formal act can focalize into
a point what is really a process. Societies generate rites of passage to help
people conceptualize where they are. They generate rituals to focalize
intangible matters. For that reason, baptism, for example, is more for the
candidate than for God, because it gives the person something to focalize the
process at. The friendship itself, however, is more a matter of degree than of
category. That is not to say that interpersonal process can have no time-when’s.
There is a time of decision within the person, and there is a time when the
person overtly commits himself to another—say in a handshake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Asking at what point
God begins to consider someone righteous may reflect a legal mentality because legal
transactions occur at points in time. Entering a relationship, nevertheless, may
involve a “break point,” or “conversion point,” a conviction point and a
commitment point, a handshake, a statement of apology, <i>etc.</i> Whether God
begins to consider someone saved in the living room or later as that person
comes out of the baptistry is not a highly important issue to settle since God
knows ahead of time that the believer will be coming up out of the baptistry
later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Besides being something
of a process, salvation also involves a <u>process more than a sequence</u>. Persons
can integrate the subsequent with the previous and use the previous to qualify
the subsequent. Persons have memory of the past, intention for the future, and
attitude toward other persons in the present; so they can break down sheer sequence.
Law, logic, and nature, however, are helplessly sequential in unalterable ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism provides
a way of answering the question of how many sins it takes to knock a person out
of salvation. That objection to apostasy poses a quantitative question for a
qualitative problem. First, in friendships and marriage there comes a “point,”
we say, when the friendship breaks off or the spouse is no longer willing to
continue in the marriage. Neither the friend nor the spouse would have
indicated how many sins would cause the decision to end the relationship, but
there does “come a time” when it ends. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The time comes because
the offended person decides that enough insensitive acts have happened to
indicate the attitude that caused them. It is not so much the number of acts
but the underlying attitude they represent that causes the other party to
dissolve the association. It will take some general number of such behaviors,
but the qualitative attitude rather than the quantitative number forms the
basis for judgment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonal relationships
are by nature reversible. To guarantee <u>perseverance of the saints</u>, there
would have to be a pre-empting of the will, which is a requirement for
personhood. Denying free will reduces a person to a stimulus-response organism
and adopts impersonal determinism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Eternal security</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> is also not acceptable because it becomes a kind of
antinomianism. Making behavior irrelevant to relationship does not conform to

style='font-size:12.0pt'> of salvation exists in the apostasy model more than
in either perseverance or eternal security, even though much of the argument
for these other two viewpoints comes from their supposed superior guarantee of
assurance. If in the perseverance model people turn aside from the Christian
life, their conversion experience was not genuine, or it would have lasted. Such
a proposal welds together the present condition and the final state. Since people
cannot know their future condition, they cannot now have full assurance of present
salvation because they cannot now have full assurance of future faithfulness. Ontic
regeneration provides the foundation for conversion, which ties salvation
status to a kind of being and thereby undercuts assurance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But when assurance
occurs in interpersonal terms, it rests on the <u>personal character</u> of God
as loving us (Romans <b>8</b>:32), willing that all should be saved (2 Peter <b>3</b>:9),
and being constant and trustworthy (Hebrews<b> 6</b>:17-18). It rests on his <u>promise</u>
to protect from overwhelming temptation (1 Corinthians <b>10</b>:13) and from
Satanic conquest (John <b>10</b>:28-29) as well as his promise to empower (1
Corinthians <b>10</b>:13) and guide (2 Peter<b> 1</b>:3). We develop
expectations natural to the relationship instead of expectations like perfect
health or privileged wealth. Our post-conversion weaknesses, failures, and sins
do not destroy us, because we understand that relationships do not dissolve
over one sin, especially when the repentance-forgiveness process continues. We
deal qualitatively in attitude, aspirations, and intents of the heart rather
than quantitatively in perfectionist and legal terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism helps clarify
the meaning of “deliberate sin” and what the scripture says is unforgivable. Every
act we perform is deliberate to some degree. But a deliberate act can be later
reconsidered and repented of. The present, not the past, dictates present
relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jesus spoke to the
Pharisees about a son who refused to obey but later repented. When the son
refused, he knew he was doing so. It was deliberate but later forgiven. The
opposite of deliberate sin, then, is not being ignorant that we are sinning,
even though the term “deliberate” could mean that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Blasphemy of the Holy
Spirit and other expressions about terminal sin must refer to a degree of “hardenedness”
that from a practical standpoint influence can no longer touch. If Spirit is
associated with interpersonalism, that would fit nicely. The hardened legalist
and the hardened sinner get to the point where “you can’t reason with them,”
“you can’t talk to them.” During Jesus’ ministry the Pharisees’ speaking a word
against him meant they were not convinced about who he was. But after
sufficient evidence had come and the witness of the resurrection had been
confirmed by the continuation and growth of the Messianic movement after his
crucifixion, there came a “time” when opportunity was cut off individually—and
in this case nationally at A.D. 70.</span></p>

Calvinistic <u>regeneration</u> consists of a supernatural operation of the
Holy Spirit in initial justification, so entire sanctification consists of a second
supernatural operation of the Holy Spirit in eradicating the last vestiges of
inbred sin. As a result, a person has been fully restored to the pristine

different from the admonition to take up Christ’s yoke because it is easy and his
burden is light (Matthew <b>11</b>:30). Peter tells the Jews that the Law was a
yoke that neither they nor their fathers could bear (Acts <b>15</b>:10). Paul
warns the Galatians against beginning in grace and then reverting to the yoke of
bondage that the Law is (Galatians <b>5</b>:1). The contrast to all that is
grace (Acts <b>15</b>:9-11) and a learning of <u>me</u> (Matthew <b>11</b>:29-30).
If perfection were the case, there would be objection to Galatianism and 1 John
<b>1</b>:7-10 would have no reason to speak about <i>“the blood of Jesus
cleansing us from all sin,”</i> a comment directed to Christians. Rather than
return to a prospect of perfectionism, we continue by faith and grace.</span></p>

provided the mechanisms of salvation in Calvin’s thinking—in keeping with the
fact that he first trained as a lawyer before he became a theologian. Legal
inclusion in Adam who sinned causes God to regard all people as sinners
likewise. The atonement consists of penal substitution. Selection of whom to
save occurs without reference to anything in the persons saved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Augustine, Calvin, Jonathan
Edwards, and others have conceptualized the conversion process in terms of
nature, law, and idea, which are different kinds of processes from
interpersonal process. At best, those other three processes are only analogous
to salvation. According to theologians like these, lostness is legally
determined by all people’s inclusion in Adam who sinned. Atonement is legally
accomplished by substituting Christ for Adam. The fallen nature all people biologically
inherited from Adam is regenerated miraculously so the proclamation about that
salvation through Christ can be applied to the individual. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But being lost is a social
condition, so being saved must be a social process. Lostness is alienation;
salvation is reconciliation. The nature of the solution must correspond to the
nature of the problem. These thinkers are right that from a practical
standpoint something happens parallel to, and in addition to, the proclamation
before it our accepting it. The problem is that they supernaturalize that added
something and invoke legal process to determine who would benefit from it. Instead
of <u>supernatural miracle</u> (hypostatic action) and <u>legal process</u>, <u>interpersonal
influence</u> issues from persons parallel to proclamation and helps create
readiness to accept the proclaimed message.</span></p>

Paul does cite Exodus <b>19</b>:11, <i>“I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy.”</i> Paul cited it to remind his readers that God is not a genie in a
lamp who automatically fulfills people’s desires. Their requests pass through his
sovereign will. It is a principled, interpersonal process that takes place
between them, and God is the leading person in that process. Rather than saying
that people have no will or that they have no will in salvation, the passage
say that <u>God</u> has one, an overriding one. Proposals of someone like Moses
do not manipulate God. As a result, the Jews should not suppose they have a
right to think that God’s promises to them eliminate broadening his promises to
Gentiles or that God has no right to determine what he meant when he made those
promises to Israel. His promises to Israel were positive, not restrictive</span></p>
