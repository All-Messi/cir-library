<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If interpersonalism
characterizes the Christian worldview, it follows that any deviation in its
formulation is likely some departure from personal relationship as its most
basic, central, decisive feature. It is instructive to survey the history of
the church to see how it has departed. The departures have been into one of the
other major categories or some combination of them, a prioritizing of something
else over interpersonalism, or a reduction from the full set of factors in interpersonalism.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The four basic categories are law,
nature, ideas, interpersonalism, each process driven by different mechanisms. Law
is driven by authority; what happens takes place because the law has the right
to say so. <u>Nature</u> is driven by forces. <u>Idea</u> as metaphysics is
driven by form. <u>Interpersonalism</u> is driven by influence. Below are
examples of “de-interpersonalizing” the Christian worldview and its message.
They become examples of how interpretation gets impacted by the failure to keep
the interpersonal category as primary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            1. Legalizing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Included here are all things
moved forward by authority. The <u>clergy</u> concept has a set of usages like the
<u>confessional</u>, which lifts James<b> 5</b>:16 and other passages out of
their interpersonal setting and recasts them in a legal framework. The
absolution of personal guilt passes from the omniscient God to fallible people.
More to the point, a sin is against the friend harmed and against “Heaven,”
where the definition of “harm” originated (Luke <b>15</b>:18, 21). People can
forgive sins done against them personally, and “Heaven” can forgive a breach of
divine expectancy between people; but no basis exists for third parties to
forgive; the law of the harvest disallows it. Cause and consequence must have
the same kind: grapes cannot come from thorns nor figs from thistles (Matthew <b>7</b>:16).
Only by the authority of law would such a possibility become plausible, but we
deny that there is any reason to believe that God has given such authority to an
official representative—Matthew<b> 16</b>:18-20; <b>18</b>:18 to the contrary
notwithstanding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The Twelve were probably
thinking in legal terms when they forbade the <u>unknown miracle worker</u>
because he was not traveling along with them. They supposed he had no right to
do them because he was not part of their appointed group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The doctrine of <u>eternal
security</u> (as distinct from perseverance of the saints) treats salvation as
a legal status by making it like a high school diploma—once granted, ever had. Though
graduates may forget most everything they learned getting it, they have <i>“the
rights and privileges that pertain thereunto.”</i> It becomes salvation gone awry
when people claim salvation status without salvation commitments. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The doctrine of <u>original
guilt</u> means that all people, by virtue of legal inclusion under Adam, share
the guilt his category (humankind) possesses—federal man as Augustine conceived
of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Because baptism is a
formal act, it has picked up several legal concepts. In a longstanding
tradition, <u>baptism for the forgiveness of original sin</u> becomes a legal
act by which racial sin is removed. The baptism is efficacious because of the legitimacy
of its administrator. A special <u>administrator</u> of the sacraments, duly ordained,
must perform them to guarantee efficacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The doctrine of <u>apostolic
succession</u> means that the validity of official administration derives from
receiving the office from someone duly authorized all the way back to the
official apostles themselves, particularly Peter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  <u>Baptism as a sign
of an external covenant</u> is another legal conceptualization of the
ordinance. It regards baptism as bringing the candidates into the church in an
institutional sense. Baptism identifies people with the visible church and
stands aside from a direct salvation connection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Basing salvation on <u>physical
descent</u> applies legal—along with physical connections. The legal comes in
by stipulating that children of the presumptively elect have ecclesiastical
privilege—as in the right to baptism even if only one parent has church
membership (half-way covenant). John the Baptist warned against such thinking
among his Jewish contemporaries (Matthew<b> 3</b>:9); there is no people of
God—Israel or church—aside from spiritual factors alone; spiritual means
interpersonal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Selling <u>indulgences</u>
scandalized Martin Luther and helped prod him to lead a reformation
characterized by returning to a more interpersonal understanding of the
Christian faith as by faith alone (<i>vs</i>. faith plus works). The idea of
selling the right to commit sin contradicts the very nature and purpose of the
gospel: restoring people’s relationship to God broken by such sins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  By legal authority, <u>treasury
of the saints</u> unnaturally transfers actions and their effects from one
person to another. Supposedly, ancient saints like the apostles did more than
necessary for their own salvation, and their “extras” (supererogation) became a
repository from which others could draw who have fewer works than they need. That
perversion combines legal process with a quantifying mentality. (It also makes
a fuzzy connection with degrees of heavenly reward. How could there be
leftovers from the saints’ highest status from living perfectly?) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The doctrine of <u>penance</u>
envisions the substitution of later prescribed excess works for earlier
deficiencies, or some unrelated effort to make up for significant sin. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Legalizing the Christian
system includes other items like the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (a) The legal mind tends
to treat all matters as equally important. Items do not get arranged in a
central-to-less-central format, primary-secondary, preliminary-ultimate. The
thinking becomes binary: true or not; stated in the Bible or not. The only
differentiation lies in the severity of the punishment or in a distinction
between venial (forgivable) and moral sin (unforgivable).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (b) Legality fosters
inflexibility and rigidness that disregards the complexity in living situations
due to intent and motive, repentance or hardened attitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (c) Legality operates
more in terms of measurable and therefore overt acts. Qualitative matters like
motive and attitude get eclipsed by quantification. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (d) Law does not
correct the consequences of a breach of the law without exacting penalty—even
if a person is repentant and even if the penalty has to be done somehow by
someone else, thus the penal substitution theory of the atonement.
Interpersonal process can simply forgive without exacting recompense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (e) Law cannot in
theory allow for, or affirm, alternatives not specified in the legislation,
which interpreters tend to read restrictively rather than non-restrictively. Silence
therefore more easily becomes prohibition—not just by the nature of the case,
but by its absence from the law: there has to be positive “justification” for
alternatives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (f) Law does not have
to reflect the nature of the situation. Unlike interpersonalism, law can be
artificial, contrived, approximate, even contrary to the nature of reality, but
still be valid, authoritative, and in effect. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (g) Law stresses the
relatively small percent of lack in perfection instead of appreciating the
large percent of achievement, development, and progress. It fosters frustration
and a negative feeling about what we have <u>not</u> done. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (h) Law tends to deal with
quantitative factors rather than qualitative ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  (i) All the issues
that have arisen over the distinction between the Mosaic Law and Christian gospel
belong under this legalizing heading. In the New Testament itself, we find
controversy over <u>circumcision</u> because Jewish Christians conceived of as permanence
the Mosaic Law and the Jewish Nation as a political entity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the history of the
church, another disorienting factor was <u>uniting church and state</u> from
the time of Constantine up through the Majesterial Churches of the Reformation
period in Europe and beyond. <u>The Crusades</u> offer another manifestation of
the notion that there is a political dimension of the church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Sabbatarianism</u> continues
into the present because some Christians the Jewish Sabbath a memorial of the
creation rather than the exodus. The Sabbath was not observed before, outside,
or after the Jewish nation because God instituted it as a sign between himself
and Israel (Exodus <b>31</b>:12-17; Deuteronomy <b>5</b>:12-<u>15</u>). See that
point elaborated in the document “A Rationale for the Structure of Genesis 1.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In the previous
strictures on legalism, we have in mind matters where the whole is
characterized by legal procedure with perhaps other add-ons. We agree that in
other settings “legal” can be employed to refer to an objective “standard” for
human behavior. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            2. Institutionalizing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Institutionalization
attempts to imbed the Christian faith in an organizational system and to
conceive of its operations as occurring through the authority flow in that
system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            3. Quantifying</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The practice of <u>penance</u>
fosters the quantifying mentality by specifying a special endeavor to offset a
previous sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            4. Misinterpreting</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  In interpretation we
must not (1) abstract scripture from the person who speaks in it as a primary
element of context, (2) forget that written expression is still the expression
of the Person behind it, (3) fail to remember that the author’s intention sets
the content in proper interpretation, and (4) tend to read statements
restrictively and literally without allowing non-restriction and figurative as
something to consider. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            5. Ontologizing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Nature is “unforgiving”
when someone acts contrary to it. It cannot change from be to become. Augustine
of Hippo provided Western Christianity with a thoroughgoing attempt to base
Christian theology in the ontic category. In so doing, he reflected a pattern
already prominent in Christian thought, which issued in many practices and
leading to several major controversies as witnessed below. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The ontologizing
tendency in historical theology appears in the <u>doctrine of the real presence</u>
(impanation, metousiosis, transubstantiation, consubstantiation) in the
Eucharist. The biblical point is not to eat actual flesh and blood of God’s
Son, but to intimately associate with him, committed to him, and live like him
whose flesh and blood the emblems represent and whose character is expressed in
full obedience to God’s will for a person’s life. Ingesting these symbols
pictures internalizing his values.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The doctrine of <u>natural
depravity</u> (original sin as distinguished from original guilt) had
far-reaching implications for Christian thought as that doctrine attempted to
explain natural evil as well as moral evil in terms of fallen ontic substance
in humankind. “Total depravity” posited that the sins of our first parents led
to a depravitizing consequence biologically inheritable in a way that all spiritual
aspects—though not in complete degree—of each human person is weakened to the
point that no one can respond to the gospel without supernatural enablement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A corresponding
doctrine that corrects natural depravity is supernatural <u>regeneration</u>—for
some or all people, depending on the formulation. That divine act enables a
person to respond—or necessarily respond—to the salvation message. Added to
that, the doctrine of the <u>second definite work of grace</u> enables the
regenerate convert to live the sinless life of love. <u>Baptismal regeneration</u>
connects with “water regeneration,” which may go beyond removal of guilt to
removal of inability—even from infants and even prenatally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  From a different
direction, Albert Schweitzer represented the ontologizing tendency in
philosophical ethics when he tried to put the essence of good in the notion of <u>reverence
for life</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The doctrine of <u>perseverance
of the saints</u> (as distinct from eternal security) assumes the <u>irresistibility
of grace</u>. Guaranteeing success at remaining faithful to the end would suppose
such things as stimulus-response, miraculous regeneration of ontic being. In
the process free will would have to be denied. As long as free will is present,
a person can choose to refuse even though all requisite conditions are present
for the proper moving of the will. If all else fails, God can take a person’s
life to prevent backsliding far enough to enter apostasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The Christological
controversy over the two natures culminated in the Council of Chalcedon (A.D.
451) and pitted Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox constituency against Coptic
and Syriac constituencies. The argument was whether Christ—especially during
the incarnation—has one nature (divine, monophysitism) or two natures (divine
and human, dyophysitism). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Such a distinction
assumes that divine and human are <u>both</u> hypostatic (substantive, ontic,
ontological). We do not know from revelation or experience the hypostatic
nature of spirit generally—except that “spirit” (or “a spirit”) does not have
flesh and blood as the resurrected Christ had before his ascension (Luke <b>24</b>:39),
much less how or whether the spirits of just people made perfect (Hebrews <b>12</b>:23)
differ from angelic spirits (good or fallen) and divine Spirit in this sense.
We do not even know how or whether the eternal state of the righteous after
they have been <i>“clothed upon/dressed”</i> (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:1-4)
differs from the intermediate state of the righteous <i>“saints under the
altar”</i> (Revelation <b>6</b>:9) or the intermediate and eternal states of
the lost. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  How can we know
whether substantia-hypostasis-ousia even applies in the realm of spirit? Could
distinctions exist, say, in rank or prerogative, a difference in the projection
of divine consciousness? How do wave and particle differ as with light, which
is said to have no “rest mass”? How does energy <i>vs</i>. matter (Einstein’s e
= mc<sup>2</sup>) relate to such questions? Is there some way to imagine a
distinction between mass, energy, wave, hypostasis, substantia, ousia that is
applicable to the assumptions of that Christological controversy? Such
speculation serves only to divide the disciples of Christ on matters that have
no teleological value; they are irrelevant to Christ’s reason for incarnating
to become our “savior.” Salvation pertains to reconciling relationships and
godly living thereunto (action). It aims to overcome alienation between
individuals, races, sexes, and social statuses (cp. 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:18-19
+ Galatians <b>3</b>:28-29). Of the three aspects of reality—being, action, and
relationship—only action and relationship have any revealed connection with the
concerns of special revelation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Another Christological
controversy was whether the Christ is of the same hypostatic nature as the
Father (homoousia) or of similar nature to him (homoiousia). The question
assumes again that with deity something is “there” to constitute the What of
deity. Does that “something” have locational omnipresence or diffuse
consciousness? Does “it” somehow have the character of thought or pattern of
action—non-ontological references? We do not want to slip into the subtle error
of reification, supposing there is a thing because there is a noun for it. If
deity is <u>super</u>natural, what can we say positively about it since we
speak only of the kinds of “stuff” we can know by experience—and perceive as
extended by instrumentation (1 Timothy <b>6</b>:16, <i>“whom no one <u>can</u>
see”</i>)? Presumably being in the realm of created nature, we cannot
experience the <u>super</u>natural; we cannot experience even all the features
of this creation—radio waves, and the like. The supernatural order(s) of being
have to “manifest” themselves to our perceptions; that means doing something to
make connection. If our understanding of the supernatural cannot be (1) by <u>perception</u>,
it must be (2) by <u>imagination</u> so the understanding of, and speech about,
the supernatural must come by <u>analogy</u> with what we <u>do</u> know. Approximate
understanding can come (a) by taking what we <u>do</u> know and <u>pushing it
to the absolute</u>—knowledge to omniscience, power to omnipotence, location to
omnipresence, temporary to eternal, goodness to perfection. Understanding can
come (b) by <u>negating the known</u>—as in aseity and sovereignty for
dependence (<i>“I am because I am.”</i>), immutability for flux, holiness for
inconsistency, spirituality for materiality, immortality for mortality,
infinite for finite. It is difficult to see how speculation about ontological
Christology affects human “faithfulness” to personal deity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  From the standpoint of
revelation, it is difficult enough to “put our finger on” what we mean by
“person” except that somehow God created us in a way that puts us <i>“in his
image</i>,<i>”</i> that is, having the interpersonal capacity so that he is not
“wholly other.” We think of personhood as a complex of functions more than a
set of genetic capacities that make those functions possible in the created realm
(cp. the mind-brain controversy). So to speak, we enter on “the second floor”
without knowing how the first floor (materiality) holds it up (operation). We
need to understand and confess only matters commandable, understandable,
believable, and obeyable unto proffered relationship and hope. We do not have
to understand a calculator to use one. All we have to confess about God is that
<i>“he <u>is</u>”</i> (however that “is-ness” is grounded, if it is “grounded”)
and <i>“that he rewards those who seek him” </i>(Hebrews <b>11</b>:6) in
fellowship because we and he are “friendable.” All these comments about
hypostasis come from supposing that only those matters with clear behavioral
correlates need be understood, carried out, agreed on, or in some cases made
matters of fellowship. Christological speculations have led to unrevealed
beliefs that have <u>divided</u> us. We affirm in principle what propositional
revelation teaches even though with supernatural matters we cannot always
distinguish the language of reality from the language of analogy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Hypostatic
speculations have added to and <u>perverted</u> revealed Christianity.
Hypostatic speculation has led to perversions of sexuality and marriage. It
exalted <u>celibacy</u> over marriage—even <u>celibacy in marriage</u> after
conversion! Out of that same speculation arose the doctrine of the <u>immaculate
conception</u> of Mary (to avoid the taint of depravity and guilt in the

Pentecostalism turn people’s minds toward miracle and the supernatural now. In
keeping with that mindset, we get in the habit of supernaturalizing our
experiences—conceptualizing them that way and verbalizing them that way. We
interpret feelings and ideas as revelation planted in our minds and hearts by
the Holy Spirit as in the interpretation of providence and in the
“interpretation of tongues.” Participants interpret the experiences of
glossolalia as a supernatural enablement to speak in unlearned languages, even
as private prayer languages differ for each person even though linguistic
analyses of the phenomenon finds no structure in it, structure being a
necessary feature of communication. </span></p>

If we conclude that our feelings and ideas do not correspond with the

that there even needed to be a specific annual day for commemorating Christ’s
resurrection much less that it had to occur relative to Passover to be valid. Apostolic
practice commemorated Christ’s resurrection weekly on the first day of the
week. Anything more need not concern us, but if for practical reasons we wanted
to observe it annually, it was not worth dividing the church over as to when.</span></p>

of as something private as if it were a matter of “me and my Jesus” or our
contemplation of God vertically without simultaneous concern for the horizontal
dimension as part of the religious experience. In practice, it fosters an
attempt to stifle the public expression of Christian faith. That procedure can
lead to egocentrism that uses religious and supernatural agency to reinforce our
own desires and to manipulate other people to our own ends. Such religion can
come closer and closer to the Eastern tendency to make the religious experience

body-spirit dualism or austere <u>asceticism</u> (stoicism) or <u>antinomianism</u>
(Epicureanism). In Gnosticism the latter acted as if the deeds of the body
cannot taint the goodness of the soul since matter and spirit are mutually
exclusive realities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Scripture answers that
outer behavior springs from inner motivation and outer behavior affects inward
motivation. Not only are inner and out compatible; they reciprocate between
each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Perhaps some reformers
were looking for the interpersonal when they revolted against the legal, which
especially characterized the degenerate state of theological method in the Medieval
Ages, the “Dark Ages.” They correlated law with the outer, which suggested
inner as the alternative. If works refer to overt action, then salvation by
faith means salvation based on internal action. But the alternative to law is
not inner (Jeremiah<b> 31</b>; “heart”) but “inter.” Externalism is not the
only correlative for legalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  When Jesus, Jeremiah,
and Paul speak of people as they are on the inside <i>vs</i>. the way they are
on the outside, they appear to be talking, not about the inner factors like
motivation, intentionality, and concern <i>vs</i>. outer actions—which in fact
express them. They mean interpersonal <i>vs</i>. legal operation. We could say
that interpersonalism does “roughly correspond” to inner factors because there
are no forms of compulsion involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The historical context
of Jesus and Paul’s ministries depended heavily on legal and physical bases for
divine relationship found in contemporary Judaism. The legal approach uses
external compulsions in contrast to internal impulsions. That is the contrast
involved in legal right based on lineage. Legally only a certain lineage could
be considered children of Abraham in the “flesh”; but any person can be a child
of Abraham in “spirit.” Naturalization into National Israel is merely analogous
to becoming <i>“a friend of </i>(someone like) God,” which is the real medium
of divine relationship—interpersonalism. <i>“Kingdom of God”</i> is a metaphor for
the realm of interpersonal relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The “covenant”
predicted in Jeremiah <b>31</b>:30-31 would internalize principles and values. <i>“Written
on the heart”</i> served as a picture for what contrasts with external matters.
Paul says the former covenant wrote its principles and values “on stone,” which
symbolically contrasts with the warm internal commitment of a caring person (“heart”)
with the cold external demands of impersonal law. “A heart of stone” means a
heart unmoved by compassion. The Law ends up getting psychologically abstracted
from the One who gave it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  If Jesus, Jeremiah,
Habakkuk, and Paul spoke of inner when they placed the positive alternative
over against law, presumably what makes Christianity tick are not legal
mechanisms. The appropriate alternatives are <u>spirit</u> (<i>vs</i>. flesh), <u>faith</u>
(<i>vs</i>. law/merit/works), <u>love</u> (<i>vs</i>. fear), <u>intent</u>/attempt
(<i>vs</i>. success/accomplishment/perfection/ righteousness), <u>interpersonal</u>
(<i>vs</i>. various impersonal media like law, nature, and ideas).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The last three
alternatives are not the essence, but they can be involved with it. Nature is
used, but not as a means of solution. Idea is involved by being used to convey
to another the referent to which it points. Law is involved in positive
commandments regarding ritual and structure transcended by the will of God and
his concern for us, for our well-being, and for our harmonious association with
him as personal deity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  We warn against
attempting to reduce salvation to quantifiable matters, mechanisms, and
statements. Some evangelicals try to meet that requirement by talking about the
inner factor as what faith is in its soteriological, Pauline usage. To those
who argue that outward action is included as parts of the conditions for
salvation, the typical query is posed of how many outward expressions are
needed to meet the condition for salvation. The query automatically equates
outward with quantifiable. We could also pose that question about internal
matters: what has to be believed (what)? How strong does the faith have to be
(degree)? Some attempt to avoid these questions by labeling all human responses—inner
or outer—as soteriologically <i>post facto</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  For our own part, we
have said that faith must be to the degree of producing outer action, and that
the satisfactory degree of outer action is one that is growing. Interpersonalism
brings that all into focus in establishing, improving, and regulating social
relations. The growing degree in normal associations causes other people to
exercise patience as long as they have hope based on that improvement. Attitude,
caring, willingness to listen and repent are corrective because other persons
are willing to forgive the diminishing distance between performance and
perfection if the first person shows concern to minimize that distance.</span></p>
