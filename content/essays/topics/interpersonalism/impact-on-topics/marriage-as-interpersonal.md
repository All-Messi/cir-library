<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Marriage is a specialized <u>interpersonal</u>
relationship. Whatever we know about personal associations in general applies
most crucially to matrimony. The products of love and the ways of expressing
and developing it apply to marriage more than anywhere else because of the
intensity and all-inclusiveness of that relationship. Marriage is primarily
interpersonal with added distinctives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Marriage involves <u>complementary</u>
relationship. The ultimate concept in marriage is oneness, not <i>sameness</i>.
Husband and wife have complementary capacities in the full range of human
personhood and complementary roles in their operation as a socio-physical unit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Marriage involves <u>interdependent</u>
relationship. The emphasis is on oneness, not <i>equality</i>. Oneness
contrasts with equality as the ultimate concept in marriage. Equality implies
two-ness, but marriage stresses the complete, permanent, and exclusive
relationship epitomized in the one flesh of Genesis <b>2</b>:23-24. Nevertheless,
men and women have equal worth because they are both persons who individually
and corporately bear the image of God in themselves and in their “married-ness.”
In their oneness they are interdependent. Paul pictures this matter by a
combination of historical and natural facts: woman was created from man and man
is born by woman (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:11-12).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Marriage involves <u>hierarchical</u>
relationship. As there is oneness and order in the trinity that forms the one
God, so also there is oneness and order in the marriage that forms the one
flesh. In all personal relationships, as much as possible happens by personal interaction
governed by love. Leadership, parenting, marriage, and other group activities
have structure added to social dynamics for the sake of good order.
Responsibilities are assigned to avoid confusion about who does what. Authority
is not appealed to unless social factors do not suffice. That order does not
affect the demeanor of the persons toward each other. They simply recognize who
is being held responsible for what. In marriage, God holds the husband
ultimately responsible for the support and success of the family, and the wife
conducts herself with that in mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The fact that interpersonal
process transcends any legal elements involved provides the key for
understanding how <i>“husband as head of wife”</i> does not demean wife any
more than <i>“Father as head of Christ”</i> demeans Christ, or <i>“parent as
head of child”</i> demeans child, or elders as head of congregation demeans
laity. “Demeaning” refers to <i>“lessening the worth and meaning of”</i> wife,
children, laity, women. The value of persons does not derive from status,
station, or ability, but from being in and acting according to the image of God,
conforming to his purpose, and fulfilling the responsibilities husband and wife
have in the corporate situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            However, as with all cases
where order overlays relationship, the responsibility is limited to matters
involved in the goals of the group. Order does not annul relationship
(Galatians <b>3</b>:7). Improperly functioning order interferes with
relationship. Respect and love do not exclude each other in marriage any more
than in parenting. As to attitude the husband operates from love: “husbands
love your wives.” The emphasis falls on love and self-giving, not order
(Ephesians <b>5</b>:25).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Unlike most personal
associations, marriage is <u>all-inclusive</u>. It calls for sharing all
aspects of each including the physical bodies. The interpersonal finds physical
expression in sexual relationship; so neither has exclusive right over his or
her own body (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:4). In a way the compenetration of
personalities bears analogy to physical relationship, tangibly reinforcing the
corporate identity experienced in this deepest of all human relationships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The priority of personhood
and the quality of personal relationship in marriage is illustrated in an
unfortunate way by the failure of marriages between physically attractive
partners, equally capable people. “Beauty is only skin deep.” Even in those
cases where the marriage fails partially because of the physical condition of
either spouse, that lack of attentiveness to physical matters—hygiene, sexual
relations, appearance—itself reflects a lack of love for the other person.</span></p>
