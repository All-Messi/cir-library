<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism highlights
the <u>importance of Christian unity</u> because (a) unifying mankind is the
very purpose of the church. In Christ, God is creating “a new united mankind”
(Ephesians <b>2</b>:14-16). What has come together <u>in him</u> must exemplify
the purpose <u>of him</u>. The importance of unity also lies in its (b)
apologetic value. Division in Christ belies the call to unity in Christ. The
credibility of the Christian calling and claim is weakened or destroyed
otherwise (John <b>17</b>: 21, 23; Luke <b>11</b>:18). The richness of the (c)
Christian experience lies specifically in the “peace” that comes from Christians
living together in harmony (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:15; cp. Romans <b>14</b>:19).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. The Nature of Christian Unity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonalism characterizes
the <u>nature of Christian unity</u> by giving it an interpersonal center. Lostness
means alienation; so salvation means reconciliation (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:18-20).
The center consists of a person rather than a set of doctrines. Jesus Christ
abolished in his flesh the <u>law of commandments contained in ordinances</u>, and
created <u>in himself</u> a new united mankind (Ephesians <b>2</b>:14-15). He
did so to give Jews and Gentiles access to the Father in one “spirit” (an
interpersonal term) through himself. The unity of the church theologically
results from individual unity with the Son. We have unity by identification, an
interpersonal process. The unity of the church behaviorally consists of the
attitude and conduct that come from love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Because of the interpersonal
nature of unity, there can be unity in diversity. Ontological and conceptual
diversity can exist as long as those natural and ideological differences do not
contradict social relations or conflict with the purposes of him who calls us
into oneness with his purposes. Interpersonalism impacts unity so much because
it transcends knowledge. Christ dwells in our hearts by faith (an interpersonal
attitude) so we may be grounded in the love that surpasses knowledge (Ephesians
<b>3</b>:17-19; cp. Philippians <b>4</b>:7). Love does not set knowledge aside,
but love does make complete knowledge and total accuracy unnecessary for
relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christian interpersonalism
allows for unity in diversity within its concept of the highest good (<i>summum
bonum</i>) because the purpose of Christian unity is not to have (a) <u>monolithic
oneness</u> as in the Eastern concept of the Ultimate One (in the ontological
category). The Christian <i>summum bonum</i> is not (b) the <u>uniform sameness</u>
of individuals, which appears to be the idea behind the extreme forms of the women’s
liberation movement. Instead, the highest good, the ultimate truth, the true
reality is (c) <u>harmonious relationship</u>: “How good and how pleasant it is
for brothers to live together in unity” (Psalm <b>133</b>:1). The other two
approaches try to place the <i>summum bonum</i> in ontic being or individual
ontic being rather than in relationships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Except in its broadest
contours, Christian unity does not consist of (d) <u>complete agreement</u>
among those related to the same Person. To know and relate to someone harmoniously
does not require exhaustive or exact knowledge about that person or that
person’s purposes. Matters that lie beyond what affects relationship and common
purposes can be incompletely and even erroneously understood. A wife may
suppose that her husband weighs fifteen pounds more than he does, but that does
not dissolve their marriage. Similarly, we can err about some doctrines without
undoing salvation, which is relationship with God. This ignorance can come from
not having received revelation or from misunderstanding revelation received—especially
revelation that does not have behavioral correlates. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Sincerity” means more than
the absence of hypocrisy. The critical element is attitude—openness to
correction, humility regarding our own ability and correctness, our “teachableness.”
Much of the doctrinal division in Christendom comes from misinterpreting the
scripture given to us about the truth. The key here is attitude, because in
interpersonal matters it is the heart that counts when all else fails. Acts <b>17</b>:30
shows that God is willing to overlook legitimate ignorance (and presumably some
mis-action based on sincere misunderstanding). Honest misinterpretation is a
form of legitimate ignorance. Sincere ignorance shows itself in willingness to
change <u>when</u> enlightenment comes and by willingness to listen <u>so</u>
enlightenment can come. Included is the willingness to <u>listen</u> to be
enlightened as well as the willingness to <u>speak</u> to enlighten other
people. God overlooks the head in looking on the heart (Acts <b>17</b>:30 + 1
Samuel <b>16</b>:7; Luke <b>16</b>:15). An interpersonal system allows some
conceptual and behavioral “slippage,” because the one person can repent and the
other can forgive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It is fortunate that
Christian unity does not require complete agreement, because the narrower the
platform the fewer that can stand on it. If unity consists in personal
relationship, the base for it is broader because people do not have to be right
about as many things. The interpersonal character of Christian unity
legitimizes not thinking about it in all-or-nothing terms, but following a
central-less central format. The issue changes to one of degrees—from whether
something is revealed or not, opinion or not, to whether it is central, less
central, or peripheral. Personal matters pre-empt conceptual ones, even as love
builds up where knowledge puffs up or as service unites and doctrine divides. Stressing
love tends toward unity; stressing doctrine tends toward division. The
flexibility of persons is greater than that of ideas (or nature, or law). Consequently,
associations built on caring are more stable than those based on being “right.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Most arguments against “sincerity
will save you” come from inappropriate comparisons. Sincerity might injure
somebody if the mechanic does not fix the car right. But social relationships
do not work the same way brakes do. Pleading ignorance to a police officer
cannot be honored because people will lie about how whether they knew the speed
limit, and the officer cannot know it is a lie. Sincerity does not make us right,
but it makes us forgivable. Sincerity does not make us right, but it lets us
become right. It does not make us right, but it allows other people to overlook
our mistakes without compromising their convictions or break friendship with us
(“lostness”). Sincerity does not change the truth, but it does change us and
the other people we try to relate to. Sincerity does not make us right, but it can
save us. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Salvation and the Christian
message about it have to do with fellowship with God (see “Revelation” in IP). That
is the reason revelation can be progressive. What was not as critically necessary
before could come later, because God can deal in other ways with those not
fully informed (see “Salvation” in IP). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            This claim turns on the idea
that friendship transcends propositional knowledge through revelation
(conscience, heart, attitude), and that same idea applies to Christian unity. God
stands above his law; otherwise, he could not judge those outside it (1
Corinthians <b>5</b>:13). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The interpersonal character
of Christian truth implies that Christian unity centers on interpersonal items.
The nature of unity implies then that (1) <u>doctrines without practical</u> <u>correlates
are not as central as those involving moral behavior</u>. Some examples might
include traducian <i>vs</i>. creationist origin of the soul, bipartite <i>vs</i>.
tripartite view of mankind, distinctions between pre-, mid-, and
post-tribulation rapture; and distinctions between pre-, post-, and
a-millennial eschatological systems. We prepare the same way for all the
eschatological formats.</span></p>

In fact, it is doubtful that the Law provided any sacrifice for the forgiveness
of murder since it was a capital crime under Mosaism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As regards relationship to
God, Paul not only entertained the possibility that God could be consistent
while saving someone who had not performed the rite of circumcision; he
directly affirms that God would overlook it: <i>“If the uncircumcised keep the
ordinance of the Law, won’t their uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?”</i>
(Romans <b>2</b>:26). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is a tendency in
Christian unity to (a) <u>confuse truthfulness with the relative</u> <u>importance
of each truth</u>. There is not just <u>opinion</u> (from insufficient
evidence) and <u>faith</u> (from sufficient evidence); there is also <u>fact</u>—things
true that are less central like formal matters and matters without behavioral
correlates. When Christ’s followers are not in denial of the facts or they are
not sure how to understand, behavioral Christian unity need not be affected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The legal mentality does not
distinguish between objective truth and subjective awareness of truth. People’s
attitude and intent to know receive no practical attention; so they are treated
the same way as someone who does not care. Such people are treated like a
statement; the only question is whether they are right. So the
subjective-objective variable in personhood is not accounted to have any value
even though that is the only variable that causes the difference. There needs
to be a distinction made between a wrongdoer and an evildoer. The difference
lies in intentionality. The fragmentation of the body of Christ does not stem
from objective truths, but from subjective failure to properly appropriate them.
It is foreign to the nature of the situation not to allow the subjective
element in personhood to impact the solution to Christian unity insofar as it
stems from honest failure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There is also a tendency to
(b) <u>confuse the place with the nature of an item of truth.</u> In regard to
Christian baptism, many have felt compelled to make believers’ immersion a test
of fellowship because baptism relates to initial salvation (the <u>place</u> of
baptism). It would be more appropriate not to make it a test of fellowship,
because it is a formal act (the <u>nature</u> of it).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Someone might object that
baptism is not a test of fellowship, but a test of church membership. But
Christian fellowship exists only between Christians. Whether inside or outside
the confines of local church membership is irrelevant. Members of one local
church have fellowship with those of another local church. It is obvious that
anyone who is a member of the universal church has a right to become a member
of any local expression of it. <u>Fellowship</u> with Christian people is the
same as considering them <u>Christians</u>. Considering people as Christians is
the same thing as considering them <u>saved</u>. Considering them as Christians
is the same thing as considering them qualified for <u>local church membership</u>.
Refusing them membership amounts to considering them unsaved. Refusing them
membership because of not agreeing that they have been baptized amounts to
considering a formal act determinative for presence in an interpersonal system.
Even more basic is the idea of local church membership itself; that practice is
what sets up the conflict between fellowship and membership in a practical
sense. There does not seem to be any New Testament basis for local church
membership. If we are going to do it, then we ought to do it in a way that does
not contradict what is more basic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Below is a compilation of
issues Paul found worth disfellowshiping for. The reason for bringing them up
in connection with Christian unity is that fellowship is coterminal with
Christian brotherhood, salvation, and the absence of church discipline. With
its view to reinstatement, church discipline involves practical correction, which
might make some difference in our application of observations. Church
disfellowship might not be tantamount to loss of salvation; yet John <b>20</b>:21-23
has been read in such a way as to make them coextensive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The interpersonal character
of Christian truth implies that the <u>method of Christian unity</u> centers on
interpersonal items and is achieved through interpersonal means. The nature of
unity establishes the method for achieving it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Denominationalism tends to follow
the creases in society. Note in this connection Richard Niebuhr’s <i>The Social
Sources of Denominationalism</i>. Since Christianity intends to unite mankind,
it attempts to achieve a classless society. Interpersonalism wages war against binary
distinctions like bond-free, married-unmarried, male-female, circumcision-uncircumcision,
rich-poor, Jew-Gentile, literate-illiterate, black-white as regards salvation
and fellowship. To whatever extent Niebuhr’s observations are true,
Christianity’s interpersonal character works against division and
denominationalism; hence, Robert Lee’s <i>The Social Sources of Church Unity</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Past approaches to Christian
unity include (a) <u>organizational oneness</u>. Roman Catholicism represents
this classification. Another method centers on (b) <u>common experience</u>. An
example would be the use of tongue speaking as a criterion for brotherhood. (c)
<u>Doctrinal agreement</u> furnishes a third approach. Erasmus based Christian
unity on a central body of doctrine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The marks of division within
the church are five in number: (1) <u>peculiar doctrines</u> (cp. 1 Corinthians
<b>1</b>:10; <b>15</b>:12); (2) <u>exclusivistic attitude</u> (1 Corinthians <b>4</b>:1);
(3) <u>distinguishing names</u> (1 Corinthians <b>1</b>:12 <i>vs</i>.<b> 3</b>:23);
(4) <u>restrictive fellowship</u>; (5) <u>separate</u> <u>organizations</u>. Doctrinal
peculiarities ostensibly lead to the last three; but as a practical matter,
exclusivistic attitude reinforcing that doctrinal peculiarity is most
responsible for developing the distinguishing names, restrictive fellowship,
and separate organizations. (a) <i>Exclusivistic</i> <i>attitude develops the
other three</i> to keep one group distinct from another. Not only is this the
case, but (b) <i>exclusivistic attitude closes the mind to the possibility of
correction </i>on doctrinal matters, and the other three follow as a matter of
course. In addition to whatever doctrinal dissimilarity exists, there is a
significant amount of psychological distance felt toward other Christian people
and groups, and that reinforces the tendency to stay separate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>             There is yet another
dynamic that can operate here. The (c)<i> exclusivistic</i> <i>attitude can
itself originate peculiar doctrines</i>. It shows itself in the desire to be different,
to say something new. The unconscious concern to distinguish oneself from other
people and their ideas sets a person up to read scripture with overkill in a
direction opposite to an opponent’s belief. Reading “the perfect” in 1
Corinthians <b>13</b>:10 as the completed New Testament canon may be prompted
by the impulse to avoid pentecostalism, even though canonicity seems far
removed from Paul’s flow of thought. Reading “husband of one wife” in 1 Timothy
<b>3 </b>and Titus <b>1</b> as requiring married elders is another example
Alexander Campbell hit on in his debate with Purcell to make Roman Catholicism
look all the more unscriptural. Sometimes the attitude creates a separate group
that spawns new doctrines. At other times the attitude creates peculiar
doctrines that spawn separate groups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, legalistic people
tend to create a legalistic god in their own image. They assume that God’s will
expressed in the Bible matches their own mentality in issuing commands and
establishing conditions. Consequently, they automatically read the statements
about such matters as having the same rigidity as they would mean them if they themselves
were issuing them. Hermeneutically they tend to take statements restrictively instead
of non-restrictively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Creating and perpetuating
division in the ways cited here ultimately stem from the failure to operate
interpersonally. As a result, bringing about unification appeals largely to
successful interpersonal operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Much of Christian unity will
probably come at the grassroots level—as it does with much renewal efforts. Grassroots
operation capitalizes more on interpersonal process because that is what
individual Christians have to capitalize on. A people’s movement has no
political clout, military force, authoritative intimidation, or economic duress
at its disposal. That ends up being an advantage because it limits people to
the thing that matters most.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The only way through some
problems is by attitude. Attitude refers to personal and interpersonal matters.
An interpersonal method (attitude) fits with, yea grows out of, an interpersonal
system like Christianity. Any program for Christian unification must draw
heavily on proper attitude. Proper attitude allows people time to change by
degrees into more correct understandings of doctrine. Proper attitude does not
replace correct doctrine, but it allows and encourages self-correction. Proper
attitude removes the tendency to create new, reinforcing roadblocks to unity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A person can stand for the
truth with a proper attitude of personal respect. When Jesus talked to the
woman of Samaria at the well of Sychar, he went ahead and said that salvation
was of the Jews, but he did it in a way that did not drive her away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Speaking the truth in love
(Ephesians<b> 4</b>:15) and striving for truth and grace (John <b>1</b>:17)
create a tension held together by interpersonal factors. In Christian unity we
are not always sure how to relate to people (love) without compromising truth. Content
(correctness) and incorrectness (which is what grace is for) can co-exist
because repentance plus forgiveness can exist in persons to make up for both sins
of ignorance and deliberate sins. <u>Attitude</u> and <u>intention</u> can be
right while productive results and action are wrong, and persons can
understand, and adjust to, that. Dealing with division attitudinally relates to
dealing with problems in the church pastorally. Ministers may not be able to
convince people with a different viewpoint that they need to change
(exegetically), but they may be able to convince them to hold their viewpoints
in a way that minimizes difficulties (personally). This procedure appeals to
interpersonal considerations. Respectful approach may disarm sufficiently that
later the issue can be solved exegetically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Working for unity through
interpersonal processes in effect appeals to Kenneth Burke’s dictum, “Identification
is compensatory to division” (<i>A Rhetoric of Motives</i>, 1969, p. 22). Identification
represents a mechanism that can provide the strategy for unifying divided
people. We overcome the division by providing a focal point for diverging tendencies.
In Christian unity, people unite by identifying with Jesus Christ as savior and
Lord. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Church unity reflects the
interpersonal character of the kingdom, because Christians are to involve themselves
in purposeful unity. “Purposeful” retains the eschatological idea, and the
unity keeps the existential element. Purposeful unity captures longitude and
latitude in one expression. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In summation,
interpersonalism (1) sets the atmosphere for discussing doctrinal
considerations, (2) establishes a principle for sorting through issues as to
how relatively important they are, and (3) qualifies the character of doctrinal
and formal aspects of Christianity.</span></p>
