<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>This presentation proposes
a way to help fulfill two responsibilities that we tend to put in tension with
one another: our responsibility for representing Christian truth and our
responsibility for facilitating Christian unity. The proposal stems from
believing that <i>interpersonalism prioritizes what naturally occupies central
place in Christianity. </i>We can draw on that observation to help us in the
quest for unity in Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In scripture, all things
equally true are not equally central. Even during the Old Covenant, the worth
of persons took precedence over the forms of religion. Interpersonal behaviors
like justice, mercy, and faith were weightier matters than strict tithing
requirements (Matthew <b>23</b>:23-24). Fulfilling the personal needs of
David’s men could take precedence over tabernacle regulations (Matthew <b>12</b>:1-8).
Mercy had priority over animal sacrifice (Matthew <b>9</b>:13; <b>12</b>:7;
Hosea <b>6</b>:6). The desire to worship could preempt the ceremonial
purifications required for Passover observance (2 Chronicles <b>30</b>:13-22).<i>
</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Jesus prioritized welfare
over Sabbath regulations (Mark<b> 2</b>:27). Circumcision stood second to
obeying God’s ordinances from the heart (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:19; Romans <b>2</b>:26-27).
Worship in spirit and truth meant more than the <i>place of worship</i> did
even though salvation was through the Jews (John <b>4</b>:22-24). God’s central
concern lay in rational activity like doing justly, loving kindness, walking
humbly, and obeying and loving God (Micah<b> 6</b>:8; Deuteronomy <b>10</b>:12-13).
Love fulfilled the Law (Matthew <b>22</b>:36-40; Romans <b>13</b>:8-10;
Galatians <b>5</b>:14; Matthew <b>7</b>:12).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>If interpersonal concerns
occupied a more central place under the Old Covenant, where formal and
ceremonial laws abounded, how much more do they predominate under the New
Covenant, where formal elements are minimal. God de-emphasized form and
ceremony by removing dietary laws (1 Corinthians <b>8</b>:8), national identity
(Galatians <b>3</b>:28), the festival cycle (Colossians <b>2</b>:16-17), and
the like. The practical point evident in this Old Testament list of priorities
is that secondary truths can vary while primary ones do not; otherwise, Old
Covenant elements could not be superseded by the New Covenants ones. That is
one reason for considering them primary or secondary. Without dismissing formal
matters altogether, we can legitimately pursue Christian unity by centralizing
the interpersonal category.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Several sets of
contrasting terms have been popular in the restoration movement: faith and
opinion, essential and non-essential, doctrine and method, where the Bible
speaks and is silent. These do not represent parallel sets; otherwise, wherever
the Bible speaks, it would define an essential matter of faith and fellowship,
and method would automatically fall back to non-essential status.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Opinion</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> normally means something that lacks
sufficient evidence to lead to a necessary conclusion; yet many points that are
opinion in that sense surely do not destroy fellowship. Christian unity does
not depend on knowing and understanding “facts” like Paul’s unrecorded visit to
Corinth between the writing of 1 and 2 Corinthians (2 Corinthians<b> 13</b>:1).
The magi did not come to the stable as Christmas cards often picture them
(Matthew <b>2</b>:11). Perhaps adding <i>fact</i> to <i>faith</i> and <i>opinion</i>
would help because people often do not agree what evidence is sufficient and
what constitutes a “necessary inference.” Facts would provide a category for
matters clear to most people but admitted by all not to be “essential” for
faith and practice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The crucial issue
remains, however, as to how we can distinguish among apparently true matters
(“facts” and “essentials”) to determine which are essentials. We do well then
to adopt yet another concept at this point: a central-to-less-central format
rather than a strict categorical, either-or distinction. That arrangement not
only retains the previous point that all true things are not equally important;
it also keeps all true things in the picture: secondary and tertiary matters do
not simply drop out. Essential <i>vs</i>. non-essential can imply that for all
practical purposes “non-essential” truths may be set aside permanently, which
constitutes one weakness in making interdenominationalism the highest goal for
Christian unity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Finally, for present considerations
we can adopt two principles among others for arranging specifics along a
continuum from central to less central. Both principles derive from
interpersonalism as the central reality in Christianity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Formal matters less
important</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—The first
principle states that (1) <i>formal matters are less central than interpersonal
ones.</i> Honest misunderstanding on formal matters does not in theory destroy
the basic concerns God had in instituting them, because the meaning of forms
takes precedence over the forms themselves. Such meanings can in principle be
embodied in alternate forms or meant in the hearts and deeds of persons without
any form at all. Forms are made for meanings, not meanings for forms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>God commands religious
forms for <i>our benefit, not his</i>. They help us focalize and make tangible
what in many ways are intangible elements of process. God commands religious
forms to <i>help us, not to effect results.</i> He <i>gives</i> any results
involved. Our formal obediences serve as positive conditions, not inherent
causes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The point here is not
that we can eliminate formal matters or replace a divine form with one of our
own. Circumcision of the heart, for example, is what made a true Israelite
(Romans <b>2</b>:29); yet Yahveh sought to kill Moses because he had not
circumcised his son (Exodus <b>4</b>:24-26; Genesis<b> 17</b>:14). Differences
among evangelicals on formal matters like baptism, worship, Communion, and
church structure occur because of their very attempt to obey God, not because
of neglect or disinterest; hence, the character of such misactions is not <i>dis</i>obedience,
but <i>mis</i>obedience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Honest
misunderstanding</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>
about <i>formal matters</i> should not be categorized with <i>intentional
disobedience</i> in <i>interpersonal matters.</i> In respect to honest
misunderstanding, we take it that God looks on the heart and knows people’s
intentions. Since we, being evil, honor sincerity in our own children, we
probably refrain from punishing them when through honest misunderstanding they
do not do what we <i>mean</i>. Their disappointment at not pleasing us is
“punishment” enough. God, being more gracious and merciful, evidently does as
much or more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In the interests of truth,
we have sometimes said that sincerity does not save. Sincerity does not make us
<i>right</i>, but hopefully it does make us <i>forgivable.</i> Misaction based
on honest misunderstanding is still misaction, but something can be <i>erroneous</i>
without being <i>reckoned</i> against us. Errors are not reckoned till
knowledge comes (Romans<b> 7</b>:9-10; cp. <b>3</b>:25; <b>4</b>:15; 5:13; Acts
<b>17</b>:30-31), at which time the repentance-forgiveness process comes into
play (Acts <b>9</b>:9; 1 Timothy <b>1</b>:13). Meantime, sincerity protects
from wrath. But sincerity, to be considered sincerity, must be seeking
self-correction by studying the Word, listening to other sincere people, and by
acting on our new understandings—items that apply to all of us. In Christian
unity, highlighting (1) <i>honest </i>misunderstanding of (2) <i>formal</i>
commandments seems doubly appropriate when we view such commandments as less
central than interpersonal ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Keeping interpersonalism central not
only <i>decentralizes</i> formal matters, it <i>interpersonalizes</i> them.
Being put second to interpersonal things means that formal matters are
contextualized by that interpersonal framework. The interpersonal context
changes them from legal acts that effect results and transforms them into
personal acts that meet conditions for gifts from God. However, if formal
commands are made equal and parallel to interpersonal behavior, because of
their concreteness they tend to “take over” psychologically and to transform
Christianity from an interpersonal system into a legal one. Legalism not only
ruins Christianity and frustrates its reconciling purpose among persons; it
creates a mindset that fosters division and works against Christian unity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Behavioral correlates
significant</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—The
second principle states that (2) <i>doctrines without behavioral correlates are
less central than those correlated with interpersonal activity.</i> Morality
deals with behavior between persons vertically and horizontally. Doctrines that
do not affect relationships are regarded as secondary in a program for
reconciling persons estranged by sinful behavior. Personal behavior toward God
and other people is not particularly affected by a person’s view on the precise
nature of the Father-Son-Spirit relationship, the relationship of the divine
and human in Christ, the relationship of body-soul-spirit in humans, the view
of predestination as of the “plan” or of the “man”; the view of the millennium
and other eschatological matters like the rapture, the tribulation, the future
role of Israel, the nature of the intermediate states and of hell, the view of
mankind as inherently <i>vs.</i> conditionally immortal, the view of scripture
as infallible <i>vs.</i> inerrant, several Pentecostal-charismatic issues, the
specific view of origins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Many of these doctrines
are complicated, some seem not to receive precise treatment in scripture, and
most do not need to impact relational behavior even indirectly. We may prefer
not to give <i>leadership</i> positions to people with extreme views on some of
these subjects, but we do not put them out of the <i>fellowship</i> or start a
new denomination because of them. With notable exceptions, even the evangelical
wing of the restoration movement has exercised more tolerance on several of
these “theological” issues than many other groups have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We do not mean to suggest
here that only commandments </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'>about</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>
relational behavior have relevance to unity; we mean to include doctrines that </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>impact</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> relational behavior. An illustration
may help convey our point. When early Christianity encountered the Gentile
world, it conflicted with common philosophical assumptions in pagan thought.
Especially troublesome was the notion that spirit is good and matter is evil.
Gentiles that came in contact with the Christian community tried to introduce
that belief into the churches—with disastrous results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>If matter is evil, the
incarnation would not have occurred because good spirit would not have
deliberately mixed itself with evil flesh. Likewise, Christ’s resurrection
would not have occurred, and our resurrection would not be desirable since our
goal would be to </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>escape</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> our situation of being “mixed with”
material flesh. “Salvation” did not mean restoring personal relationship but
escaping material existence. Salvation did not come from moral change but from
secret knowledge. One approach to the body was to satiate it because matter and
spirit could not affect or change each other; so the acts of the material body
could not taint the spirit, and immorality could run rampant. Another approach
was to depreciate the flesh, which led to asceticism and to denying the natural
satisfaction of bodily drives as much as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The gospels and the
epistles are replete with teachings obviously designed to counter this cluster
of heresies. In fact, most denunciations of false teachers in the New Testament
appear to address either the Judaizing teachers, who wanted to make Gentile
converts into national Jews, or this spirit-matter dualism and its implications.
The doctrine of spirit-matter dualism did have very serious behavioral
correlates even though it did not address moral matters directly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Not all doctrinal matters
have interpersonal implications, however, nor do they strike at other obvious
doctrinal points like the incarnation and the resurrection of Christ. The
differences we face among evangelicals are of a different kind and order of magnitude,
and they stem from an different motivation. The severe strictures that the
apostles leveled at their opponents do not belong to the kind of situation
evangelicals deal with in seeking Christian unity today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Orrin Root, editor of </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The Christian Standard</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>, spoke at one of my college
baccalaureate services in the late 1960s. The gist of his message was this: </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>“know who your friends are, know who
your enemies are, and know how to tell the difference.”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> That is good advice for Christian
unity too. Evangelicals devoted to Christ and committed to scripture do not
qualify as </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>“enemies
of the cross of Christ”</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'> except perhaps because of attitude, which is a fault not restricted to
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Their errors and ours
come from </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>misinterpreting</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> apostolic writings, not from </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>denying </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>them, </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>neglecting</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> them, or </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>competing</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> with their authority. That
circumstance justifies hope for unity in the restoration movement and in the
larger believing community, because we have a high proportion of common ground
on central truth, and because so many of the differences exist in less central
areas like formal commandments and doctrines without behavioral correlates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Among other things,
persons are characterized by a difference between intent and truth, that is, by
the subjective-objective variable. Therefore, interpersonal relationships take
that variable into account to avoid operating contrary to the nature of the
situation. Since Christianity centers on interpersonal concerns, Christians
must apply that variable deliberately in gaining and retaining their oneness in
Christ. In seeking unity, Christians must work from the center out.</span></p>
