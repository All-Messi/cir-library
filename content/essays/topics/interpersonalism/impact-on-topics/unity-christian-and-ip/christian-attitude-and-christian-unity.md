<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>This article encourages using
interpersonal principles in the quest for Christian unity.<sup>1</sup> We are
reflecting on the role of attitude in creating an atmosphere for conflict
resolution in the body of Christ today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The first observation is
simply that (a) <i>proper attitude increases other people’s willingness to
listen to our viewpoint. </i>The Golden Rule works because we tend to respond <i>in
kind</i>. The pattern operates negatively and positively: disrespect usually
evokes disrespect, and respect evokes respect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We also tend to respond <i>in
greater kind.</i> The competitive attitude behind hateful words and acts
typically produces even greater hostility in the responding person, and the
interaction enters a downward spiral of deterioration. Not only does the
interaction deteriorate or grow from <i>neutral</i>; proper attitude can <i>reverse
</i>a downward spiral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The interpersonal dynamic
in the Golden Rule provides the key for unlocking resources to reverse division
and increase unity. The spiritual fruit Christ intends to produce in us serves
to give us a real oneness in him at the same time. Experience teaches us that
people <i>do not</i> listen to smart people with bad attitudes. The Golden Rule
implies that we <i>will not</i> change in response to knowledgeable people that
do not care about us. The very purpose of Christ warns that we <i>should not</i>
follow leaders whose personalities lack the weightier matters of the faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We should not expect other
evangelicals to listen to our viewpoints about certain formal matters
associated with the gospel if we are not characterized by the weightier matters
of the gospel itself. A high percentage of differences among believers concerned
about restoration and evangelicalism as a whole as well as with within the
segments of the restoration movement itself has in fact been over formal,
ceremonial, “civil” matters. To get a feel for the prominence of formal
differences among Christians generally and among members of the restoration communities,
we have taken the space to present a representative list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Differences</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—In regard to <i>baptism</i>,
believers disagree on whether its action must be immersion, whether its
administrator much be ordained, whether its candidate must be an adult, whether
the action is single or triune, whether to use the trinitarian or “Jesus-only”
formula, where it lies in the cluster of responses during initial salvation. Is
baptism by members of other fellowships valid?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In regard to the <i>Lord’s
Supper</i>,<i> </i>do the emblems need to be unfermented? Must we use one loaf
and one cup? Does an ordained administrator need to preside at the table? Is
the Supper weekly or less frequent? May we observe it only on Sunday? May
unimmersed believers participate? Do we conceive of Communion as worship so as
to make children’s participation appropriate? Is Communion a function of the
membership of the local fellowship alone? Is feetwashing part of fourfold
Communion?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In regard to <i>worship</i>,
do believers meet on Saturday or Sunday? May mechanical instruments accompany
gathered worship? May we use them in worship at home? Are choirs and special
music permissible? May we use “songs of human composure”? What kinds of music
are acceptable? Must women wear a head covering during gathered worship? Is
there a biblical order of worship? Are church-owned buildings for worship
proper?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In regard to the <i>church</i>,
does the New Testament intend to specify a structure for it? Does it have a
divine name? Is local autonomy the norm? Must there be a plurality of elders in
the local church? Is their term of office for life? Do elders and deacons have
to be married with a plurality of grown children who believe? May congregations
have paid ministers? Is there an office of deaconess? Is Sunday school scriptural?
What is the function of ordination? May parachurch agencies exist? Can
congregations come together to form such agencies, or must they be incorporated
under a board of individuals as trustees, or must they be incorporated under
the eldership of a local church? Can one church assist another in a common
task?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Like other movements, the
restoration movement has not avoided the disorienting stress on formal matters.
In fact, the entire movement historically defined has probably become more
absorbed in them than many other evangelical groups have, particularly as time
has gone on. Succeeding generations have tended to suppose in these matters
that being more exact is being more correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>This rather formidable
list includes items of varying importance, but none of them are the essence of
Christian concern. Giving that verdict does not imply that we can dismiss any
of them if the New Testament scriptures address them. Whatever God’s Word
teaches we cannot intentionally set aside, neglect, or make negotiable. But to
gain a hearing on such lesser matters, we have to demonstrate maturity in
practicing the weightier ones. The biblical principle of education requires
that only the personally mature can teach the way of the Lord more perfectly.
Acknowledging that principle by act and attitude increases the likelihood of
being heard on formal as well as doctrinal and interpersonal matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Changes</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>—On the other side of the
relationship, (b) <i>proper attitude puts us in a frame of mind to accept
correction.</i> A unity movement that has contributed twenty to thirty new
divisions evidently needs something more in understanding, personnel, or
practice. Many of us can come to see ourselves more objectively and realize how
out of place it would be for divisive spirits to call for unity among
Christians more mature than themselves. Perhaps some of us need to be corrected
about the relative importance we attach to our distinctives by considering how
things equally true can be unequally important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We may need to learn more
accurately what other Christians believe, and especially why they believe that
way. Most doctrinal issues are more complex than people typically imagine. The
case even for something like infant baptism can be put more cogently that adult
baptizers normally represent. Perseverance of the saints is meant as a more
dynamic concept than it is usually described by those who believe apostasy can
happen.<sup>2</sup> Superficial objections to such viewpoints may work because
we frequently deal with laymen or with misters who do not do the best job of
defending their own positions; so we can develop a false sense of competence at
refuting them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Furthermore, we may need
to correct our thinking about why people do not readily change to our
perspective on issues. The restoration movement originated under significant
influence from Enlightenment philosophy. One of its idealist premises still
commonly misapplied to that movement—and elsewhere—states that, presented with
the same evidence, reasonable people of goodwill will come to the same
conclusion. Other people then appear to be unreasonable or unwilling when they
continue to disagree after hearing the evidence; apparently they are refusing
to submit to the authority of scripture, do not believe the Bible, do not care
what it says, or are too weak-willed to break with their present religious
associations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Other explanations are
probably more accurate in most cases. They may not feel competent to reason
through seemingly complex issues, so they “trust” their way through them by
depending on people they most respect. Their not being able to answer an
argument does not mean for them that it cannot be answered, and wise people do
not leave what they have until they are confident they have a better option to
go to even if their present view has difficulties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>More importantly, we may
not see the fallacy of our own reasoning or conceivably the questionableness of
our own goodwill. Our scholarship does not always have the quality we think it
does, and the scholars we have trusted may be less competent than we realize.
Like most people, our impulse is to feel that error lies elsewhere and that
others should do the changing, but being <i>certain</i> and being <i>right </i>are
not the same thing. Other people do not want to change any more than we do, and
they feel as certain about their beliefs as we feel. Obviously, mutually
exclusive views cannot both be correct, but we have no more reason up front to
think we are right than they have. A proper attitude on everyone’s part
provides the only way to break through these doctrinal impasses in current
Christendom, because attitude allows “us” and “them” to be corrected through
mutual communication and edification.</span></p>
