<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Efforts at Christian
unity have variously stressed one or more bases: organizational union, common
experience, or essential doctrine. Roman Catholicism exemplifies the concern
for unity through the church as an institution, which is particularly fitting
because Catholic theology conceives of grace as flowing through the church by
way of duly ordained clergy: “where the bishop is, there is the church.”
Because of the emphasis on tongue speaking, pentecostalism can illustrate the
common-experience approach. Erasmus among others advocated a minimum set of
essential doctrines as foundational for Christian unity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>To some degree all these
categories in <u>theory</u> have legitimate places in ideal oneness through
Christ. In <u>practice</u>, however, whatever value they have depends on the
interpersonal factors that implement them. God purposes in Christ to create <i>“a
new united mankind” </i>(Ephesians <b>2</b>:15). Personal characteristics and
interpersonal processes figure prominently in accomplishing an interpersonal
purpose. Attitude, motives, and spiritual fruit constitute the means of
achieving human oneness through Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>(a)<u> Proper attitude
helps overcome division because division is significantly an interpersonal
problem</u>. Division among evangelicals represents a complex issue, not a
simple one. The denominated situation has five marks: (1) peculiar doctrines,
(2) exclusivistic attitude, (3) restricted fellowship, (4) distinguishing
names, and (5) separate organizations. Individually or in combination, these
marks create a circumstance less than the ideal Christ wants for his church.
Overcoming division needs to address each part of this complex problem because
division represents more than, say, a doctrinal problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>In this cluster, exclusivistic
attitude occupies a prominent position. Immaturity in persons (2) takes
distinctive doctrines (1) and produces the other three marks (3-4-5): <u>doctrine
leads to</u> <u>division by way of attitude</u>. On some occasions, division
may need to occur <i>“to make clear who are approved” </i>(1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:19).
These instances relate to church discipline for behavioral reasons rather than
to peculiar doctrines that result from honest misinterpretation. Doctrinal
difference is the most nearly legitimate item among the five. Since no earthly
magisterium exists to safeguard against misunderstanding, the right and
responsibility to read scripture for oneself produces different viewpoints from
time to time. Proper attitude has to replace any role an official magisterium
would have. Mutual respect can prevail to keep peculiar doctrines from
escalating into crystallized division.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Division leads to peculiar doctrine
by way of attitude</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.
Among the five marks of denominationalism, another dynamic operates: over time
crystallized division tends to generate new doctrine. There comes into play an
unconscious tendency to create additional reasons for maintaining separateness
to ensure identity. Among other things, those differences come in the form of
peculiar doctrines. Fellowships that are doctrinally closest can have the most
strained relationships because their leaders work harder to make the finer
distinctions clear and convincing to their constituencies. Mutual caring can
help keep new doctrinal peculiarities from developing as well as any further
divisions they might produce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The importance of interpersonal
factors appears in the observation that <u>division can exist without doctrinal
differences</u>. If God’s people can fragment without having the most nearly
legitimate basis for it, we can understand how powerful a tool attitude can be
for good or ill in this matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Proper attitude corrects as well as
prevents divisions</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.
The process that keeps new divisions from arising also overcomes divisions that
already exist. Christians today have inherited a situation we did not create.
We bear responsibility for making sure no new ones develop. But more than that,
we bear responsibility for correcting what we can, because the same
interpersonal processes that prevent also correct. As immaturity (2) leads from
doctrine (1) to division (3-4-5) so also maturity leads from division to
agreement and unity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>(b) <u>A proper attitude
prompts us to put other people and their beliefs in the best light</u>. Love
for people does not foster love for caricature. <u>When we care about people,
we do not misrepresent them</u> in order to gain undue advantage. Any of us who
have experienced being misrepresented know how frustrating it feels and how
distant it makes our critics appear to us. At some time or other someone may
have come to our church building and called our piano a “golden calf,” or we
have been accused of preaching baptismal regeneration. From such experiences we
should learn how destructive it is to Christian unity to make needless
statements like <i>“They teach people to disobey Christ.”</i> It is a different
thing to say, <i>“You don’t have to be baptized to be saved,” </i>than to say, <i>“You
don’t have to be baptized.”</i> Those believers obey the Lord in baptizing
their converts; they see the “moment of salvation” related to baptism in a
different way. The differences are real, but we do not have to make them more
different than they are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>When we care about people, we try not
to misread them</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.
That is easier said than done, of course, because it is harder to understand
what we do not believe. I was raised among the restoration churches and
finished eight years of full-time college study in that context. During my
three years of graduate work at Wheaton College. I came to a changed
understanding of what represented at least a large segment of evangelical
Christianity. The faculty, staff, and student body came to Wheaton from various
denominations, but they did not take the attitude toward each other or me that
I had assumed denominations took. In their churches they were not working <u>dividedly</u>
but <u>separately</u>. They discouraged the competition mentality and
interdenominational “proselyting” because such efforts diverted attention from
the common task of evangelism and Christian growth. They worked separately in
their denominations because, given the doctrinal differences involved, working
together would have created recurring tensions. Separateness is not ideal, but
it is better than working against each other. The distinction lies in personal
attitude that affects interpersonal relationship. What will not fully be solved
in fact can partially be solved in attitude—pastorally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Distinguishing between divided and
separate puts much of denominationalism in a different light. Their working
together at the local level would be almost as unlikely as combining
non-instrumentalists and independents in the same congregation. Denominationalism
today does not necessarily retain the character it evidently had 175 years ago.
We can adjust our perception where appropriate and be glad for any progress in
attitude that takes place. Above everything, we can make sure that the present
situation does not get reversed from the concern that prompted the restoration
movement in the first place. Restoration churches should not regard other
religious groups more negatively than those groups view each other—or how they
view restoration churches. When we stand too distant from them and their
viewpoints, we get distorted perceptions. Interpersonalism encourages us to
maintain the contact necessary for reading appropriately what other Christians
believe and what they are like, so we do not hinder unity while advocating it.</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We dare not allow Christian unity to
become a historical vestige of our pursuit of sound doctrine or <i>vice versa</i>.
Unity and doctrine tend to create a tension that we can manage only by the
interpersonal skills that scripture includes in spiritual fruit.</span></p>
