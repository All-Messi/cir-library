<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>  I. The gift of the Spirit is first of
all an interpersonal relationship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The Holy Spirit is a person,
not a force, a power, a feeling, an atmosphere, idea, principle, or attitude. He
is not God’s energy. Since the Spirit is a person and people are persons, <i>“having
the Spirit”</i> means relating to deity in the person of the Spirit. Consequently,
his guidance and empowerment come first through interpersonal means—influence before
miracle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            He operates (a) through
scripture, (b) through the influences of people influenced by scripture,  and (c)
through the sheer  relationship  itself.               </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In addition to these purely
interpersonal operations, there may come supernatural operation (d) through special
divine providence and (e) through manifest miracle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <u>Indwelling</u> is
understood figuratively rather than literally. God the Spirit is not a force
that literally permeates a person’s body or locates itself inside each Christian.
Sinners, then, are not holes in the universal, omnipresent Spirit. Indwelling
refers to close personal association that influences a person from the inside
out. It is comparable to statements like, “You can just see his mother in him”
or “What’s gotten into him?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In Ephesians <b>3</b>:17-18
Paul says that the Spirit dwells in our hearts by faith. The nature of the
indwelling corresponds with what causes it—faith. The <u>empowerment</u> comes
from an indwelling brought about by faith. The same goes for <u>guidance</u>, <u>unification</u>,
and <u>intercession</u>, the other effects of the Spirit’s work</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The break between objective
and subjective allows error to enter the picture, which explains why people can
think they have received <u>revelation</u> when the subsequent verdict of time
disqualifies it as divine revelation. This format likewise shows how <u>empowerment</u>
can occur even when there is no objective basis for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since Christianity deals
primarily with interpersonalism, it cures primarily through interpersonal means.
So psychological strength and the power to cope with suffering come first
through interpersonal means. The indwelling of the Spirit is the positive
relationship between the personal Spirit and a human person. The indwelling is
non-locational; indwelling is an image for all-pervasive influence and
character. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>II. The gifts of the Spirit become such
by way of the interpersonal relationship itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Aside from supernatural
endowments, innate abilities and developed skills become gifts of the Spirit when
a person comes into fellowship with God. Abilities and skills become gifts of
the Spirit via their new context as well as the new motivation and value system
that reshape their use and connect them to different goals—the goals of the
Spirit of Christ. Even supernatural endowments retain the interpersonal element
by coming from a person rather than something impersonal. Inborn talents and
developed skills become gifts of the Spirit when a person comes under the
influence of the Spirit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. The gifts of the Spirit are for
interpersonal use. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Spiritual gifts are
interpersonal in that (1) they are not for benefiting animals, plants, or
things (healing, <i>e.g</i>., was never used for healing animals) and (2) they
are not for the individual, but for others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            All gifts of the Spirit appear
in interpersonal settings, whether talents, abilities, or supernatural
endowments. In no case did Christ, the apostles, or anyone else ever use a
supernatural gift for personal gain. They are used on persons for persons, and
they are used on <u>other</u> persons. Jesus did not come down from the cross
to save himself; he saved others. He did not turn the stones to bread to feed
himself. He did not cast himself down from the pinnacle of the temple to get
attention of worshipers below.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Our point here applies also
to language speaking. Language speaking is not intended to uplift the person
particularly (although, of course, that would be a byproduct). In the New
Testament, languages were always used to communicate <u>to</u> others as in
proclamation and exhortation or communicate <u>for</u> others as in public
prayer. They were actual human languages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Consequently,
interpersonalism correlates with the nature and use of spiritual gifts. All
spiritual gifts are for use between persons. They are not—as in the notion of
private prayer language or being slain in the spirit—for the purpose of
self-application. They are not experiences for their own sakes nor ends in
themselves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Jesus interpersonalized his miracles
by doing them to benefit people rather than for sheer supernatural display. In
this respect, divine miracle differs from demonic manifestation, which is
negative or at best neutral on interpersonal considerations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Jesus further
interpersonalized his miracles by doing them on the condition of faith. He did
not need the recipient’s or sponsor’s faith to succeed, as the case of Malchus
shows. Jesus did not do miracles to satisfy curiosity—as for Herod (Luke <b>3</b>:8).
His efforts were calculated both to authenticate him, to benefit persons, and
to draw people to God. Consequently, most of his signs were healing miracles. Faith
was involved in these as a required condition and a calculated result. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> IV. The <u>fruit</u> of the Spirit is
interpersonally produced by influence rather than by supernatural deposit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonal influence is
the manner in which the ordinary effects of the Spirit are produced in a person’s
life. The <u>fruit</u> of the Spirit is all the interpersonal kinds of fruits
and are produced interpersonally rather than supernaturally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> V. The interpersonal takes precedence
over the miraculous in Holy Spirit matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The interpersonal aspects of
the Spirit (gift of the Spirit, indwelling, fruit bearing) are <u>uniform for
all Christians at all times and places</u>, whereas the supernatural is
associated with specific persons and at special times, places, and
circumstances. The supernatural is not always involved, but the “ordinary” is
always present and normative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            In summation, the origin,
content, nature, purpose, and use of spiritual gifts are interpersonal.</span></p>
