<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Christian growth
(sanctification) relates to perseverance in Christ because continued growth
safeguards against apostasy. The writer of Hebrews suggests interpersonal
activity as a way to persevere. He speaks of fellowship with the faithful,
imitation of the faithful, and service to all mankind (chs. <b>10-13</b>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Personal relationships also
connect with perseverance in that how we relate is equally relevant all along
the way—at life’s end as much as at any previous time. Not only is how we
relate <u>relevant</u>, it is <u>determinative</u> at each point along the way.
<u>Present</u> relationships are good or bad in terms of <u>present</u> good or
bad motives, attitudes, and behaviors. It is not good now because it was good
before—as if past acts could override present behavior. Like any social
relationship, fellowship with God in the end is not an average figured across
the whole life span; it consists of how things are in the end. It is not
determined by making judgment at some point in the past; it is determined by
judgment at the end (the final “now”). For the same reasons, previous
“salvation” relationship does not preclude present alienation any more than bad
past behavior destroys present reconciliation (Ezekiel <b>18</b>:21-24). There
is no thought of forming a social bond that somehow remains permanent despite subsequently
departing from those behaviors that were required for establishing it. The
state at the end is not the result of permanent miraculous change of substantive
nature (condition); neither is it a permanent legal status irreversible by
decree. It is an interpersonal relationship made permanent by perseverant
repentance and faithful forgiveness.</span></p>
