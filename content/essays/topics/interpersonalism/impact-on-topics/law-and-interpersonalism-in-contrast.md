<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Law and personal
relationship do not have a (1) <i>part-to-whole</i> relationship. Legal process
does not represent a secondary operation inside of interpersonal operation. Grace-faith
does not function inside of law, and law does not provide mechanisms inside of
interpersonalism. In Pauline terms, works are <u>not part of</u> the
grace-faith-promise-spirit system. Likewise, legality and interpersonalism are
not (2) <i>parts of a common larger operation</i>.<span style='position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>1</span> Legal works do <u>not supplement or combine with</u>
interpersonal actions in bringing about the interpersonal consequences needed
by estranged persons. Legal operations <u>are foreign to</u> interpersonal
process. The two systems are parallel, alternative, and mutually exclusive.<span
style='position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>2</span> If something is of law, it is no
longer of faith (Galatians <b>2</b>:12); if it is legal, it is not
interpersonal. If it is of grace, it is no more of works (Romans <b>11</b>:6). If
inheritance is of law, faith is void and promise is of no effect (Romans <b>4</b>:14).
Grace, faith, and promise are aspects of interpersonal operation in contrast to
works and debt, which belong to legal process (Romans <b>4</b>:13-16; cp.
Galatians <b>3</b>:18). God has not established procedures for persons to go
through to get salvation; he has given them a Person to identify with and
commit to in order to receive it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Legal and interpersonal
differ significantly in their nature and operation. (a) Law operates in <u>straight-line
causal series</u>, whereas inter-personalism involves <u>reciprocation</u> in
addition sequence. Legal transaction calls for correct order because the
validity of each step depends on the proper accomplishment of the preceding
one. Interpersonal operations are not as highly patterned. Trust, repentance,
confession, baptism, and so on, are inter-reinforcing <u>aspects</u> of an
interpersonal process rather than discrete <u>steps</u> in a legal sequence. They
form a gestalt whose parts interact. Forgiveness, gift of the Spirit, and
church membership form a logical sequence but not a chronological one. They
form parts of one whole event rather than a sequence spread out over time. The
“plan of salvation” is not patternistic, formulaic, transactional; that would
be too much like law or logic—or worse yet, magic. Baptism both expresses the
others and reinforces them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(b) Law is more <u>rigid</u>
and static while persons are more fluid, <u>flexible</u>, and progressive. Christianity
does not present a “cut and dried” formula for reconciliation, because
fellowship cannot be cut and dried, and establishing it does not have to take
one particular format. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(c) Law transactions
are more <u>quantitative</u>, categorical, and time-referenced while personal
processes are more <u>qualitative</u>, gradual, and less tied to exact times. In
the interpersonal setting, however, sins are not cleansed on an item-for-item
or time-period by time-period basis. When it comes to social processes
especially, being more definite does not always mean being more correct. Over
time, dynamic religious movements tend to degenerate, because adherents tend to
crystallize their thinking to make things more exact, especially as they
attempt to articulate their viewpoints to popular audiences. Crystallization
often takes place by legalizing (as well as rationalizing or ontologizing) what
is by nature interpersonal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(d) In law, <u>authority</u>
connects antecedent and consequence; but in interpersonalism, <u>choice</u>
connects them. Law produces automatic, uniform results because the operation
does not pass through a person’s will. Results come out of the law itself. A
given case does not go above the law to the person(s) who originated the law. Persons
<i>originate</i> a legal system, but once it is in place it operates on its
own—at least it does so unless the originators take positive action to override
its functioning. Persons <i>carry out</i> the law, but they are officers of the
law. It is the law, not they, that brings about the results. Furthermore,
psychologically those who come before the law tend not to focus on the person,
but on the process. They may not, for example, consciously associate remission
of sins with God’s choice, but with the procedures involved. But in
relationship matters, the other party <u>chooses</u> to <u>give</u> mercy (Romans
<b>9</b>:14-16). Christian ordinances, then, are not sacraments in the
technical sense, because they do not involve automatic flow of grace. Christian
ordinances do not have automatic results but volitional consequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(e)  Law can have <u>unnatural
validity</u> because valid consequences do not have to come from factors
natural to the real circumstance; they can come from authority resident in the
law. Of particular importance in legal functions is the fact, on the one hand,
that intentionality—or the lack of it, for that matter—need not count for
anything. On the other hand, externalism can be valid under law. In religious
law, sacramental operation can have validity aside from the subjective attitude
of the recipient or administrator and even aside from the candidate’s conscious
awareness. Moreover, each step in the procedure ends up, in a sense, having <u>equal
importance</u>, because any one step can void the transaction since the steps
form a strict series. Finally, law involves <u>exclusive option</u> because
only those provisions identified in the law have validity. Other appropriate
options can have no value by the sheer fact that they are not mentioned. Possibilities
are restricted to what the constitution specifies, and silence alone eliminates
other alternatives. The basis for validity rests in legal authority rather than
in natural factors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A final difficulty
arises from confusing legal systems with interpersonal ones. Legal processes
can involve (f) <u>permanent results without continued qualification</u>. Once people
graduate from college, they are permanently college graduates with “all the
rights and privileges that pertain thereunto”—even if they remember little of
what they learned there. When that “feel” for the process gets transferred to
baptism, for example, baptized people consider their salvation as finished
business. Their completion does not, so to speak, become a “commencement.” They
presume on their baptism as “completed obedience,” much as some people presume
on their wedding as the cause of a settled matter—and with the same disastrous
results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Christian baptism,
however, identifies people with Jesus Christ for the very purpose of indicating
their concern about the sin problem in personal relationships. Only as long as people
desire appropriate action in relationship to God and other people does their
past formal act of baptism have any present meaning (cp. Romans <b>2</b>:25).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

top:-3.0pt'>1</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Law as the mechanism for
interpersonalism would be Pharisaism; law as continuing what was begun by
interpersonalism would be Galatianism. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;position:relative;
top:-3.0pt'>2</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We do not suggest that legal
authority can never be involved with interpersonal activity. Authority <u>enhances</u>
practical operation for the sake of efficiency and orderliness, and it may be invoked
to <u>protect</u> when necessary if persons continue to refuse interpersonal
influence. We mean only that legal operation does <u>not itself produce</u> the
consequences. The Mosaic law, added to the earlier Abrahamic promise, did not
annul promise, but neither did it become the means of accomplishing what was by
promise (Galatians <b>3</b>:15-29). Even <u>under</u> law, salvation was not <u>by</u>
law. Legal operation often accompanies interpersonal process in the practical
situation to gain efficiency, not effectiveness.</span></p>
