<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Divine guidance takes
place with people; hence, it includes choices, thinking, feelings, and other
personal factors with both God and people. God does not make all our choices
for us; he treats us like friends more than like slaves. Pushing the idea that
God has a special plan for each person may be nothing more than (1) the old
self-centeredness in religious garb; self-centeredness is not interpersonal. (2)
It may be a kind of laziness, because people do not want to put out significant
effort in deciding or taking responsibility for their decisions. Submitting to
God does not mean being submissive. “Super-spirituality” is not interpersonal
spirituality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonalism
applied to guidance means that we have a sense of assistance while taking
responsibility. Scripture provides the primary content for guidance. The
general will of God for all people establishes the beginning of his specific
will for me; so we <u>study</u> to know it. God shapes our destiny indirectly
through circumstance, other people, and sheet presence; so we <u>pray</u> to
activate special intervention. We are aided by the mature judgment of other
Christians; so we <u>fellowship</u> with the faithful to gain encouragement and
advice. Our direct relationship with God itself has a directing and motivating
effect on our life choices; so we <u>practice the spiritual exercises</u> to
keep God-consciousness at a functional level. Thomas Chisholm, in “Great Is Thy
Faithfulness,” aptly wrote, <i>“Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>God’s will to guide includes
prescription and permission. Inasmuch as both guide, they are interpersonal
because guidance is an interpersonal thing. “Prescriptive” refers to what
begins with God; “permissive” refers to what begins elsewhere. In narrowing
reference, nature, providence, scripture, and miracle provide prescriptive
guidance. Providence is interpersonal because God intervenes to assist persons.
Permissive begins with people and proceeds with the attitude <i>“if the Lord
will”</i> (James<b> 4</b>:13-15; Acts <b>18</b>:21;    1 Corinthians <b>4</b>:19;
<b>16</b>:7). Either way it is God’s will, hence, his guidance. God “passes on”
any choice a person makes, and his allowing means choosing to allow.</span></p>
