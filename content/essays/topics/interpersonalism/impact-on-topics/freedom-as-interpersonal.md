<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Freedom means moving in
accordance with reality. Freedom is not detachment from everything; that would
be lostness. It means moving in conformity with what is there. The
interpersonal connection lies in acknowledging the presence of God and other
persons and in living with them instead of striving after an unreal
individualism. Fulfillment comes from association; people must live in
conformity with the fact that they are persons designed for relationship with
persons. A certain amount of individual limitation is necessary to be free
because other reality exists. Proper relationship to God sets the stage for
proper relationship to everything else. Divine fellowship sets the stage for
objective freedom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Freedom applies to our
relationship to the will of God (eschatological) and the existence of God
(existential). We internalize God’s “laws” in our hearts (Jeremiah <b>31</b>:31-34)
under the New Covenant. His values originate outside us, but we do not feel
hemmed in and held down by them, because we internalize them. We feel impelled
from within by what we have owned rather than compelled from outside by the
will of Another. When we love the One who wills for us, his commandments are
not grievous (1 John <b>5</b>:3). When we internalize the word (Jeremiah <b>31</b>),
we personalize it (1 John<b> 5</b>:3; 2 Corinthians <b>3</b>:2-6a).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Being free from law
means being free from the <u>perfection</u> requirement in a works system (Galatians
<b>3</b>:1). Christ nailed the Law to the cross (Colossians <b>2</b>:13-14), so
to speak, not to eliminate expectancies, but to shift from a legal to an
interpersonal grounding for them. Freedom from perfection frees us for better
performance because the pressure to avoid every failure allows us to
concentrate on succeeding. An athlete is more likely to hit the foul shot if
the game does not depend on it; otherwise, even a good athlete more easily
“chokes.” It is a question now of acceptance by another person, not constant
success in measuring up to some standard. As long as the heart endeavors to do,
aspires to be, and wants to please, the difference between performance and
perfection is “made up for” by the repentance-forgiveness process, by
“understanding” on the other person’s part. Releasing us from the necessity of
perfection is liberating. We are free from the Law of sin and death (Romans <b>8</b>:2).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Freedom from perfection
likewise means freedom from past sin and from the sense of guilt and rejection
that goes with it (<u>death</u>). In an interpersonal system, the past is
irrelevant to the present unless someone holds it against us or we do not
change from it. But when by repentance we separate from our past sins, we
affirm that we are no longer what such actions represent. By forgiveness God
also removes our past from affecting the way he views us in present
relationship. Even though we still remember that we have sinned against
someone, our conscience stops bothering us when that person no longer holds our
failure against us. We can now forget about it. Release from guilt brings
relief from conscience, and <u>life</u> begins again in fellowship.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Being free from law
also means being free from <u>abstract rules</u> and regulations and committing
instead to a Person’s expectancy. “Works” are done to a standard; “faith” is
done to a Person. Works are done to a result; faith is done toward another. The
former feels dissociated from the other person; the latter stresses the
personal association with the other’s expectations. With that difference come
freedom from an impersonal milieu and reconciliation into a personal
association with its more natural kind, and greater degree, of motivation.
Christ delivers us from the frustration of failure and liberates us to a new
life that is life indeed (Romans <b>7</b>:7-25).</span></p>
