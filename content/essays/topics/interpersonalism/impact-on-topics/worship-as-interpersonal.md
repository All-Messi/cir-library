text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship is an
interpersonal act in the vertical direction. It requires awareness,
imagination, and concentration in contrast to habit or a stimulus-response
elicited by form, place, or atmosphere. There is no required <u>posture</u> of
the body, just a posture of the heart and mind. There is no necessary <u>location</u>
such as one mountain or city (John <b>4</b>:21). Instead, God wants people to
worship him in spirit and truth because he is spirit and truth. Spirit lies
inside interpersonalism. It does not require a temple, church building, or
prayer room. It does not call for quietness or loudness, stillness or movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship calls for
self-expression</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, which means that the
worshipers’ character forms a context for the activity they perform: <i>“The
prayer of righteous people avails much”</i> (James <b>5</b>:16). <i>“People
need to test themselves and then observe the Lord’s Supper”</i> (1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:28).
Since worship is interpersonal, the character of the worshiper is relevant to its
validity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship seeks closer
conscious unity with God</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>—drawing near
to God (Hebrews <b>10</b>:1-4). The goal is not to lose identity in the worship
experience, but to express our identity to God through that experience. Our
identity is the means of associating with God. Worship is not the mystical
experience of the flight of the soul to God, where unity comes from being
absorbed into the ultimate monolithic One. Worship is not a striving after
nirvana.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship does not call
for making ourselves into zeros replaced by the Spirit. Worship does not reduce
us to instruments by which God in the person of the Spirit speaks to himself. Glossolalia
destroys worship if it means that we do not even know what we are saying. It cannot
be communication. Worship disallows self-negation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship is directed
to God</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. It is not attention-getting
behavior aimed at any audience for display. Worship should not feel like <u>performance</u>,
where the stress falls on eloquence, the lack of mistakes, polished production.
Performance implies “Look at me,” “Praise Me.” There may be nothing wrong with
performance as such and there may be nothing wrong with performance even with
religious music; but in such cases, it is not called worship lest it replace
worship. Art expresses something captivating, arresting, impressive for the observer’s
advantage more than the performer’s praise. Performance art in a worship
setting changes the experience from worship to self-aggrandizement or audience
benefit. Emphasis must fall, not on aesthetics, but on power to accomplish the
upward purpose. Any concern for accuracy or “quality” is to avoid detracting
from that purpose and for enhancing it naturally. The concern is not primarily
for technical proficiency, but for having the heart in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship is addressed
to God as a person</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Stressing the interpersonal
nature of worship tempers any tendency to overly exalt God. Exalting him too
far loses personal contact with him. Mariolatry and saintly intercession
likewise push God away. The same can be said of the confessional and priestly
intercession as a means of getting through to God. The more stress there is on
priestly, saintly, and Marian mediation, the farther away <u>God</u> becomes
from putting them between the worshiper and the Lord.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The prohibition against
idolatry comes from the fact that an idol depersonalizes God. Looking at a
lifeless statue fosters the sense of a lifeless god, even though in theory the
idol or icon only represents the reality beyond it or serves as the dwelling
place of the deity within it. (1) Besides causing the worshiper to misconceptualize
the deity as an animal or human being, the idol also obscures personhood
because of what it is made of—wood, stone, gold, or silver. (2) That problem
compounds even more basic difficulties stemming from the fact that producing
the statue (Acts <b>17</b>:29), being able to move it around, being able to
leave its presence creates a sense of superiority to it, ability to manipulate
it, ability of avoiding it. Idolatry makes god a projection of human
imagination in contrast to his coming to us from beyond. <u>God is a person,
not a thing</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship is directed
to God as a person, not as a force</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>.
God as person differs from god as force. Conceiving of him as a force leads to
emotionalism, which is self-centered, individualistic, and person-thing rather
than I-Thou. It strives to experience a zing or exhilaration by way of ecstasy,
frenzy, psychological release from problems, or emotional detachment from the
world. The Spirit gets misconceptualized as a mysterious energy or a force
field, and worship means entering that force field or getting on the right “wave
length.” <u>God is a person, not a force</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship is directed
to God as person, not idea</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. He is not
the symbol of perfection, the principle of order, or the symbolic answer for
the unknown. So, worship is not meditation. <u>God is a person, not an idea</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The criterion for
worship is what keeps it interpersonal. Beyond that, worship must be outward
and upward directed instead of impersonal, horizontal, or internal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship must balance
form and spontaneity</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Form in worship
need only be present sufficiently to make the experience orderly so other
persons are not distracted from God while trying to worship him. When the form
becomes so elaborate that the worshiper worries more about it than God, the
ritual becomes counterproductive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship does not
require any particular form</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. If
worship is interpersonal, the only patterns are those natural to the
relationship. It is appropriate for God to call for certain forms of worship such
as the Lord’s Supper. The forms of worship can be generated by the worshipers
because they can determine what they mean by them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Worship proscribes
inappropriate forms</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. Examples are
those contrary to God’s character or to relationship with him: idolatry, human
sacrifice, debauchery. Positive commandment would be necessary for eliminating
any practice that is not contrary to first principles. Worshipers do well to be
cautious about matters that might be culturally tainted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interpersonal does not
mean that people cannot use impersonal instruments to express worship. Giving someone
a flower is giving them something impersonal, but the giving itself is interpersonal.
Mowing someone’s yard when the person is sick is an interpersonal act done for
that person. Even language, the voice, sound, postures are all impersonal items
used for relational purposes. In fact, all interpersonal activity uses what itself
is impersonal to express one person’s self to another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this light,
prohibiting the use of an instrument in worship cannot rest on its own lack of
interpersonal character, a reason from <u>the nature of the case</u> for God’s prohibiting
it. Besides the distinction between what <u>is</u> worship and what is used <u>to
express</u> worship, there is a distinction between what is worship and what <u>accompanies</u>
worship. We might as well note that not all Christian music is worship music if
we define worship as directed to God. A high percentage of songs is directed to
other people for teaching and encouragement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As to a New Testament
basis for non-instrumentalism, interpersonalism arises again in connection with
<u>the nature of the New Testament</u> and the hermeneutic to be applied. Our
understanding makes the New Testament an interpersonal communication written on
the heart rather than rules written on tablets of stone, rather than a
constitution that operates like a legal code. In legal matters, by its very
silence a constitution may prohibit what it does not contain (depending on what
it is dealing with even here). Only specified processes can have validity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Confusion about the
nature of the New Covenant demonstrates itself in the idea that the New
Testament is as much a constitution for the church as the Old Testament was a
law for Israel. The legalism that results in matters of worship and elsewhere is
unfortunate.</span></p>
