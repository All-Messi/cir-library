<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Interpersonalism”
refers to interaction between persons, mutual relations, compenetration,
mutuality, transaction. Interpersonal unity is the kind of thing John expresses
with his a-in-b-in-a formula (<i>e.g</i>., John <b>10</b>:38; <b>14</b>:10, 11,
15-16, 20, 23, 38; <b>15</b>:4-9; <b>17</b>:21-24; 1 John<b> 2</b>:24-28; see
also Colossians<b> 1</b>:27-28). Paul speaks about being <i>“members of one
another”</i> (Ephesians <b>4</b>:25). Interpersonalism contrasts with law,
ritual (sacramentalism), nature (materialism), idea (rationalism), and
mysticism. The ordinances are performative; they are acts by which we “say
something” more than “means of grace’ that we get from them. By them we say
something by what we do (cp. Titus<b> 1</b>:16). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is envisioned
approximates Martin Buber’s “I-Thou” expression. “I-Thou” stresses the individuals
in relationship. The “we” concept may be preferable since we are<i> “friends of
God” </i>(2 Chronicles <b>20</b>:7; Isaiah <b>41</b>:8; James <b>2</b>:23; note
Jesus and his disciples: John <b>15</b>:13-15; cp. Luke <b>12</b>:4 as well as
Matthew <b>11</b>:19, <i>etc</i>.). There may be affinities also between
interpersonalism and the view of the common-sense philosophers and Bostonian
personalism. Interpersonalism correlates with Kohlberg’s post-conventional
thinking because it calls for people to live by principles instead of gut
reactions, rules and regulations, or cultural conventions. Paul Tournier’s “The
Personalism of the Bible” is referred to by Lloyd John Ogilvie in <i>The Cup of
Wisdom</i> (Baker, [l972] 1985), p72. Note also Henry Van Dyke, <i>Gospel for
an Age of Doubt</i>, pp. 64-65 and James G. Van Buren’s statement in T. H.
Johnson’s “The Lord of the Early Christians” (1954), p. 32.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> I. The Scope of Interpersonalism: Holistic</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A.  Interpersonalism
addresses all people, that is, as many as are persons. It requires positive
relationship <u>between people</u>. Interpersonalism establishes the validity
of the individual. Reality does not lie with the group aside from the
individual. The group combines individuals to form a gestalt that equals more
than the sum of the individuals. A group cannot gain some sort of validity or
value aside from the individuals that comprise it. There is unity,
compenetration of personalities, and reciprocal influence unto mutual change by
degrees over time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Nevertheless,
individuals retain their individuality. They do not get lost as unidentifiable
units within a group. They retain their ability to influence, and be influenced
by, a distinct other. Simultaneously they have individual and corporate
identity. Interpersonalism avoids the two extremes of unrelated individuals
(chaos) and the undifferentiated One. It calls for unity between individuals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonalism
establishes the <u>logical relationship</u> of individuals to the group. The
group does not precede the individual nor <i>vice versa</i>; they are
coterminal. The individual joins the group through <u>identification</u>. Identification
may occur in a rite of passage that focalizes it, but identification is primarily
an interpersonal act and process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonal holism
militates against egocentric and ethnocentric behavior as well as classes based
on non-interpersonal considerations. It does not foster elitism in any form. Interpersonalism
avoids <u>self</u>-centeredness by the reciprocal mechanism. The tendency away
from interpersonalism in the Western world shows itself in an unreal,
individualism and in preoccupation with egalitarianism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonalism
avoids <u>ethno</u>centricity by the reciprocal mechanism (see under reciprocal
below). The individual neither follows nor precedes the group or any other
individual, because the actions do not go in just one direction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  For the same reason
that interpersonalism militates against egocentrism it militates against
self-negation, or <u>other</u>-centeredness. Neither the self nor the other is
negated or absolutized. So, we do not destroy the individual to have the whole
(Eastern religious thought), to depersonalize the other to have the self (<u>ego</u>centrism),
or negate the self to have the other (<u>allo</u>centrism). Individuals can be
distinct, can relate, and can act reciprocally to create unity within the
group. Interpersonalism shows the relationship between the one and the many. The
other can be more important, greater, and so on, but the other is not
absolutized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Not only is there <u>interaction</u>
back and forth, but that <u>reciprocation</u> takes the form of <u>interdependency</u>
as well as mutual edification. Inasmuch as there is <u>mutual influence</u>,
there is also <u>compenetration</u> of personalities. There is what has been
called “transaction,” where change can be caused on each by the other, which is
more than “interaction.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  A group is a <u>gestalt</u>,
where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. The superaddita include
unity, reciprocation, interdependency, corporate personality, shared influence
toward the outside as well as among the compenetrating individuals within the
group. Interpersonalism stresses the viewpoint of the whole without losing the
identity of the individual in the process. Interpersonalism avoids
reductionism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B. Christian
interpersonalism calls for positive association between <u>vertical and
horizontal personal relationships</u>. Hermitage, monasticism, cloistered and
ascetic life are not natural to the holism between all forms and ranks of
persons. (See also “Two Basic Points About Baptism.”)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            C. Interpersonalism
incorporates <u>all</u> aspects of the individual person. It subsumes the
individual person under it and requires positive relationship between elements <u>within
a person</u> if for no other reason than to enable harmonious association with
those beyond oneself. Interpersonalism includes all aspects of reality (being,
action, and relationship) and all levels of it (inorganic, organic, personal,
and social). Those additional elements may not be included <u>in</u> the entity
itself, but they are under the responsibility of interpersonal. Interpersonalism
is holistic because it involves (1) all the aspects of each individual person
and brings them to bear on (2) associations with all other persons. It
incorporates (3) all levels of reality and sets the stage for the <u>use</u> of
(4) all categories of things—law, logic, and nature inclusively. Interpersonalism
deals with the highest and most complex form of reality; so it is <u>holistic</u>
and synthetic like persons instead of analytical and reductionist. Activities
in one aspect of people’s life bleed off into other aspects of themselves and their
associations. One reciprocating pattern sets off side effects through related
reciprocating patterns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  The holistic character
of Christian interpersonalism contrasts sharply with all forms of
fragmentation—ethnocentrism, egocentrism, and spirit-matter dualism. The
contrasts with spirit-matter dualism distinguished Christianity from Greek and
Eastern hypostatic dualism and the behaviors, agenda, and practices that grew
from it. Stoicism represented the ascetic approach, which disdained the flesh,
while Epicureanism satiated the flesh, because flesh and spirit could supposedly
not affect each other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Unfortunately, in the
history of the church, Christianity came to reflect the dualistic approach in
its more stoic form, which led to asceticism, monasticism, the doctrine of
natural depravity, the practices of flagellation, celibacy, celibacy in
marriage, the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, her immaculate
conception, and the like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Because of its
holistic nature, interpersonalism has a strong integrative capacity. It does
not depend on any outward, or physical, circumstance like <u>place</u> (John <b>4</b>:20-23
re worship). It is not limited to any <u>time</u> frame. Interpersonalism takes
place despite the flux of external factors wherever persons exist. Interpersonalism
establishes proper use of ideas, physical reality, and legal process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Because of its
holistic nature, interpersonalism is not subject to entropy or the law of
diminishing returns. For that reason, Paul can say that spiritual things are
eternal; they do not perish with the using (Colossians <b>2</b>:12). Personal
relationships have growth potential.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> II. Viewpoints in Interpersonalism: Objective
and Subjective</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As to the holistic
perspective, an individual lives from a viewpoint within the system (imminence)
rather than looking at it from the outside or from above it (transcendence). The
individual and the individual’s group, on the one hand, and other persons or
groups, on the other hand, have a legitimate place in that whole. That means the
individual does not dissolve the “other” by subordinating it and its value;
that would constitute egocentrism and ethnocentrism. On the contrary, a person
does not have to dissolve the “self” by “getting out of the way.” Keeping the
individual and the other in balance is the only appropriate way to operate in
holistic fashion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Since the difference between
objective and subjective can break down, interpersonalism can take that into
account in a relationship as long as the attitude and motive are not defective.
Sincerity counts for something. Paul told the Corinthians, <i>“If the readiness
is there, it is acceptable as people have, not as they do not have”</i> (2
Corinthians <b>8</b>:12). <i>“As people think in their heart, so they are” </i>(Proverbs<b>
23</b>:7). Abraham’s intent to obey in the offering of Isaac met God’s
essential requirement without the outward follow-through. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The objective-subjective
variable sets up the difference between how people have acted and how other people
regard them. It can also put “guilt” in abeyance until the other persons become
aware that what they did was wrong. Then they become responsible for repentance
and restitution. So, interpersonalism can allow a significant role for <u>motive</u>
and <u>attitude</u> without vitiating the aims of the process.                         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. Manner of Operation: Direct</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Interpersonal operation
takes place directly between the persons. Its processes do not depend on any
third factor for their validity, effectiveness, or propriety. Christianity does
not require, or even allow, for an institution or some third party to
legitimize proclamation, administer ordinances, absolve sins, or originate
doctrine. The interpersonal character of the faith automatically sets aside the
formal clergy concept and the post-apostolic dictum: <i>“Where the bishop is,
there is the church.”</i> Instead, the persons in Christ are themselves a <i>“nation
of priests”</i> (Revelation <b>5</b>:10; cp.<b> 1</b>:6; <b>20</b>:6; 1 Peter<b>
2</b>:5, 9).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> IV. The Pattern of Interpersonalism: Reciprocity</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A. Active</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonalism deals
with reality in motion; it is not static. Interpersonalism takes hold of
change, viewing it as an opportunity for improvement. Heraclitus of Ephesus
enunciated the intriguing dictum that the only thing that is permanent is
change. The important thing is process, in this case, interpersonal relating. Interpersonalism
seeks security, not in static being or substance, but in active social
relations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            B. Qualitative</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonalism gets
away from a purely quantitative approach to things and incorporates the <u>qualitative
element</u>. Examples of qualitative matters include intentionality, attitude,
sincerity. Law, nature, and logic operate in a more quantitative, categorical,
binary, either-or manner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonal process
does not quantify the elements in its operation. The Christian system does not
specify how many times we forgive a fellow Christian (Matthew <b>18</b>:21-22),
how many times a day we pray, how many times a week we fast (Luke<b> 18</b>:12),
what amount or percent of our resources we contribute, how many times a week we
“go to church.” The New Covenant calls for governing these matters by need,
opportunity, capacity, circumstance, and interest. We determine such matters
for ourselves as reflections of our devotion and commitment to the other Person
and his people.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            C. Degree</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Interpersonalism is
subject to <u>degree;</u> so there can be increase or decrease in the continuum.
The degree capacity shows itself in the sanctification process and in social
change generally. Since it is not binary, categorical, or either-or, a person
can become.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            D. Reciprocal Causation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Degree becomes
possible by reciprocation. Reciprocation means that A affects B, which turns
around and affects A. <u>Reciprocation</u> is two-directional unlike the <u>domino
effect</u> (straight-line causal series) or a pattern like <u>thesis-antithesis-synthesis</u>
(Hegelianism, dialecticism). In the latter, the new synthesis may react with a
new antithesis that merges with it into another synthesis, and so on. Two-directional
causation means that the process can start from either pole in the
relationship. Interpersonal reciprocal causation represents the most complex
causal pattern and incorporates into its purview lesser patterns like
straight-line causal series and dialecticism. Popular terms for reciprocation
are “vicious cycle” (if moving in a negative direction), the “spiral effect,” “the
snowball effect,” circular causation, transaction, interaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Because of its
reciprocal format, interpersonalism avoids infinite regress. An infinite
regress presupposes a straight-line causal series (chain reaction, domino
effect) characteristic of so many impersonal processes. Infinite regress may
apply to thesis-antithesis-synthesis format also. The reciprocal process in
interpersonal relationship is nicely expressed in the term <u>one another</u>
and similar expressions (note Gene Getz’s little book of yesteryear <i>Building
Up One Another</i>. Wheaton, Ill.: Victor Books, l976):</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Reciprocation can
involve mutual change. <u>Circular causality</u> is a term sometimes used here
although it is not entirely appropriate. When the causation comes back around,
it comes around on a higher plane, reflecting the change that has occurred in
the interaction. That spiral effect can occur because choice exists in both
poles of interaction. There is potential change on <u>both</u> sides instead of
just one. So, interpersonal reciprocation avoids the determinism in
stimulus-response causation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  One example of
reciprocation shows up in the interaction between love and hope. Colossians<b>
1</b>:4-5 speaks of love coming from hope. It is equally clear in the
faith-hope-love set that love creates trust that brings hope. Colossians <b>1</b>:9-10
assumes the pattern of reciprocal causation when the text begins with knowledge
that leads to walking that leads to increased knowledge. A similar pattern
appears in 2 Peter<b> 1</b>:5-8, where the apostle starts out adding knowledge
to virtue and adding self-control (<i>etc</i>.) to knowledge with the result of
being fruitful unto the knowledge of Christ. Everyday examples of reciprocation
are feedback between an amplifier and a guitar, the interaction between a
furnace and thermostat, the development of topsoil, and symbiotic relationships
between pairs of living things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            An interpersonal system moves
forward by influence rather than by force, authority, or form. “Influence”
refers to the way one person affects another. Influence is exerted through distinctively
personal capacities. One person can affect another by <u>communicatin</u>g <u>ideas</u>
in <u>logical</u> fashion, thus appealing to the <u>rational capacity</u>
persons share. A person can weep with those who weep, thus expressing the <u>emotional
capacity</u> that persons have. People can <u>care</u> about and show <u>concern</u>
for other people by spending time, offering help, giving resources, “putting
themselves in the other person’s shoes.” Such acts involve the <u>volitional
capacity</u> because nothing is forcing the person to get involved in the life
of the other. As a result of such outward-directedness, the second person may freely
change attitudes, beliefs, and actions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Influence relates to <u>conditionality</u>
as distinguished from causation. One person may offer to help another, but that
benefactor may require certain actions of the other that do not aid in bringing
about the benefit needed, which the benefactor gives. Those requested actions
indicate “good faith”; so the persons in need through those conditions show they
are not trying to take advantage of other people’s benevolence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Influence contrasts with
various kinds of determinism. One such determinism is <u>natural force</u>,
where no choosing is going on within the “object” affected. Natural forces hold
natural processes together, and they do so in a way that eliminates
indeterminacy (except the Heisenberg principle) because choice is not involved.
<u>Logic</u> holds rational processes together in a way that gives validity. Authority
holds legal processes together in a way that the only variability involved may
come only because of the persons carrying out the law. Even then the only legal
variation that can occur is within the specifications of the law. Law, nature,
and logic are deterministic systems that contrast with influence, because they
do not involve free will. Because of free will in social process, no one-to-one
relationship exists between the influence and the response. There is “slippage”
in the system and, therefore, a degree of unpredictability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            As a result of slippage, social
processes have flexibility. Things do not “have” to be a certain way. Actions are
appropriate rather than necessary. Appropriate variation is bounded by effects
on the other and by effectiveness toward the common goal other persons share.
Furthermore, the operations are reversible when the natural requirements of the
relationship cease to be the case on either side of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                  Because
interpersonalism is holistic and flexible, it is also highly complex. This
analysis of interpersonalism takes away much of the mystery of persons, but it
does not remove all the mystery. There is a degree of mystery about persons and
about relationships between them, because people as volitional creatures have creativity,
which reduces predictability.          </span></p>

not so precise as to “when.” They involve more “gray areas.” Interpersonalism
is not time-referenced. When people enter a relationship, they give no thought

time passage means that we do not have the degree of time-when exactness as exists
in miracle or law. If salvation is an interpersonal process, we do not expect
it to have a pinpoint time-when. Establishing a friendship is not something
that has a specific time-when exactness. Salvation does involve decision and commitment,
which occur at a relatively more precise time than becoming a friend does, but
they have a “looser” time-when than miraculous conversion or legal enactment, which
are the alternatives proposed for the conversion and salvation process.

people do not change over time. They are permanent and universal, having a

conform to the nature of the case. Legal processes are valid even when they do
not fit the situation very well, because their validity depends on authority
rather than on conformity to what is real (true). Christianity relies on
reality instead of rules because rules are too approximate and too rigid for what
the New Covenant addresses: interpersonal reconciliation to fellowship with God
and other people.</span></p>
