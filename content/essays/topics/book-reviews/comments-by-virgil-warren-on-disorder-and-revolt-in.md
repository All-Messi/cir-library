4, entitled “Disorder and Revolt,” addresses the impact of sinning on thinking
as one aspect of depraved behavior generally. Perverted thought amidst general
depravity connects in turn with university, most relevantly to formal Christian
university as part of the over-all Christian enterprise mandated in the Great
Commission (cosmopolitanism).</span></p>

approach traces the depravity phenomenon from elements in the thought of
Aristotle through Aquinas to Lonergan, taking notice of Augustine and the
Reformed tradition along the way—without necessarily appealing to the
hypostatic and legal elements of their theories of sin as distinct from
phenomenology. </span></p>

<u>suppresses</u> information it does not find convenient for what it wants to
maintain (note “blind spot,” “scotosis”; 98). It cherry-picks data to obtain
favorable, predetermined conclusions. It refuses to listen to “the rest of the story.”
It matches Paul’s observation that people refuse to have God in their knowledge
(Romans <b>1</b>:28). Denial is usually easier than providing evidence.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Sinning
<u>equivocates</u> unlike things to create the desired conclusions. The practice
appears in political debates. In the controversy over publicly funding
abortions, for example, abortion—late-term and all—gets subsumed under women’s
health. Of course, pregnancy is not a disease that a person has some right to
be healed from like the mumps. Rare cases involving a mother’s life become
highlighted so as to draw attention away from the vast majority of unwanted
pregnancies due to sexual immorality. A fetus is not like a tumor someone might
want removed; tumors have no potential for human functioning. Pregnancies from
rape and incest become emotionally laden calls to justifying abortions
generally. The thought pattern departs from the legal principle that hard cases
make bad law.</span></p>

shows up, as well, in contemporary efforts to normalize homosexual behavior by
making it analogous to the race issue in the American past, and any objecting
to the sexual behavior is painted as hate speech in order to silence objection.
Of course, race is not a chosen act between persons; yet the behavior is
pressed for acceptance under that comparison. Guilt on another front is used to
stymie resistance to this matter.</span></p>

tries to construct the discussion to make the other view shoulder the <u>negative

ill-founded claim, which is often something that cannot be done because

 In discussions of depravity, the words <i>nature</i>, <i>being</i>, <i>sin</i>
can be unclear, because they seem to mean ontic nature (“stuff”) in some cases,
and characteristic behavior in others: “man’s nature includes his ability to
think”; vs. “he’s grumpy all the time; that’s just his nature.” The phenomenological
language advocated in this presentation can avoid that imprecision. More
importantly it can avoid reification and faculty psychology, and consequently those
biblically unwarranted inferences that root depraved behavior in biologically
inheritable hypostasis, an idea that originated in non-biblical, Greek philosophy.
That last mental leap from word to referent unnecessarily foments a plethora of
complicated theological maneuvers and hermeneutical turns that can impugn
divine self-consistency and holiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            B.
Phenomenological language still requires avoiding the reification that is not
easily overcome by language usage itself. Adopting phenomenological language does
allow every act to be regarded as a cluster of compenetrating and
interdependent facets (cp. 95, ¶4). A choosing event, for example, is not
something a “will” does; willing refers to an “experience” that includes
thinking ideas or purposes as well having feelings that better move the willing.
People use the word <i>will</i> without ever having seen one; hence, the word
really comes from an act event, not a thing—it may get reified if the speaker
leaps to an unexperienced, postulated referent he considers a “something.” But,
that is not what caused the <u>word</u> to come into usage or what caused the
person to use it in a given case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Mind,
will, and the various appetites can be left as mental abstractions just like
being, action, and relationship are; they are “meta-physicals” in the mind
aside from whether there are one-for-one correlations in the real “physical.” Phenomenological
speech leaves the speaker free, then, to suspend judgment on the ontology
involved. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>C.
Phenomenological language can serve as a corrective in articulating the
Christian faith. The exhortation is to get beyond the terminology, to the
thought beyond the words, beyond language—reality thinking. Adjusting the
linguistic issue does not automatically correct the proper awareness of the
referent. One way to get beyond the gap between language and referent, idea and
reality, metaphysics and “physics,” is to be comfortable with not knowing
exactly what the ontic referent is. We can get to where we need to go without
understanding how an internal combustion engine works. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That
is something a Christian can do because he has decided to trust at the
functional level the One who is source of all knowledge and has revealed
sufficient knowledge for that functioning—as summed up in interpersonal
behavior: love. Furthermore, it is something we do not have to understand for
the practical function of life. “The wayfaring man, though a fool, need not
err” in what matters between people, and between people and God—together with
the responsibilities involved. He is free in his ontic postulations to
hypothesize and research, using practical outcomes to test our theoretical
pursuits and revelation as a curb and guide on what makes sense. He knows and
understands enough for practical purposes, which after all is the point anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Being
created in the image of an interpersonal God, we can infer that our summarizing
characteristic is interpersonal capacity along with all the attendant
behaviors, goals, and relationships that pertain thereunto.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            D.
Commonly writers speak of mankind’s original state as morally <u>good</u>
(original “justice/just-ness” as in Aquinas? 87-88), perhaps as a take-off on God’s
comment that his creation was “very good” (Genesis <b>1</b>:31). The expression
speaks more generally, however, in that it describes God’s whole creative work,
most of which was impersonal—and morality applies only to personal beings. So
“good” does not describe morally good, but functionally good in being able to
conform to the purpose these creations were to serve. Beginning with morally <u>neutral</u>
allows good <u>and</u> evil to “become” by action. That works better because an
act cannot be created anyway (only indirectly with deterministic creations). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
approach allows for pervertible neutrality within limited freedom, and most
significantly provides the way to remove God from being the creator of evil;
instead, evil can become action and be perpetuated through “the free will of
secondary agencies” (Satan as “father of lies”; John <b>8</b>:44). The task of
the theologian becomes understanding how sin among mankind is (a) universal,
(b) all-pervasive, (c) and inescapable. From the standpoint of revelation, any
use of sanctified imagination must begin with the information and necessary
inferences from it as regards human ontology, and end up allowing for these
three features of anthropology and soteriology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>E.
Drawing attention to the noetic effects of sin points up the observation that
formal education—even formal Christian education—<u>contributes</u> to
education for life—education for use—rather than <u>conveys</u> the whole of
what is needed. Formal education most easily addresses noetic matters, but
people are more than information repositories and reasoning machines, and the
accompanying factors in the real situation mean that the noetic aspect is
affected by sinning just as surely as the others. Education for the whole
person has to be carried forward by the living church, the indwelt body of
Christ (interpersonalism). In other words <u>university</u> has to be broadened
to something synonymous with the Great Commission (cosmopolitanism), where apprenticeship,
internship, family, and daily interpersonal Christian living are vehicles of
education properly so called.            </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Otherwise,
the Christian “university” ends up doing with education what science often
tries to do with methodological naturalism. “Science” goes beyond its appropriate
realm (observable, recurrent, natural process) and tries to arrogate to itself
the role of lone purveyor of truth. That automatically eliminates unobservable,
one-time, and supernatural occurrence, and ends up with inadequate, artificial
conclusions. Scientism absolutely disallows supernatural causation because “it
is not scientific,” as if that were a relevant critique. Such “begging the
question” represents empiricism gone awry in science falsely so-called.</span></p>

<u>Being</u> (“stuff”), <u>action</u>, and <u>relationship</u> are three
necessary, compenetrating, interdependent components in every “event.” </span></p>

Of the above three, being—and to some extent relationship—is creatable; action
is not.</span></p>

The creatable endowments of humankind can be summarized under <u>mind</u>
(noetic), <u>will</u> (volitional), and <u>appetites</u> (affections/desires/drives/appetites/emotions)
(cp. Aristotle; 96, ¶1).</span></p>

Sin is a chosen behavior between persons relative to a standard of behavior
that is figured relative to nature and purpose. That means it is not a
substance or a deformity (privation) in the form of substance relative to
pristine condition (Augustine).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>10.
Scripture deals almost exclusively with the functional level as to what is good
or bad. It gives little information about the creatable elements of “stuff”
that makes possible the various endowments it assumes in establishing its
expectancies and giving its directives—the “mechanics” of the <i>imago dei</i>.
So to speak, scripture enters the situation through the front door on the
ground floor of the human condition without explaining how God laid the
foundation to make possible the human endowments and expectancies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>11.
Scripture gives no indication that humankind differed in moral capacity after
the Fall—whether by natural result of sin or by divine curse for it—than what
that capacity was before the Fall in a biologically inheritable sense—although
some scriptures have been accommodated to that end (contrast 88, ¶4; 99, ¶3). The
situation partakes of the dictum that acquired characteristics are not
inherited (sinfulness).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>12.
Sinning is sufficiently explained by the clustered interaction of three morally
neutral factors: (a) <u>viewpoint of consciousness</u> (time and place), (b) <u>psycho-physical
drives</u>/appetites/ desires/affections/emotions, and (c) the <u>interpersonal
capacity</u>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Morally neutral,
creatable factors come from grace. So “nature is not separated from grace” (90,
¶3); grace provides all things not produced by the created self; grace is not just
for correcting faults that person produces. “Sufficiently explained” contrasts
with additionally invoking the hypostatic and legal categories into the
explanation for universal, all-pervasive, inescapable sin—inescapable as to
power, penalty, and presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>13.
The three sufficient factors are all pervertible by free-will action that <u>originates</u>
and <u>perpetuates</u> the sinning phenomenon in the very beginning and all
along the way with each person. The factors can be variously used, mis-used,
and ab-used; free will is a potential concomitant with creating moral capacity
and necessary for avoiding determinism. Sinning takes the neutral and means it
for negative. </span></p>

fulfilling way to meet. (cp. “nature fails in nothing necessary,” Aristotle;
