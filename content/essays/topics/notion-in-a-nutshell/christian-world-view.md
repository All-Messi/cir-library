The basic reality in Christianity is interpersonalism. God is personal, and everything else and everyone else derive from him by his creation. Interpersonalism is the most complex reality there is. It stands in contrast to nature, law, and ideas (metaphysics). Interpersonalism operates by love, nature by natural law, law by authority, and metaphysics by form.
