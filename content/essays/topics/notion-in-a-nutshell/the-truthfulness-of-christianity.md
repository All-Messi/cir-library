The resurrection of Christ and the existence of the church stand or fall together. If he did not resurrect, the church would never have come into existence, because <em>“Messiah abides forever.”</em> The church exists, so Christ must have arisen. Something so obviously supernatural as his resurrection verifies the claims of Christ. The church is a person-centered system, centered on the person of Christ. If he is taken out of the way, the system collapses.
