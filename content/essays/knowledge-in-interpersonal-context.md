KNOWLEDGE IN INTERPERSONAL CONTEXT

1. Peace that passes understanding: Philippians 4:7

2. I am the way, the truth, and the life [truth is personal]

(note: “You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”)

3. Knowledge puffs up; love builds up. [It does so by stressing relationships, whereas knowledge fosters distinctions between us.]

4. If anyone among you thinks he knows anything, let him know that he does not yet know what he should know.

5. That you might know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge (note underline word play) Ephesians 3:19
