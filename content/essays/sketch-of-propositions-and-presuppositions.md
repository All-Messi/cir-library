<strong>on the use of 2 Samuel 7:14 in Hebrews <sup>1:5</sup>b</strong>




I.	While 2 Samuel <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:14 must refer to Solomon because Solomon so understood it (1 Kings<strong> 6</strong>:11-13; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:17-21), it cannot refer exclusively to him since the context speaks of an eternal seed (2 Samuel <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:16).


II.	By the nature of the case, there can be only one universal eternal kingdom.  So Daniel <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:(35) 44; Psalm <strong><sup>89</sup></strong>:27 + 4, 36; and therefore the universal kingdom of Psalm <strong><sup>2</sup></strong> (first quotation) and the eternal kingdom of Psalm <strong><sup>110</sup></strong> (last quotation) must all refer to the same thing as the eternal kingdom of 2 Samuel <strong><sup>7</sup></strong> (as well as Psalm <strong><sup>89</sup></strong>; Isaiah<strong> 9</strong>; <em>etc</em>.).


Without hands (Daniel <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:34-35) means "from/by God" (cp. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:25). This expression and this context in Daniel is probably in the Hebrews writer's mind, because he uses it elsewhere (<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:11, 24; cp. Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:58; Acts <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:48; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:24; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:1; Ephesians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11; Colossians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11). The phraseology occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament.


III.  	Seed is collective for the whole Davidic dynasty as a series, rather than individual for Solomon alone. Psalm <strong><sup>89</sup></strong>:29-30ff, a Psalm parallel to 2 Samuel <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>, interprets seed as descendants. All the third personal singulars in 2 Samuel <strong><sup>7</sup></strong> are grammatical consequents of the word seed. <em>He</em>, <em>his</em>, and <em>him</em> are grammatically third person singular references to the collective noun seed, rather than <em>he</em> as in Solomon. The successive collective descendants of David in turn fill the slot called "seed" with the Messiah as son par excellence.





IV. 	The approach is exegetical; its meaning is derivable from the Old Testament text by the principles of interpretation. The approach is not like taking 2 Samuel as one of the following formats:




A.	A reference to two different things at once





B.  Type to antitype




C.  Accommodation




Note: Biblical interpretation uses no principle that is not found in human language generally (<em>contra</em>, <em>e.g</em>., Milligan<em>, New Testament Commentary on Hebrews</em>, p. 60). A person, for example, may intend more in a statement than a hearer can derive from it (as in type-antitype), but that is not the case in this use of 2 Samuel <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:14. The point made can be derived from the Old Testament through the principles of hermeneutics; so revelation is not necessary to understand this Old Testament text in the way the Hebrew writer takes it.
