PARTICLES

("Particles" is a loose category that is not uniformly defined among Greek scholars.  Some include in particles everything but nouns, pronouns, and verbs (A. T. Robertson); other include only the intensifying short words; many include prepositions, conjunctions, negatives, and modal adverbs.)

Enclitics  [gev, a[n, mevn, pevr, rJav]

Postpositive  [dhv, gev, mevn, pevr, toiv]

Non-enclitic particles  [[a[ra, toigavr (toiv + ge + a[ra) toinu'n, nhv, naiv, ei| mhvn, ouj, mhv, mh; ouj]

EXPLETIVES
