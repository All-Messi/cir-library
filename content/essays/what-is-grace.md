## Definition

**Grace** is God's unmerited favor toward humanity. It is a gift that cannot be earned or deserved.

## Key Aspects

Grace involves:

1. **God's Initiative** - Grace begins with God, not with us
2. **Undeserved Blessing** - We receive what we don't merit
3. **Salvation** - Grace is the means of our salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9)
4. **Ongoing Relationship** - Grace continues throughout our Christian life

## Grace vs. Merit

Unlike systems based on merit or works:
- Grace is **given**, not earned
- Grace is **generous**, not grudging  
- Grace is **relational**, not transactional

## Scripture References

> "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." - Ephesians 2:8-9

> "But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.'" - James 4:6

## In Practice

Grace transforms how we:
- **Approach God** - with confidence, not fear
- **View ourselves** - as loved, not condemned
- **Treat others** - with mercy, as we've received mercy
