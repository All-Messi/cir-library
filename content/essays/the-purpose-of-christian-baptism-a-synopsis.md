<strong>	CHRISTIANITY AS AN INTERPERSONAL “SYSTEM”	</strong>






Christian baptism is an interpersonal act in which a repentant believer identifies with Jesus Christ. On the basis of identity with Christ, God promises to forgive our sins, grant us the presence of his Spirit, and add us to Christ's body, the church.
