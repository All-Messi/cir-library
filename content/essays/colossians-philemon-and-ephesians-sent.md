COLOSSIANS, PHILEMON, AND EPHESIANS SENT

SIMULTANEOUSLY  (plus the letter to the Laodecians?)

All come from an imprisonment: Ephesians 3:1; 4:1; Colossians 4:3, 18; Philemon 1, 9-10

2.	The subject matter and style of language in Colossians and Ephesians are closer than any other two epistles of Paul.

a.  Household teaching: Ephesians 5:21-6:9; Colossians 3:18-4:1

b.  Putting the members to death

3.	The bearers are connected.

6:21  Ephesians

Tychicus

4:7  Colossians  4:9

Onesimus

Philemon  10

4.	The destinations are near one another: Philemon (from Colossae)  and

Colossians and Ephesians  (= Epistle to the Laodiceans?).
