11:15, 17-18; 12:10-12; 15:3-4; 19:1-2, 5, 6-8

B.	Simple vocabulary

C.	Numerological interest

1.	Threes: three measures of barley (6:6); three woes of three angels (8:13) = three plagues? (9:18); three unclean spirits (16:13); three gates on each side of the new Jerusalem (21:13); a third of the trees, sea, creatures, ships (8:8-9); a third of the rivers (8:10-11); a third of the sun, moon, stars not shining for a third of the day (8:12); a third of men (9:15); a third of the stars (12:4)

Sevens: seven spirits of the churches (1:4); seven churches (1:11) = seven lampstands (1:12); seven stars (1:16); seven horns and seven eyes (5:6); seven thunders (10:3); seven thousand people killed by an earthquake (11:13); seven heads of the red dragon (12:3); seven heads of the sea beast (13:1); seven heads of the scarlet beast (17:3)

D.  	Prevalence of Old Testament Imagery

E.	Highly Structured (like Dante’s Inferno)

1.	Cyclical pattern

a.	Heaven-earth pattern	heaven	earth

1:1-3:22

II. Message

A. Emphasis on the truth of things spoken

3:7, 14; 6:10; 15:3; 16:7; 19:2, 9, 11; 21:5; 22:6

B.	John’s personal witness of the events to come

“saw/see”: εἶδον in 1:2, 12, 17, 19, 202; 4:4; 5:1, 2; 6:1, 2, 9; 7:1, 2; 8:2; 9:1, 17; 10:1, 5; 13:1, 2; 14:6; 15:1; 16:13; 17:3, 62, 8, 12, 15, 18; 18:1; 19:11, 17, 19; 20:1, 4, 11, 12; 21:1, 2, 22; βλέπω in 1:11, 12; 6:1; 22:82; and εἶδω in 4:1; 6:8; 14:1, 14; 15:5; cp. John 1:1, 4, 9; 21:2; 22:8 (total of 58 times)

C.	Emphasis on imminence

The consummation of history is viewed as near, and the future history of the world as short: “shortly” in 1:1; 22:6; “quickly” in 3:11; 11:14; 22:7, 12, 20; “short time” in 12:2; 17:10; “near” (ἐγγύς, engys) in 1:3; 22:10; and “little time” (χρόνον μικρόν, chronon mikron) in 6:11.

D.	Preoccupation with the future

Even chapters 2-3 are slanted toward the judgment (1:19; 4:1; 9:13. etc.)

E.	Universal scope in time and territory

F.	Christological emphasis: eternality (1:4), deity (1:7 + 19:10; 22:6), power, and so

on.

G.	Emphasis on Christian maturity

H.	Ultimate, definite, full, and final triumph of God’s good over earth’s evil

Revelation gives three answers to the atheistic antilogism on God’s omnipotence, God’s holiness, and the fact of evil. The Christian God does not exist, so the argument proceeds, because one of the three elements above must be denied to have a consistent system. But Revelation reminds Christians that God was not the origin of evil. Satan by his free will was the ultimate source of it. God is responsible, however, and takes care of it in the following way: Christ provides the conquest of evil, and in the end evil will be overcome.  Until then God righteously gives opportunity for evil people to take advantage of the salvation provided by his omnipotence through the slain and resurrected Lamb.
