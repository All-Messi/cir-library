HOSEA

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1Messages from Yahveh to Hosea Ben-Beeri

at the Time of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah,

and Jeroboam Ben-Joash/Jehoash, King of Israel

Hosea’s Wife and Children

2When Yahveh spoke the first time through Hosea, he said, “Marry a prostitute and have children, because the land is committing flagrant prostitution by abandoning me.” 3So he married Gomer Bat Diblaim, and she had a son. 4Yahveh said,

“Name him Jezreel. Soon I’ll punish Jehu’s dynasty for the bloodshed in Jezreel, and put an end to Israel. 5At that time, I’ll break Israel’s military strength in the Valley of ‘Jezreel.’” 	Hos 1:1-5

6Then she had a daughter. Yahveh told him,

“Name her Lo-ruhamah. I ‘won’t have mercy’ any more on Israel by forgiving them. 7But I will have mercy on Judah and deliver them, but not by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”

8When she’d weaned Lo-ruhamah, she had another son. 9Yahveh said, “Name him Lo-ammi. You’re ‘not my people’ and I’m not your God.

10Yet the number of Israelites

will be like sand by the sea,

that you can’t measure or count.

Where I said, ‘You’re not my people,’

I’ll say, ‘You’re children of the living God.’

11Then Judah and Israel will unite

and appoint one leader.

They’ll return from the exile together

because the day of Jezreel [sowing] will be great.”	Hos 1:6-11

Israel’s Unfaithfulness Punished

2:1“In that day, you will call your brothers ‘Ammi’ [my people]

and your sisters ‘Ruhamah’ [the ones loved].’

2But for now, bring charges against your mother Israel

because she’s not my wife

and I’m not her husband.

Let her put away her prostitution,

the adultery from between her breasts.

3Otherwise, I’ll strip her naked

and expose her like the day she was born.

I’ll make her like a wilderness, like a desert;

she’ll die of thirst.

4I won’t have mercy on her children;

they’re children from prostitution.			Hos 2:1-4

5Their mother was a prostitute;

it was a shame the way she acted.

She said, ‘I’ll go after my lovers

that gave me bread and water,

wool and linen, olive oil and drink.’

6So I’ll plant thornbushes along the sides of her road

and build a wall across her path

so she can’t get to where she wants to go.

7She’ll chase after her lovers, but not catch them;

she’ll look for them, but not find them.

So she’ll say, ‘I’ll go back to my first husband,

because it was better for me then than now!’

8She doesn’t know I was the one

that gave her grain, new wine, and olive oil;

and lavished on her silver and gold—

which she used for Baal.		Hos 2:5-8

9So I’ll take back my grain at harvest time

and my new wine when it’s due.

I’ll take away the wool and linen

I gave her to cover her nakedness.

10I’ll uncover her lewdness

in front of her lovers,

and nobody will rescue her from me.

11I’ll put an end to her gaiety,

her festivals, new moons, Sabbaths,

and festive assemblies.

12I’ll destroy her grapevines and fig trees

that she claimed were

the pay her lovers gave her.

I’ll make them a thicket

where only wild animals can eat.

13I’ll punish her for the times when she was

offering sacrifices to the images of Baal,

adorning herself with earrings and jewelry,

following her lovers,

and forgetting about me,” 	Yahveh says.  	 	Hos 2:9-13

Yahveh’s Mercy on Israel

14“So I’ll win her back,

bring her into the desert,

and speak graciously to her.

15I’ll give her vineyards there

and the Valley of Achor as a gateway to hope.

She’ll sing there like she did when she was young,

when she first came up from Egypt.

16She’ll call me ‘Ishi’ [my husband], not ‘Baali’ [my lord].’

17I’ll take the many names of Baal out of her mouth;

she won’t mention them anymore.		Hos 2:14-17

18I’ll make a treaty for her with the animals in the field,

the birds in the sky, and what crawls on the ground.

I’ll banish bow, sword, and war from the land

so she can lie down in safety.

19I’ll engage her to me permanently

in goodness, justice, and 20faithfulness.

Then she’ll know Yahveh.

21At that time, I’ll answer the sky

that pleads for rain,

that will answer the earth,

22that will answer the grain, new wine, and olive oil

that will answer, ‘God has sown’ [Jezreel].

23I’ll sow her for myself in the land

and have mercy on her that hadn’t received mercy.

I’ll say to those who weren’t my people,

‘You’re my people [Ammi]!’

and they’ll say, ‘You’re my God [Elohai]!’”		Hos 2:18-23

Hosea’s Wife Redeemed

3:1Then Yahveh told me, “Go love your wife again even though she’s an adulteress—like I love Israel though it turns to other gods and loves raisin cakes.” 2So I bought her for 6 oz 15 shekels of silver and 5 bushels a lethek of barley. 3I told her, “You’ll have to stay with me a long time. You won’t carry on prostitution or belong to another man. I’ll be that way with you too.” 4That’s because the people in Israel will go a long time without king or prince, sacrifice or sacred pillar, ephod or household idols. 5Then they’ll come back and rely on Yahveh their God and David their king. They’ll come cringing to Yahveh and to his goodness in the end.                     	Hos 3:1-5

Yahveh Accuses Israel

4:1Israel, listen to Yahveh’s message;

he’s filing charges against you:

“There’s no faithfulness, kindness,

or awareness of God there.

2There’s swearing, deception, murder, stealing, and adultery;

they use violence, so there’s murder after murder.

3So the land is in mourning.

Everybody that lives in it is wasting away,

along with the animals in the field

and the birds in the sky;

even the fish are disappearing.”		Hos 4:1-3

4“But don’t anybody point a finger at somebody else;

I’m suing you priests.

5You’ll stumble in the daytime;

prophets will stumble with you at night;

I’ll destroy your mother Israel.

6My people are getting destroyed because they don’t know me.

Since you priests have refused to know me,

I’ll refuse to acknowledge you as my priests.

Since you’ve forgotten about my Law,

I’ll forget about your children.

7The more priests there are, the more they sin against me;

I’ll turn their honor into shame. 				Hos 4:4-7

8“They feed on my people’s sin

because their sacrifices for it

mean more food for the priests!

9It will be, like people like priest;

I’ll punish them for their ways,

repay them for their deeds.

10They’ll eat, but not have enough;

they’ll carry on prostitution, but won’t gain anything by it,

because they’ve stopped listening to Yahveh.

11Prostitution, wine, and new wine

have robbed my people of understanding.

Hos 4:8-11

12“My people consult their wooden idols;

their fortunetellers toss sticks to give them oracles.

A spirit of prostitution has led them astray;

they’ve carried on prostitution by leaving their God.

13They offer sacrifices to idols on mountaintops

and burn incense on hills

under oaks, poplars, and terebinth trees,

because they make pleasant shade.

That’s why your daughters become prostitutes

and your brides commit adultery.

14I won’t punish their daughters when they carry on prostitution

or their brides when they commit adultery,

because you men visit prostitutes

and offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes;

so you foolish people will be ruined. 			Hos 4:12-14

15“Though you carry on prostitution, Israel,

don’t draw Judah into your guilt.

Don’t go to Gilgal or up to Beth-aven [Bethel];

don’t swear, ‘As sure as Yahveh lives!’

16Israel is like a stubborn heifer;

so how can Yahveh feed it like a lamb in the pasture?

17Leave Ephraim alone

because she carries on idolatry.

18When their rulers are done drinking,

they go visit prostitutes;

they have no shame whatsoever.

19The wind will carry them off;

their altars will bring them disgrace.		Hos 4:15-19

Judgment Against Israel’s Leaders

5:1“Hear this, priests!

Pay attention, Israel!

Listen, family of the king!

Your idolatry at Mizpah has set a trap

and cast a net on Tabor.

2You rebels have gone deep in slaughter,

but I’ll punish you all for it.

3I know what you’re doing, Ephraim;

you can’t hide from me, Israel.

Ephraim, you’ve left me like a prostitute;

Israel, you’ve defiled yourself.

4Your deeds keep you from coming back to me.

You’re totally a prostitute;

you don’t know Yahveh.		Hos 5:1-4

5“Israel’s arrogance testifies against him;

Israel and Ephraim stumble under the weight of their guilt;

Judah stumbles with them.

6They’ll go with their flocks and herds

to seek Yahveh, but they won’t find him;

he’s withdrawn from them.

7They’ve dealt deviously with Yahveh

because they’ve borne illegitimate children.

Now the new moon will devour them along with their fields.

Hos 5:5-7

8“Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah;

blow the bugle in Ramah.

Sound an alarm at Beth-aven:

cringe, Benjamin!

9Ephraim will become a pile of rubble when he’s rebuked;

that’s for certain.

10Judah’s officials are like people that remove landmarks;

I’ll pour out my anger on them like a waterfall.

11Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed in condemnation,

because he was determined to follow vanity.

12So I’ll be like a moth in Ephraim,

like rot in Judah.

13“When Ephraim saw his sickness

and Judah saw his wound,

Ephraim went to Assyria;

he sent for King Jareb.

But he can’t heal you

or cure you from your wound.

14I’ll be like a lion to Ephraim,

like a young lion to Judah.

I’ll tear them to pieces

and take them away;

nobody will rescue them.

15I’ll go back to my place

till they admit their guilt and turn to me;

when trouble comes,

they’ll earnestly rely on me.”		 		Hos 5:8-15

Israel and Judah Unrepentant

6:1“They’ll say, ‘Let’s return to Yahveh.

He has torn us, but he’ll heal us;

he has wounded us, but he’ll bandage us up.

2He’ll revive us in two days,

and raise us up the third,

so we can live in his presence.

3So let’s press on to know Yahveh.

He’ll respond to us as sure as dawn comes;

he’ll come to us like rain,

like the spring rain that waters the ground.’		Hos 6:1-3

4“What am I going to do with you, Ephraim,

or with you, Judah?

Your loyalty is like a morning cloud,

like dew that evaporates early.

5I’ve cut both of you up in pieces by the prophets;

I’ve slain you with my words;

the condemnations on you are as inescapable as light.

6I delight in loyalty more than sacrifice,

in knowing me more than in burnt offerings.

7Like Adam you’ve broken covenant

and dealt deceitfully with me.

8“Gilead is a city of sinners,

tracked with bloody footprints.

9Like raiders waiting for victims,

a band of priests commits murder on the way to Shechem;

and every shameful crime imaginable.

10I’ve seen a horrible thing in Israel:

Ephraim’s prostitution, Israel’s self-defilement.

11Judah, I’ve appointed a harvest time for you

when I restore my people’s fortunes.		Hos 6:4-11

7:1“When I would heal Israel,

Ephraim’s sin gets uncovered,

Samaria’s evil deeds as well,

because they’re devious.

Thieves go inside;

bandits raid outside.

2They don’t realize

that I remember their sinfulness.

Their deeds are all around them;

they’re right in front of me. 				Hos 7:1-2

3“They entertain the king with their sinfulness,

and the officials laugh at their lies.

4They’re adulterers,

like an oven heated by bakers

that keep the fire going

from the kneading of the dough till it’s risen.

5On our king’s holidays, the officials get sick with the heat of wine,

he joins in with the ones who mock him.

6Their hearts are like an oven

that burns with intrigue.

Their anger smolders all night

and breaks out in the morning like a blazing fire.

7They’re all hot like an oven

and consume their leaders.

They kill their kings;

yet none of them cries out to me for help.		Hos 7:3-7

8“Ephraim mixes in with foreigners;

he’s like a half-baked cake that doesn’t get turned over.

9Worshipping foreign gods is sapping his strength,

but he doesn’t even realize it.

Gray hairs are peppering his head,

but he doesn’t notice it.

10Though Israel’s pride testifies against him,

he doesn’t come back to Yahveh his God

or rely on him.

11“So Ephraim has become a silly pigeon

that coos to Egypt and flies to Assyria.

12As he goes, I’ll cast my net over him,

bring him down like a bird from the sky,

and punish him in proportion to his sinfulness. 		Hos 7:8-12

13“Misfortune awaits him

for straying from me!

Destruction is in store for him

for rebelling against me!

I would have redeemed him,

but he slandered me.

14He doesn’t call out to me sincerely,

but wails on his bed.

He gashes himself for grain and new wine,

turning away from me to foreign gods.

Although I trained him and made him strong,

he still plots against me.

16He turns, but not upward;

he’s like a crooked bow;

his officers will die by the sword

because of their insolence toward me.

Egypt will laugh at them.		Hos 7:13-16

Israel Will Reap the Whirlwind

8:1“Put the bugle to your lips!

A vulture is swooping down on Yahveh’s Temple

because my people have broken my covenant

and disobeyed my Law.

2Israel pleads with me,

‘We know you; you’re our God!’

3Israel has rejected what’s good;

so his enemies will chase him.

4He’s set up kings, but not by me;

he’s appointed officials, but I didn’t know it.

By making idols out of his silver and gold,

he’s gotten himself destroyed.

5“I’ve rejected your calf, Samaria, and said,

‘My anger burns against you!

How long will you not be capable of innocence?

6Even that calf originated from Israel!

A workman made it, so it’s not God;

Samaria’s calf will certainly be smashed.		 Hos 8:1-6

7“You’ve sown the wind;

you’ll reap the whirlwind.

Your standing grain has no heads;

it won’t yield any grain.

If it did, foreigners would eat it.

8Israel has been swallowed up;

among the nations

he’s like a pot nobody cares about.

9He’s gone up to Assyria

like a wild donkey all alone;

Ephraim has hired lovers.

10Even though he’s hired other nations as allies,

I’ll gather him up for judgment.

He won’t be appointing

his own kings and officials for a while. 		Hos 8:7-10

11“Ephraim has multiplied altars to remove sin,

but they’re altars for him to sin with.

12Though I wrote 10,000 laws for him,

he considers them something foreign.

13The people offer the meat of my sacrifices and eat it,

but Yahveh doesn’t delight in them.

He’ll remember their iniquity

and punish them for their sins.

They’ll go back to Egypt.

14Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;

Judah has multiplied fortified towns.

But I’ll set their towns afire

and burn their fortresses.” 		Hos 8:11-14

Hosea Announces Israel’s Punishment

9:1Israel, don’t celebrate like other nations;

you’ve carried on prostitution by leaving your God.

You’ve loved prostitutes’ earnings on every threshing floor.

2Threshing floor and winepress won’t feed you;

you won’t have any new wine.

3You won’t remain in Yahveh’s land;

you’ll return to Egypt

and eat unclean food in Assyria.

4You won’t be pouring out

liquid offerings of wine to Yahveh there;

your sacrifices won’t please him.

Your bread will be unclean like mourners’ bread;

everybody that eats it will be defiled

because it will only be for your hunger;

you can’t bring it to Yahveh’s Temple.

5What will you do on stated festival days,

Yahveh’s festival days?

6Even if you escape being destroyed by Assyria,

Egypt will round you up,

and Memphis will bury you.

Weeds will take over your silver troves;

thorns will invade your tents.		Hos 9:1-6

7The time for punishment has come;

the time for retribution is here.

Let Israel know that!

Because of how gross your sin is,

how great your hostility is, you say,

“Prophets are fools;

inspired men are crazy.”

8Prophets are watchmen for my God over Ephraim;

but bird catchers’ snares lie on all their paths;

there’s hatred for them in the temple of their God.

9The people have made themselves as depraved

as they were at Gibeah long ago.

He’ll remember their iniquity

and punish their sins.		Hos 9:7-9

10Yahveh says,

“At first, finding Israel was like finding grapes in the desert;

I saw their ancestors like the first fruit on a fig tree’s first season.

But they came to Baal-peor

and devoted themselves to their shameful idol;

they became as detestable as the idol they loved.

11Ephraim’s glory will soon fly off like a bird

because there’ll be no conception, no pregnancy, no birth!

12Even if they do raise children,

I’ll take them away till there aren’t any left.

Misfortune awaits them when I leave them!

13Ephraim is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre,

but he’ll bring out his children for slaughter.”

14Give them, Yahveh—what will I say to give them?

Give them miscarrying wombs and dry breasts. 		Hos 9:10-14

15Yahveh says, “Their sins began in Gilgal;

I started to despise them there!

Because of their sinful deeds,

I’ll drive them out of my house!

I won’t love them anymore;

their officials are rebels.

16The people of Ephraim are stricken,

their root has dried up,

they won’t bear any more children.

If they do,

I’ll kill their precious ones at birth.”

17My God will expel them

because they’ve ignored him.

So they’ll wander without progeny among the nations. 	Hos 9:15-17

10:1Israel is a luxurious vine

that grows his own fruit.

The more his fruit,

the more altars he makes;

the better his land,

the better the sacred pillars he sets up.

2He’s been unfaithful;

now he must pay for his guilt.

Yahveh is going to tear down his altars

and pull over his sacred pillars.		Hos 10:1-2

3Then they’ll say, “We don’t have a king

because we didn’t respect Yahveh;

even if we had one,

what could he do for us?”

4They just talk;

they make treaties they don’t intend to keep,

so condemnations sprout up like noxious weeds

in the ditches in their fields.

5The residents in Samaria will fear

for the calf idol at Beth-aven [Bethel].

Its people will mourn for it;

its idolatrous priests will cry

over its departed beauty.

6The idol itself they will carry off to Assyria

as tribute to their great king;

Ephraim will be disgraced for depending on it.

7Samaria and its king will float away

like driftwood on the ocean tide.

8The high places of Beth-aven, the place of Israel’s sin,

will fall into ruin;

thorns and thistles will grow up around their altars.

Then they’ll call to the mountains, “Cover us!”

and to the hills, “Fall on us!” 			Hos 10:3-8

9Yahveh says, “Ever since Gibeah,

they’ve just kept on sinning!

Wasn’t it right for war to break out against them?

10When I so desire,

I’ll attack those sinners;

I’ll gather the nations’ armies against them

to punish them for their extreme guilt.		Hos 10:9-10

11“Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to tread out grain,

and I used to spare her fair neck.

But I’ll put a yoke on Ephraim;

I’ll make Judah plow

and Jacob harrow by himself.

12Sow seeds of goodness;

harvest a crop of lasting love.

Break up your heart’s hardened, fallow ground;

it’s time to look to Yahveh

so he’ll come to shower goodness on you.

13“You’ve cultivated sinfulness and harvested injustice;

you’ve eaten the produce of lies

because you’ve trusted in going it on your own

with your big army.

14So the loud noise of war will arise among your people

and destroy your fortresses

the way Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in battle,

and mothers were dashed to pieces with their children.

15That’s what’s going to happen to you, too, Bethel,

because of your extreme sinfulness.

Israel’s king will be killed at dawn.		Hos 10:11-15

Yahveh’s Love for Israel

11:1“When Israel was young, I loved him

and called my son out of Egypt.

2The more I called him,

the more he withdrew from me.

He kept sacrificing to images of Baal

and burning incense to idols.

3But I was the One that taught Ephraim to walk,

leading him by the hand;

but he didn’t know I was the One that healed him.

4I led him with the leashes of mercy and bonds of love;

I became like One that eased the bridle from his jaws

and bent over to feed him.		Hos 11:1-4

5“My people won’t go back to Egypt;

Assyria will be their king

because they refused to come back to me.

6The sword will rage against their towns;

their enemies will break through their gate bars

and destroy them for their evil intentions.

7So my people are intent on turning away from me;

though the prophets call them to me,

none of them honors me.					Hos 11:5-7

8“How can I give up on you, Ephraim?

How can I let you go, Israel?

How can I make you like Admah

or treat you like Zeboiim?

My heart shrinks back within me;

my compassion wells up.

9I won’t act on my fierce anger

or destroy Ephraim again,

because I’m divine, not mortal,

the Holy One among you;

I won’t come in anger.

10They’ll follow me;

I’ll roar like a lion,

and my people will come cringing from the west.

11They’ll come fluttering like birds from Egypt,

like pigeons from Assyria;

I’ll settle them in their houses,” Yahveh declares.

12“Ephraim surrounds me with lies,

and the House of Israel with deceit.

Judah also rebels against me,

against the Holy One that’s faithful.”		Hos 11:8-12

12:1Ephraim feeds on wind,

and constantly chases after the east wind;

he piles up lies and violence;

he even makes an alliance with Assyria

while he’s carrying olive oil to Egypt to buy help.

Yahveh’s Indictment Against Israel and Judah

2Yahveh has a dispute with Judah too;

he’ll punish Jacob

in proportion to his “deceit.”

3In the womb he grabbed his brother’s heel;

when he grew up, he even wrestled with God.

4He wrestled with an angel and prevailed;

he cried and begged for his blessing.

He found him at Bethel

and spoke to him there—

5Yahveh God of Hosts,

Yahveh is his name. 		Hos 12:1-5

6So come back to your God,

observe kindness and justice;

depend on him always.

7But he’s become a shrewd businessman with false balances

who loves to oppress.

8Ephraim has said, “I got rich;

I made myself wealthy.

Nobody caught me being dishonest;

that would have made it illegal!”

9“I’ve been Yahveh your God since Egypt;

I’ll make you live in tents again

as at the Festival of Booths.

10I’ve spoken to the prophets

and given them lots of visions;

I’ve delivered parables through them.”			Hos 12:6-10

11But there’s sinfulness in Gilead,

worthless people.

They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal too;

their altars are like rock piles

along a plowed field.

12Jacob fled to the land of Aram

and kept sheep to get a wife.

13Then Yahveh brought his descendants

out of Egypt by a prophet

and protected them by him.

14But they’ve made Yahveh bitterly angry;

so he’s sentenced them to death

in payment for their disgrace.		Hos 12:11-14

Yahveh’s Anger at Israel

13:1When Ephraim spoke, people cringed;

he made himself important in Israel,

but because of Baal he became guilty and died.

2Now his people sin more and more

and make molten images,

idols skillfully formed from silver,

all made by craftsmen.

They say, “Sacrifice to them,

kiss the calf idols!”

3So they’ll be like morning mist,

like dew that dries off soon,

like chaff blown from a threshing floor,

like smoke from a chimney.		Hos 13:1-3

4“Yet I’ve been Yahveh your God since Egypt;

you weren’t to know any God but me

because there is no savior but me.

5I took care of you in the desert,

in a land of drought.

6But when you got to pasture,

fed to the full and satisfied,

you got independent and forgot about me.

7So I’ll be like a lion to you

and lie in wait by the road like a leopard.

8I’ll attack you like a bear robbed of her cubs

and tear your chests open.

I’ll devour you like a lioness

and maul you like a wild animal.		Hos 13:4-8

9“It’s to your destruction, Israel,

that you’re against me, your help.

10Where’s your king

that’s going to save you in all your towns?

Where are the officials you requested,

‘Give me a king and officials’?

11I gave you a king in my anger

and took him away in my wrath.

12“The iniquity of Ephraim has been collected

and stored up for retribution.

13The pains of childbirth have come on him;

he’s not a very smart son;

it’s too late to keep from being born. 			Hos 13:9-13

14“Should I ransom him from Sheol?

Should I redeem him from death?

No, I won’t show him mercy; so

Death, where are your thorns?

Death, where is your sting?

Bring it.

15Though he’s flourishing like a reed,

an east wind will come—

Yahveh’s wind from the desert—

and dry up his fountain;

his spring will go dry.

It will ‘blow away’ every precious article in his treasury.

16Samaria will bear the consequences of his guilt

because he rebelled against his God:

his residents will fall by the sword;

his little ones will be dashed to pieces;

his pregnant women will be ripped open.”		Hos 13:14-16

Healing for the Repentant

14:1Israel, come back to Yahveh your God;

you’ve stumbled because you sinned.

2Come back to Yahveh

and bring your confession with you.

Say, “Take away our sin;

receive us graciously

so we can offer our praises to you.

3Assyria can’t save us;

neither can our warhorses.

We won’t say ‘our god’ anymore

to something we’ve made;

only from you can we orphans receive mercy.” 		Hos 14:1-3

4Yahveh says,

“I’ll heal your apostasy

and love you freely

because my anger will be gone.

5I’ll be like dew to you;

you’ll blossom like a lily.

6Your roots will spread out like the cedars in Lebanon.

7Your people that live in your shade,

will raise grain again,

and blossom like grapevines.

You’ll be as fragrant as Lebanon’s wine.		Hos 14:4-7

8“Ephraim, I don’t have any connection with idols.

I directly am the One that answers your prayers

and takes care of you.

I’m like a green cypress;

your fruit all comes from me.”

9Whoever is wise, understand—

whoever perceives, be aware:

the Lord’s way is the right way;

good people follow it,

but sinners trip over it.		Hos 14:8-9
