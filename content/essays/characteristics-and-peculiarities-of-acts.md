CHARACTERISTICS AND PECULIARITIES OF ACTS

1.	Along with Luke, Acts has short paragraphs that summarize periods of time the author

does not handle in detail: 1:12-14; 2:43-47; 4:32-35; 6:7; 8:1-3, 25, 40; 12:24-25; 15:33-35, 41; 19:21-22; 28:30-31. They serve as links between the high points the author has highlighted.

2.	On some occasions the author introduces a brief note about someone that will play a major role later in the account: Saul at the stoning of Stephen (7:58; 8:1), Barnabas as among those who sold land to support for the needy (4:36-37), John Mark as the one whose mother owned the upper room where the disciples awaited Peter’s fate (12:12).

3.	In the mouth of Jesus, Luke states what could become the geographical outline of Acts (1:8): Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, the ends of the earth.

4.	The only New Testament document to refer to Christianity as “The Way”: 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22; cp. 18:25, 26 (note John 14:6; also Romans 5:2; Ephesians 2:18; Hebrews 10:20)*

5.	The only writing besides 1 Peter 4:16 to refer to followers of Jesus as “Christians” (11:26; 26:28)*. Note also the “of Christ” expression in 1 Corinthians 1:12; 3:23.

6.	Contains the only dominical saying outside the gospels (20:35; note also 1 Corinthians 11:24, 25-26)

7.  	Has all eleven usages of the expression “together” (ὁμοθύμαδον) except one (Romans 15:6): 1:14; 2:1, 46; 4:24; 5:12; 7:57; 8:6; 12:20; 15:25; 18:12; 19:29.*

8.	Except for Matthew 12:41, Luke-Acts has the double-noun “men _____ ”: Luke 7:37 (sinner woman?); 11:32; 17:12; 24:19; Acts 1:16; 2:22, 29, 37; 3:12, 14; 5:35; 7:2; 8:27; 11:20; 13:6, 15, 16, 26, 38; 15:7, 13; 16:9; 17:22; 21:28; 22:1; 23:1, 6; 28:17*

9.	Luke-Acts is the only two-volume work in the New Testament.

10.	Provides the only historical framework for tracing the activities in the first thirty-five years of the church. It supplies the historical framework for at least a majority of Paul’s epistles.

11. 	The only New Testament writing perhaps addressed to a government official (Theophilus; 1:1).

12.	Except for Ephesians 5:18, Luke-Acts alone uses the filling imagery for the Spirit.

13.	Frequently (79 times) uses “Jews” especially in chapters 9-28, dedicated more to non-Judaean territories. Only 2 appear in chapters 1-8: 2:5, 10). John’s gospel has 68.
