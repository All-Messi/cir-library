LAYOUT OF THOUGHTS ON DEUTERONOMY 6:4

יהוה אלהינו יהוה אהד

“Yahveh our God is one Yahveh.”

“Yahveh is our God, Yahveh alone.”

“Yahveh is our God, Yahveh is one.”

“Yahveh is our God; Yahveh is unique.”

A Jewish                                	   	  A  Jewish

Viewpoint      	Response      	 Response                   	Counter-response

Deuteronomy 6:4  “us”              	(a) majestic plural        	Genesis   3:22*   “one   of   us”

does not mean majestic plural;

it is the clearest Old Testament

text   on   plurality   associated

with trinitarian deity.

one = single        	Genesis 1:26;   	(b) angels + God = “us”   (1) Angels  not  yet   mentioned

being	    *3:22; 11:7				   in   Genesis.  Genesis   3:24

(Isaiah 6:8)                           			      refers  to   them  later  (note

Job  38:7 and 1:6 however).

(2) Besides, in the statement of

fulfillment       after       the

proposal  in  Genesis  1:26,

the  text  affirms that it is in

the image of God.

(3) It is in  his  image  (i.e.,  not

plural as one would expect

if “us” in 1:26 meant God +

angels).

Deuteronomy 6:4: (1)					The  “Shema”  needs  to contri-  								bute   to our  loving  God com- 			pletely.   That  he  is  a  single being  vs. a  trinity does  not  give  a reason for

loving him.  The point is rather  that one  means “unique,” or  “only one”  (no

other  gods); both  ideas  can  contribute  to reasons for loving him.

(2)  אֶהָד  (“one”) does not  eliminate  distinction  between  the  sub-units

of what is “one.” A good example is Genesis 2:24, where husband +

wife = אֶהָד (“one”) flesh.

Note: The preferred translation of Deuteronomy 6:4 is “Yahveh is our God, Yahveh  alone.”
