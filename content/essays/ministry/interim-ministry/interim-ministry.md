<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Earlier this week _______, who
takes care of speaker arrangements here at _________, forwarded to me your
letter requesting information on interim ministry. Since coming to the faculty
in 1977, I have been involved in interim ministries in Kansas, Nebraska, and
Missouri almost constantly for sixteen years. Earlier while teaching at The
Cincinnati Bible Seminary (1971-1974), I did this kind of work in several
churches in Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky. On the accompanying pages I have noted
some values that I have seen come to the <b>congregation</b> from those kinds
of experiences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        Most of the time the efforts
have lasted about six months--though some have been shorter. The normal time
has been between six months and a year. Five or six months is the normal
minimum for locating, choosing, and moving a new worker to the field. In one
instance the work lasted about a year and three months; in another case it
ended up being two years and nine months. Needless to say in the last case, my
involvement started taking on the character of a permanent part-time ministry,
a result that neither the congregation nor I originally intended; they simply
could not locate anyone for their relatively new work that had too limited a
budget for supporting a full-time arrangement, and a bi-vocational minister
could not be found. The church eventually moved to a permanent, part-time
arrangement. Actually it is reassuring to a church just to know that six to
twelve months is a normal time period for finding a minister; otherwise the
people may think that their progress is slow, that they are having a harder
time than other churches have, and therefore that something is wrong with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        As called on and as needed, I
have tried to help in recommending how best to go about searching for a new
man. Unlike other public businesses, most churches do not &quot;hire&quot;
someone for this job frequently enough to develop wise procedures or the
distinctive required. I have suggested sources of information and certain
procedures that are more liable to produce desirable results, raised cautions
about unnatural mixes between potential ministers and this church’s setting,
reminded them to ask certain questions they might not think of, and so on. Because
of my general awareness of the brotherhood in this area, I believe I have
helped churches avoid some bad experiences by suggesting contacts that should
be made beyond the references given in some letters of application. Being
available to assist as called on gives the local leadership added confidence in
fulfilling their responsibility in this crucial matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        In some cases, out of natural
appreciation for what I did “on the side” for them, churches have begun
financially supporting <b>the college where I teach</b>—though I have never
raised that point with any of them. They ask for suggestions about missionary
efforts and voluntarily contribute to projects like buying Russian Bibles,
which they come to know about because I happen to mention the need. Being
around someone from the “brotherhood&quot; at large tends to widen people’s
horizons and therefore their breadth of kingdom interest. That is a healthy
thing for a congregation. It turns the people outward and encourages them to do
something because more progress is being made in the kingdom at large than the
limited progress they can see in their immediate circumstance. In effect, then,
I have been able to sow some good will, not only among congregational members
themselves, but between the congregation and outside agencies, including this
school. They see the school as providing <u>them</u> with a needed service
instead of picturing it and other parachurch agencies as coming to them only to
<u>get</u> something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        There are some values to <b>the
interim minister himself</b> that are also not indicated on the other pages. I
gain a great deal of satisfaction from helping churches buy some time in order
to find good men. In several cases the preacher they hired has stayed ten or
fifteen years. In Ohio one minister remained twenty years. I would like to
think that my involvement helped create a positive atmosphere that enhanced the
likelihood of a longer subsequent ministry, not only because the congregation
obtained a better <u>minister</u>, but because they were a better <u>church</u>.
Keeping the spirit up--or getting the spirit back up--contributed toward his
inclination to stay with that more positive situation. That is a fulfilling
thing to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        There have been some financial
considerations as well, although I hope that has not been a prime motive for
doing interim ministries. For one thing, the added resources have supplemented
the sometimes unstable financial support that Bible colleges can give teachers.
Aside from that, I have used those funds for buying book, for underwriting at
least partially some short-term missions efforts, for financing writing
projects and travel expenses I incur in other forms of ministry, and for
contributing more to other people’s needs in their ministries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                         In my situation I cannot hold
down a full-time preaching ministry and at the same time teach in Bible
College. Being able to involve myself this way in preaching and other forms of
local work gives me an outlet for some things I would not otherwise have much
opportunity to do. It increases my skills in public presentation and other
local-ministry responsibilities. Interim ministry also improves my work in
preparing other people for ministry because it keeps clearly before my eyes
what the &quot;real ministry&quot; faces. As a consequence my instruction in
Bible content courses, Greek, Hebrew, theology, and ministry classes is more
easily connected with local ministry. It has brought into focus what I have
come to call &quot;education for use,&quot; education and learning that is
always thought of in connection with application to the life and witness of
Christian people. There is a world of difference between a &quot;church
theologian&quot; and a &quot;professional theologian&quot; because of this
precise point. The church theologian intentionally teaches in a way that
connects information with application.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        In effect these interim
ministries should help <b>my students</b> as well because class members should
be learning in a way that connects information with application. Hopefully they
do not see me simply as an academician. Recent illustrations from church
settings enliven the doctrinal and exegetical material I teach. Students should
sense that what they and I are doing in the classroom is relevant to the
&quot;real&quot; ministry and that their education is not an academic rite of
passage they must complete before a church will hire them.</span></p>

serve the purpose you had in mind when you wrote. I remain</span></p>
