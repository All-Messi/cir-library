<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Introduction</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Her
name is not given, but she was twelve. The father, a ruler of the synagogue,
did what desperate fathers do: he went to find the only help he knew, because
she was ill and very weak. At the earnest urging of Jairus, our Lord turned
that day from present labors and walked beside a worried man toward the object
of his care. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            But
before they reached that destination, a messenger from the house stopped them
in the road: <i>“Trouble not the Master; she has passed away.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:31.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></i><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>:49: <u>Once that has happened, nothing can be done</u>.
<i>“Trouble not the master; she has passed away.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-4.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
40.5pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A miracle worker, was he? Yes, a healer
of the most noteworthy sort, one who healed even the lepers, the palsied, and
the lame. But does not the implication of the man’s plaintive words ring true
that “where there is <u>life</u> there is hope”? And now hope was gone; for, as
he said, “She has passed away.” Hope is a wonderful power in the midst of
trial; but there are bounds to hope, bounds set by what we have already seen. BUT
we have not seen everything yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:-40.5pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>II.  <b>8</b>:50: <i>“Fear not,”</i> he answered;
“just trust me: she will be made whole.” <u>By what we <i>have</i> seen, we
dare to trust for more than the present scene</u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Is
it too much for him, who created the heavens and the earth and made us all—is
it sensible to limit God and suggest, “Don’t worry about it now; there is
nothing more to be done”?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>They walk on—the messenger and the man, more than
worried now, crushed by loss, and even more—confused by hope. They near the
home, pass through the gate, enter the door—to meet the mourners there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:-.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>III. <b>8</b>:52: “She is not dead; she’s asleep.” Jesus
called it “sleep,” though they and he [53] knew she had passed away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jesus called it sleep because that is closer to the
truth of what it is than what the mourners, family, friends, neighbors, and
father and mother were thinking and feeling</span></u><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>. They sensed finality; he saw temporary repose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:-.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>8</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>:53: <i>“They
laughed at him,”</i> it says. The professional mourners ridiculed one so naïve,
they thought, as not to recognize the obvious state of the girl who lay before
them all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>For their unbelief he put them out, and with her
parents and his disciples he approached the bedside of the daughter. There he
did what was more than they had dared to hope for, more even than had entered
into their heart: he went beyond the cure of sickness to the conquest of its
worst consequence—just as the Father went beyond taking Jesus down from the
cross, and raised him from the grave. The temporary sorrows with its fears were
not removed; those lesser things enhanced the greater victory—o’er the grave.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(<b>8</b>:54): <i>“Talitha, Cumi</i>
[Maiden, get up].” What happened with the daughter of Jairus will happen with
each of us who will indeed follow in her train. The difference lies only in <u>the
amount of time</u> between the passing and the rising. The certainty of both is
the same, and what happens will be for all practical purposes the same as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>It remains for us to carry on the struggle of life. True
to our mortal condition, we have confidence in front of the enemies we see, and
with at least minor confidence we wage the warfare of the world. BUT there is
more to our struggle than arms and weapons can address; there are the
intangible enemies, the invisible foes. We must carry on.</span></p>
