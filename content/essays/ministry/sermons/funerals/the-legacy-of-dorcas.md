<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What
We Learn from Experience</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            When
Peter came to Joppa that day, they began showing him the garments and coats
Dorcas had made. I venture to say, they did not do that because the garments
were <u>nicely made</u>, although no doubt they were. I venture to say, they
did not do that because she was a <u>good seamstress</u>, although she probably
was. I venture to say, they did not do that because the garments were <u>expensive</u>,
although she may have used the best material she could find.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            What
they showed Peter that day was the “added value,” the personal touch. They
showed him that day, not garments particularly, but meaning and love. The same
garment bought at a department store has not a chance of carrying with it the
value of a dress made by loving hands and given to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            What
we see about garments in the legacy of Dorcas we see in the legacy of each
person who passes through our experience and shares </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The
stark experiences of life have a way of ordering the endless details of human
existence, the seemingly endless muddle of apparently chaotic particulars that
fill up disordered lives. But the stark experiences of life—by the very loss
that we invariably sense attendant to them—force us to note what is important
here. Priorities and patterns emerge from the seemingly cluttered page much
like what happens when you put back the removed tabs on a page full of
numerical data. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Today we <u>know</u> what is important because the
loss of a part of it reminds us of how important is the presence of the
personal touch, the “added value,” that another’s life makes. It is the
difference between a $50 dress and a priceless gift. Today we cannot help <u>resolving</u>—and
should not help resolving—to live henceforth in light of what impresses itself
on us irresistibly the morning. This much we can know from down-to-earth
experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What
We Know</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We
know now that it is not so much what we <u>do</u> as <u>who</u> we do it for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>           
                        . . .           how hard we <u>work</u> as <u>who</u>
we work hard for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    .
. .           what we <u>have</u> as <u>who</u> we have it for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                    .
. .           what we earn as <u>who</u> we earn it for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The
work eventually comes to nothing. The earnings from the work eventually come to
nothing. The possessions bought with the earnings eventually come to nothing. The
physical will come to nothing. But the “added value” remains in the fond
memories and the enriched lives. The <u>what</u> always passes away, but the <u>who</u>
remains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Experience
is a great teacher, and it teaches us that “persons for others” are what is
important. But experience can teach us only what it knows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What
We Cannot Know</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We
are a small part of a vast thing we call reality. What the rest of it is <u>like</u>
we can only imagine. We cannot know from experience how <u>much</u> of it there
really is. <i>“We walk by faith and not by sight”</i> (2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:7);
that is, we conduct life by trust more than by personal experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The
rest of reality and the rest of endless time we must know by TRUST/FAITH. And
that is not surprising. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What happened on the Plains of Marathon
we cannot see; and so, to know it, we must trust testimony (PAST). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is happening in Trafalgar Square,
London, at the moment we cannot know. What is happening in Nagano (the winter
Olympic games) we cannot know; and so, to know it, we must trust testimony
(PRESENT). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What will happen tomorrow we cannot know
by sight; and so, to know it, we must trust the One who is in charge of it
(FUTURE).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Only a fraction of what we know about our own subset
do we know by sight: 2 Corinthians <b>5</b>:7.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                                                   
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The value of the incarnation is to tell us that this
is but the first inning; this is but the twilight of the first day. He who came
from beyond us informs us of a reason to hope. He adds the word <u>tomorrow</u>
to our felt vocabulary. And confirms it with his own resurrection, by which he
materializes his <u>words</u> with an <u>act</u> of confirmation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>His whole coming was for us like a garment is made and
given by loving hands to materialize for us the invisible bonds of personal
love.</span></p>
