Do You Have That You Didn’t Receive?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Lord,
today we consider our place in the larger scheme of things, and so acknowledge
you, first of all, as the beginning of all else besides you, the sustainer of
all you have made, and the basis for the hope that stretches out before us. Amen</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
is the question: What do you have that you didn’t receive? Obviously, you have
labored long and hard in the process of life. Yet what you have contributed
could not have been done without the possibilities and opportunities already in
place and the abilities passed down to you. In the countryside around, lie
fields where you and your neighbors work the ground, plant the seed, harvest
the crops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
you did not develop that seed or design and build those implements, or
transport the fuel and fertilizer to your land or its produce to some final
destination. Zooming in more closely, you can appreciate the research that went
into developing the fuel for your combines and the technology it took to
discover and assemble the materials for manufacturing the metal and rubber in
your equipment. Perhaps better than most people, farmers can appreciate how
dependent we all are on factors beyond our control and on processes we did not
originate—and may not even understand. Were it not for rain and sun, there
would be no fruits of our labors, however much we labored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
we come to this day in this place and to the recognition of those who have
provided the circumstances available to us. The grave markers erected all
around amount to monuments of remembrance. The flowers planted here are tokens
of gratitude. The cemetery itself is a sanctuary of respect, well-kept and
beautified to indicate our attitude toward those laid to rest here. The time
set aside allows us to step aside from daily demands so we can more
reflectively think about our place in the big picture. That frees us to recognize
that the vast proportion of what we have was received from those who expended
themselves for us, some to that “last measure of devotion.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Though
we contribute to specific results we enjoy, that contribution is less than at
first we might suppose. So our response to the situation is that of
humility—not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think,
gratitude—not to forget we are debtors, every one, and to resolve that we will
not be a weak link in the chain of remembrance. We pay our heritage forward and
provide in our legacy the difference between what we have received and what we
have to give. Ours is the rest of the story. We must tell it well.</span></p>
