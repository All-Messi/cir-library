<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
saying goes, “The future of an event belongs to the event.” Let me explain. When
something happens, it does not just happen <u>disconnected from</u> what is
around it. Out of it flows what it <u>leads to</u>. That fact opens up a way to
measure the importance of the occurrence. How <u>long</u> do its effects last? How
<u>many</u> people does it impact? How much capacity does it have for its
consequences to <u>grow</u> as time goes on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Now
quickly to the point. The importance and meaning of what happens is determined by
what becomes of it. In the War of Independence, the Great War, World War II,
and so on, the importance and meaning of those victories becomes greater as we carry
forward the purpose and values those conflicts established. Something that
changes history for two thousand years is more important than one that affects
things for twenty. Those who “follow in their train” make it what it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            An
illustration from my own experiences shows what we mean here. Earlier this
spring, I visited the old family farm in southeastern Indiana. That is where I
lived all through my school years. The house I slept in is falling down. The
kitchen where my folks and I ate supper has caved in. Sheathing boards have
rotted out and fallen through the rafters. Old asphalt shingles hang draped
over the remaining rafters. You dare not walk on the floors; you risk falling
through into the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Up
the road a mile is Elmer Kaiser’s farm. I worked for him quite a bit growing
up. His house was probably built about the same time as ours. The owners have
kept a good roof on it. They have maintained the white paint and blue trim over
the years. People continue to live there as they have for some hundred and
fifty years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
men that built the two houses were equally skilled, equally dedicated to their
work, equally hard-working as they dug out the cellars, laid up the rock
foundations, erected the frames and decking, nailed on the clapboard siding and
wood-shingle roofs, and finished the plaster-lath walls inside. The difference
is the maintenance. Building Elmer’s house has become a greater event than
building ours. Building his house increases in importance as people keep living
in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            That
pattern applies to the “honored dead” who lie here and to what they took part
in before this day. Oddly, it may seem, the importance of our parents and
ancestors does not lie so much with them, what they accomplished and stood for,
as it lies with us. It is for us to make increasingly important each victory of
the past. Of course, it is for us to have <u>gratitude</u> for the achievements
of bygone days. But more importantly it is for us to muster <u>resolve</u> to
maintain and grow what they have handed down to us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            “The
future of a victory belongs to that victory.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is for us to have <u>gratitude</u> for the achievements of bygone days. But
more importantly, it is for us to muster <u>resolve</u> to maintain and grow
what has been handed to us.</span></p>
