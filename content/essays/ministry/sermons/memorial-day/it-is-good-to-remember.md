<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            </span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the grand cycle of life, only four or five
generations of humanity are accessible to our experience at any one moment in
history. Those earlier men and women we must remember, and so we set aside this
day to reflect on their contribution to our welfare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            It
is important to remember because doing so fosters <u>appreciation</u>. None of
us are self-made people. Those who went before set the range of possibilities
that we choose among and now enjoy. Were it not for their sacrifices and
labors, we would not have the freedoms we prize or many of the possessions we
own. Surely we shape our own lives and mold their direction by our efforts, but
those efforts are largely exerted within the options that have been handed down
to us. We owe our ancestors a great debt of gratitude, and we inherit an
obligation in turn to leave our legacy—to respect, cherish, and protect the
privileges inherited our forefathers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this same vein, we remember in order to appreciate
the gifts of our creator. He has been our primary benefactor in setting up life
itself with its good things. It is within these options that we labor and gain
satisfaction from labor, within which we relate to family, friends, and
fellowman and receive pleasure in so doing. We have not made ourselves, nor
have we made many of the possibilities that we by effort shape to our
particular interests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is important to remember in order to have proper <u>humility</u>.
When we stop to appreciate the boundless happiness that has come to us from
those before us and from no effort of our own, we are not inclined to boast in
our fair estate. We take proper pride in our condition and duly understand that
it is ours by grant more than by merit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is important to remember so we may have a sense of <u>responsibility</u>.
As the legacy of the past passes to us unearned, so also in the cycle of life
we have our turn to pass on undiminished the freedoms, rights, and duties we
first received. We would not prove to be lesser guardians of the good, the
true, and the beautiful than those who toiled and even died in making sure
their offspring could lead peaceful and fruitful lives. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>That means we must be strong in the moments of
decision that bear on our destiny and that of our children. In those moments of
choice is set the subsequent course of human existence and world affairs.</span></p>

decide,</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the strife of truth with falsehood, For the good or
evil side;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Some great cause, some great decision, Off'ring each

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>And the choice goes by forever 'Twixt that darkness
and that light.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span

wretched crust,</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Though the cause of evil prosper, Yet the truth alone
is strong;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span

throne be wrong,</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>                        “Once to Every Man and Nation”
by James Russel Lowell</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            National
conflict and political unrest have taken their toll on the lives of many
honored dead we remember today, but those evils manifest more basic and more
eternal evils that erupt in strife between nations, classes, and individuals. The
spiritual wickedness that separates people from their God separates them also
from each other; it devastates people and destroys the quality of life and its
meaningfulness for all humankind. For this reason, with these memorable words
the apostle Paul urged responsibility on his readers many years ago:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power. Put on
the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s
schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the
rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and
against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore, put on
the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to
stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then,
with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of
righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes
from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith,
with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the
helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.”</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> (Ephesians<b> 6</b>:10-17, <b>NIV</b>)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The spiritual aspect of life sets the character of our
material existence in the world. We do well to remember today the universal and
eternal importance of this factor because from it issues all that we value and
hold dear. And therein rests most of all our appreciation, our humility, our
responsibility.</span></p>
