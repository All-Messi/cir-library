<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>People have different
reasons for getting an education. (a) <u>Education for knowledge</u> is a
German emphasis. The goal is accuracy and completeness in any field of study.
If anything develops out of that knowledge, well and good; but the stress falls
on knowledge for its own sake and the love for learning as such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What has been a British
emphasis is (b) <u>education for culture</u>. The goal consists of fulfilling expectancies
associated with a person’s position in the social structure. Cultured people
should know their way around in the world, be able to converse intelligently
about what goes on there, and be able to place themselves and their society in
the proper historical niche. The upper classes serve as tradition bearers who
give stability to the present social structure. As a primary function,
education reinforces social position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The American
distinctive has a stronger element of (c) <u>education for use</u>. This
pragmatic emphasis considers knowing information as it pertains to a person’s
vocation or impacts the “quality of life.” It does not mean that everything
must be directly usable to be valuable; it means that knowledge is always
thought of in connection with practical ends.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Relative to these three
standard categories, a Christian liberal arts education is closest to education
for use. Its goal is not knowledge for its own sake, nor does it concern itself
ultimately with human social agendas, particularly if they reinforce social barriers
rather than remove them. Connecting knowledge with use is overridden, however,
by connecting knowledge with the Source of what can be studied and his purposes
for bringing it into being. Christian education brings in what may be called
(d) <u>education for appreciation</u>. It is a God-centered approach that turns
education into theology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A Christian liberal
arts education deliberately brings each discipline under the qualifying effects
of God’s reality and purpose. It assumes a unified “field of knowledge” that
leads to integration between disciplines and calls for an interpersonal “centeredness”
rather than an impersonal disorientedness. Likewise, it leads to freedom, not
by disconnecting people from the rest of what is, but by properly connecting them
with it; education prepares them to move freely in conformity to reality. A
Christian liberal arts education looks at the disciplines, not in detached and
disinterested fashion, but as occasions for involvement with the One who made
them possible. That is certainly useful, but more than that it enhances
appreciation for the world and its Creator.</span></p>
