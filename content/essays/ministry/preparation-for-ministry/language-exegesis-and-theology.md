Biblical languages, texts, and topics naturally combine for study that undergirds personal growth and Christian ministry. Acquaintance with the original languages of scripture raises options not suggested by the English, eliminates possibilities English wording might allow, and gives access to additional study tools. Furthermore, a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew facilitates the evaluation of points made by other commentators on the biblical text, a great advantage to ministers, because we are constantly called upon to deal with doctrinal issues purportedly based on “the original.”

Exegetical study follows the layout of given books. It follows the author’s thought as he moves through various topics that bear on the practical needs of his readers. Doctrinal study approaches scripture topically. It assembles all materials on given subjects so a person can comprehend them as a unit and the Christian system as a whole.

Proper understanding of Christian truth establishes the foundation for outreach, edification, and protection. Zeal must arise from content in order for conversion to occur in those addressed by the gospel. Methods of evangelism and education must fit the message once for all time delivered to the saints. The more we understand the gospel, the more effectively we can serve in ministry roles that extend the church, build it up, and preserve it against threats from the outside and from within. We must know what in order to know how.
