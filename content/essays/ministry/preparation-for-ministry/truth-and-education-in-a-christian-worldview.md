<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            At the trial of Jesus,
Pilate remarked, <i>“What is truth?”</i> Jesus had just explained that he came
into the world to <i>“bear witness to the truth.”</i> Interestingly, the truth
issue does occupy the central reason for the personal incarnation of God into the
world of human persons. It establishes the agenda for the followers of Christ,
for “education that is Christian,” and for ministry preparation through an
education process. As goes the view of truth, so goes the nature of education
and the process of preparing for that education of the world that is called
evangelism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There are two views of truth:
what works and what is. The first is the pragmatic view; the second is the
correspondence view. Although the two concepts are related, Christians believe
that, in speaking about the truth, what we say must correspond to what is. That
contrasts with what is “truth for me” (the “existential” view of “truth”). As
far as the truth itself is concerned, Christianity further emphasizes the need
to see “what is” as ultimately personal—not god, but God. “God” refers to where
everything else originates, where everything else eventually leads to, what
everything else depends on, what controls the rest, what gives unity to the
whole. In the Christian faith, all these ways of looking at ultimate reality
are in a personal context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The whole creation needs to
be understood in relation to personal matters, not because creation is itself
personal, but because it came from person, is sustained by person, and is
directed by person.  The faith does not personify the universe; it personalizes
it. Heavenly bodies are not gods, for example, nor do they represent gods; but
the stars do declare the glory of a personal God because a personal God created
them.  Nature is not an aspect of God or an emanation from him, but the cosmos
did originate from him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Genesis <b>1</b>
personalizes the heavens and the earth by noting that God created them and that
the Spirit of God was moving on the face of the water (<b>1</b>:2). Personal
presence was there. Moreover, <i>“God said, ‘Let there be . . .’”</i> (<b>1</b>:3,
<i>etc</i>.). God spoke the world into existence; it came from an act of
choice. Communication and volition are personal characteristics. The heavens
and the earth that now exist are held together by a person (Colossians <b>1</b>:15-17).
Consequently, <u>he</u> was before <u>it</u>; God was before creation; he
sustains creation. Personhood precedes, creates, sustains, and gives purpose to
the universe.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Creation, then, is never to
be mentally abstracted from its personal Creator. It cannot be fully
appreciated for what it is by being viewed as something in itself—discretely,
by being regarded as an ultimate frame of reference, or by being subsumed under
science.  Otherwise, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>there
is</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> loss of meaning, erosion of the
religious, destruction of truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Something <i>“lives in every
hue Christless eyes have never seen”</i>: the personal touch. Personalizing the
heavens makes them like a hand-knit sweater from someone you love in contrast
to something made by a machine and bought at a store. Christianity has
personalism/interpersonalism as its worldview.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            All truth must be regarded
as God’s truth. It must comprise a unified field of knowledge; otherwise,
people are <i>“always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the
truth”</i> that means anything.  </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We arrive at</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> no
satisfying knowledge without him who is the truth, the way, and the light.  If
we know the Truth, he makes us free. Knowledge is active; truth is personal;
freedom is relational. Actively knowing him as a person allows us to move
freely by putting us in proper relationship with all reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Every perversion of truth
has involved some kind of shift away from ultimate reality as personal. Among
other things, Romans <b>1</b> indicts mankind for reducing the character of God
to something less than personal. Modern materialistic evolution provides one
more example of the ongoing cycle of revelation followed by perversion. Likewise,
every perversion of Christianity over the last twenty centuries has been some
kind of departure from its personal center.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The implications of these
things for formal ministerial education seem obvious. We cannot teach
everything, but we can promote the personalized worldview within which all
further learning must occur.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            More specifically, we
attempt to equip people with a conscious awareness of the central truth about
truth: grace and truth have come through Christ. A personalized understanding
of truth has implications for presenting truth: <i>“speaking the truth in love,”</i>
because love summarizes the positive manner of relationship between persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We must center educational
philosophy and practice on the personal character of truth and the interpersonal
manner of presenting truth.</span></p>
