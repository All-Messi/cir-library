line-height:18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Graduating someone with a
ministry degree does not necessarily increase the number of personnel in
permanent ministry. Several factors contribute to significant attrition,
especially during the early years of ministry. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Sometimes opportunities come
for pursuing other interests that are more financially rewarding. More often,
however, leaving the ministry stems from disillusionment, lack of fulfillment,
inability to get people to respond to one’s leadership, frustration, little
sense of progress. Adjusting the manner of preparation will not eliminate the
problem, but adjustments in the way we conceive of ministry preparation will
preserve for service a greater number of ministerial graduates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            We propose to consciously
view the 18-30 years as ministry preparation time. The situation is not one in
which four years of college prepares people for ministry and after that they do
ministry. Such a conception would be improper on two counts; the ministry
mentality and practice must precede graduation. The idea here is hardly new;
most people probably agree with it. However, the concept needs to be adopted
intentionally and deliberately as the regular expectancy both of churches and
young people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Lengthening the time allows
a person to phase into leadership ministry. The normal inadequacies of the
early years become parts of growing rather than instances of failure. The “system”
must operate in a way that “failures” can occur without destroying. Otherwise,
people overreact when ministers do fail. As a result, young ministers get
destroyed and church members get disillusioned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Lengthening the time phases
people into ministry because it allows for graduate study, internships,
residencies, and associate ministries. In recent years the number of summer and
yearlong internships has increased noticeably. More churches have seen the
value of taking part in the training of servants and have made the necessary
organizational and financial arrangements to do it. Such programs are healthy
because they let young ministers regard themselves that way. Many “mistakes”
can be avoided because there is someone to talk to and give counsel. Mistakes
that do happen are more easily kept in perspective, because mistakes happen
when people are learning. Other responsible ministers are present to provide
stability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Not only is the time
lengthened, but the lengthened time covers an important period of great change.
It gets a person past spouse selection. It allows family to get started as
well. The couple has experienced some setbacks and has learned how to relate to
each other “through thick and thin.” In keeping with that, other people have
begun to regard them as peers instead of kids. They know from their own
experience what it means to be married, what stresses come with raising
children, what economic pressures are there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Regardless of how much
American culture prizes its youth, it respects maturity and does not fully
grant that respect until people reach late twenties or early thirties. Consequently,
it is not realistic for a 22-year-old to expect to lead an intergenerational
group. They and the minister sense something unnatural about the situation. Given
cases may work, but it goes against the grain and leaves a bad taste for what
the ministry is like. The problem may very well have nothing to do with
ministry; it may be a procedural problem that lies in the system of ministry
preparation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Stretching out the time lets
people phase into ministry and into leadership; it also lets people finish
developing into adults. They can learn to enjoy work as well as play, to operate
from internal motivation instead of external compulsion, appreciate the
importance of group process rather than operate as “mavericks.” A longer
preparation time helps remove the youthful idealism that fosters criticism and
an all-or-nothing mentality. It also gives an opportunity to practice the
skills that cannot easily be taught in formal education.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>            We want people
to enjoy ministry in the long term. By deliberately setting a twelve-year
expectancy, we help them settle into a natural progress toward leadership
ministry. We believe they and the churches benefit in the long run.</span></p>
