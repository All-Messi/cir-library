<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            People have different
reasons for pursuing an education. (a) <u>Education for knowledge</u> has been
considered a German emphasis. The goal consists of accuracy and completeness in
any field of study. If anything develops out of that knowledge, well and good;
but the stress falls on knowledge for its own sake and the love for learning as
such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            What has been regarded as a
British emphasis is (b) <u>education for culture</u>. The goal here consists of
fulfilling expectancies associated with one’s position in the social structure.
Cultured people should know their way around in the world, be able to converse
intelligently about what goes on there, and be able to place themselves and their
society in the proper historical niche. The upper classes serve as tradition
bearers who contribute to the stability of the present social structure. As a
primary function, education reinforces social position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The American distinctive has
a stronger element of (c) <u>education for use</u>. The goal in this pragmatic
emphasis is to know information as it pertains to a person’s work or “quality
of life.” It does not mean that everything must be directly usable to be
valuable; rather, it means that knowledge always connects with practical ends.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Theological education
certainly falls under education for use. Theology strives to see a unified whole.
It deals with Christian truth topically more than exegetically. Theology wants
to see the truth itself instead of being content to follow a line of thought in
a book of the Bible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Out of regard for wholeness,
expressions are used that connect certain areas of concern with the ultimate
frame of reference—God. The “theology of leisure,” for example, connects the
use of leisure time with the ultimate concerns of God. The same can be said
about a theology of wealth, a theology of leadership, a theology of education.
Similarly, seminaries offer courses in “practical theology,” which studies how
the knowledge of God can most effectively affect the behavior and relationships
of people. The word <i>theology</i> is used for the study of <u>God himself</u>;
then theology refers to <u>topics studied</u> in relationship to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Within the framework of
education for use, people participate in at least two levels. (1) <u>Recognition</u>
follows along the presentation without much intention to log the information. Hearers
are rather passively involved as observers. There is little deliberate effort
to retain, so hearers remember what “strikes” them. This level of learning
occurs mostly in listening to sermons and in personal conversations. Nothing is
written down for later retrieval even though people realize they will retain only
a small percent. They suppose that what is important will “stick.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There are values, actually,
to such “light” learning. For one thing, it can <u>motivate</u>. Normally
people already know what they should do. They need continued encouragement to
do it. Light learning can <u>confirm</u>. People do not try to remember a whole
line of thought; they are satisfied with remembering the conclusion. If they
knew and believed it before, they feel more confident about it now because of
evidence that made sense as they listened, because someone they respect
defended the belief, or because it fits with their other convictions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Many activists take a recognition
approach to education. In the course of a presentation, they notice practical
pieces of information immediately useful to Christian life and service. They
find it difficult to take interest in the theory behind the practice, but they
make a little go a long way by using repeatedly what they do know. If some need
for explanation comes along, they do their best to create an explanation or
they ask someone about it, get the answer, and get on with their work again. They
learn what they recognize as immediately useful. Education for them is more
like grazing than mowing. They take a bit here and there to feed themselves for
doing something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A “theological education”
has more in mind, however, than these useful things. Its aim is (2) <u>generation</u>.
It enables people to “describe” to other people what they themselves know. In
light of his imminent martyrdom, Paul described the ongoing education process
for the church by telling Timothy, <i>“What you have heard from me . . . commit
to faithful people who can in turn teach others”</i> (2 Timothy <b>2</b>:2). First,
<u>Paul’s statement defines the theological student</u> as a “faithful” people,
those who demonstrates proper character as well as those who can be entrusted
with responsibility to serve. Besides that, they must be “able to teach,” which
implies a level of awareness and a facility for presentation. To carry on the
multiplication process, theology students must be equipped to generate the
content of Christian understanding, not just recognize it when they see it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Second, <u>Paul’s statement
defines the theological enterprise</u>. To teach, people must (a) <u>know
theory</u> as well as have skills; otherwise, they will not know how to
generalize beyond the specifics that scripture mentions. Too many new moral
issues and contemporary concepts simply must be evaluated and decided on to
leave biblical study at the level of direct assertion. “Theological
interpretation” requires faithful people to extract principles from particulars
so they can generalize to contemporary dilemmas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            “Biblical positivism,” on
the other hand, contents itself with affirming the statements of scripture
without venturing to explain their meaning. While such a practice seems safe,
it accomplishes little because it repeats words without conveying meaning. Knowing
theory gets at the “meaning” of things—the connection between parts, between
parts and whole, between causes and consequence—and enab­les us to generalize
to current needs that revelation does not address.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            To teach faithful people, people
must be able to (b) <u>see the big picture</u> as well as understand its parts.
Having an overall grasp of Christian truth makes it possible to see
relationships between parts, judge the relative importance of each one, and
determine whether matters are germane to Christian concerns. Continually trying
to work at the detailed level causes Christians to stress secondary things and
to center their interests in the wrong places, because they cannot get a good
sense of proportion. In fact, a general perspective is often necessary before
some individual matters come into proper focus. These cases illustrate the
give-and-take that occurs between exegesis that leads to overview and overview
that elucidates other exegetical particulars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A capable teacher needs to
(c) <u>organize for presentation as well as understand subject matter</u>. Even
as many people can do but do not understand well, so others understand but
cannot teach well. A faithful person who can teach others must structure presentation
to achieve clarity. A good pianist may not be a good piano teacher. Even as
learning requires a deliberate act beyond hearing, so teaching requires
structuring beyond knowing. There are no shortcuts to learning for teaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A theological education
necessarily includes (d) the <u>more advanced matters of the faith</u> along
with the preliminaries (Hebrews <b>5</b>:11-<b>6</b>:13). We must understand
these matters, not only as a safeguard against temptation through persecution, but
also as a basis for articulating them to others in trying times (1 Timothy <b>4</b>:16).
Such understanding needs to be “part of us” because we minister out of what we
consciously know. We should not expect to field hard questions by sheer
creativity on the “spur of the moment” or suppose that we can learn what we
need to know “on the wing.” Preparation ahead of time lets us concentrate on
issues aside from the “heat of the moment” and the pressure of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A theological education is
concerned to do more than describe the faith; it is concerned to (3) “<u>prove</u>”
it. Theological education learns more than what relates to conversion; it
concerns itself also with growth (Hebrews <b>5</b> and the meat of the word). To
persevere to the end, we need a growing confidence in the gospel’s truthfulness
as well as an increasing knowledge that things are the way they are revealed
rather than some other way (as in other religions or in the secular mind). We
must be able to give reasons for the hope that is within us (1 Peter <b>3</b>:15). 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Not only does “giving
reasons” mean providing evidence <u>for</u> what we believe; it involves giving
reasons <u>against</u> alternatives afloat in the world; it means disproving
error. That calls for knowing what errors </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
color:windowtext'>exist</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> and showing why
they are less adequate or just plain false. Unfortunately, false teachers always
abound, <i>“whose mouths must be stopped”</i> (Titus <b>1</b>:11).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Finally, “teaching” requires
(4) <u>practical skill at approaching issues</u>. Faithful teachers must
understand people and be able to work with them in ways that do not undo in
method what they understand in doctrine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:
18.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>            <i>“Teaching faithful people
who can teach others</i>” perpetuates, expands, and matures Christ’s church
until he returns. It calls for going beyond <u>recognizing</u> to <u>generating</u>,
going beyond <u>describing</u> to <u>proving,</u> going beyond <u>knowing</u>
to <u>understanding,</u> and going beyond <u>understanding</u> to <u>presenting</u>.
Equipping people for the “teaching office” means concentrating on those who can
reproduce themselves. Efficiency calls for it, economics demands it, and the
goal of theological education requires it.</span></p>
