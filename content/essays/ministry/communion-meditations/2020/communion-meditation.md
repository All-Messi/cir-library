Natural Ways to Cope

Rejection by the masses, ridicule by religious leaders, abandonment by disciples, and suffering from the Romans combined in the culminating event of the Messiah’s earthly life. He made it through that horrible experience by appealing to resources outside himself: the angel that <em>“ministered to him”</em> in the Garden, prayer to the Father, commitment to the purpose inside of <em>“your will, not mine”</em> and looking to the future joy beyond the present pain.

None of these resources were supernatural miracles of relief or superior forces available as from the legions of angels he could have called on. He dealt with the circumstance the same way we have to: prayer, resolve, and hope. This symbolic meal shows us how to cope who have dedicated ourselves to the One who dedicated himself to us for our eternal welfare.
