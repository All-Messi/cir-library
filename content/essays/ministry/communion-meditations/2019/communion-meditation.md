Easter the Confidence Builder

The loaf and cup represent reasons for looking forward to the final proof of our faith. Our Lord’s vicious death sets up the fact of his victorious resurrection over death and over the ones that did it to him.

Jesus did not die from age, sickness, starvation, some accident, or a capital crime. He <em>“shed his blood,”</em> which means he died in an unnatural way. He did not just bleed from a cut; he bled to death from crucifixion. The wonderful thing about this horrible thing is that it gives us the greatest confidence imaginable in the truthfulness of what we believe. It likewise gives us the greatest confidence imaginable that God loves us. Nobody does something like that unless he genuinely loves.

Our observance together, then, is a confidence builder about him, about our relationship to him, and the final triumph through him.
