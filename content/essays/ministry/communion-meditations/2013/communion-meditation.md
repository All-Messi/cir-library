Aspiration to Be like Christ

People are who they are. They are also who they aspire to be.

We are who we are. We are also who we choose to become.

And from the former we strain toward the latter. Aspiration is better embodied in a real person than in an abstract ideal. We shortchange ourselves in choosing other people to emulate.  But on this occasion we remember an ever-present example from the past who was tempted in all points like we are, yet without sin.

From one end of ministry to the other came self-denial instead of stones to bread and voluntary crucifixion in place of worldwide glory.

Ingesting this loaf and this cup, we internalize that same kind and degree of commitment to God through Christ—aspiration to appropriate selflessness and to avoiding temptation to distraction and disobedience.
