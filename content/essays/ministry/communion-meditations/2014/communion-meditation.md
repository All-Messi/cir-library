Being There

We song asks, <em>“Were you there when they crucified my Lord?”</em> Putting ourselves in that event helps us appreciate what went on there. Eating this bread and drinking this cup, puts us in the event and give us a taste of what it took for Christ to do God’s will.

By extension, today’s participation in that event through communion, moves us to step up for what it takes to do the Father’s will here and now in us. The past in Christ becomes key to the present in us.
