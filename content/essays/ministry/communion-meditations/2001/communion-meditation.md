Connecting to Christ

Holding your late father’s wedding ring brings a sense of connection with him. It reminds you of who he was, what he did for you, the attitude he took toward you.

Holding the emblems Jesus left behind has a similar effect. They put us in touch with the One whose abused body and shed blood they resemble. We who wear his name keep alive in ourselves all that he stood for, especially as expressed in the crowning act of his earthly ministry.
