Isaiah <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>:2-12

Isaiah looked forward to see what we are looking back to remember: the suffering of Another because of what we have done. Were it not for our failures, there would have been no need for him to be saddened, misunderstood, despised, rejected, and abused to death.

Isaiah meant more than that our actions cause other people grief and pain. He meant more than that we’re the ones who deserve what they suffer. He meant more than that we cannot disentangle ourselves from the consequences of our own deeds against other people. He meant more than that we’re all included in this indictment (<strong><sup>53</sup></strong>:6).

Isaiah meant that one Other (11) bore the brunt of our iniquities (6), that the one Other was not guilty of anything, so not just anybody could serve that purpose. He meant that the Other did not try to escape from the role God had assigned him (7), that the Other gave everything he had—his all (12). So God will account him worthy of greatness and great reward (12).

Today we’re looking back to Isaiah’s prophesied fulfillment and honoring the One that has done for us what no one else could do.
