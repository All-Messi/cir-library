Only One

God does not need a majority in order to win. That’s because of what’s “won.” Force cannot form friendships. Force is used to get results that are beyond what naturally leads to an effect. Authority and force wielded by a few can “make” the majority do what they do not want to do, but interpersonal associations require persuasion to freely accept what is offered, not forced. That’s why it is said, <em>“The quality of mercy is not forced.”</em>

Romans <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:17-19 explains how the one relates to the many in our faith. Our Lord’s righteousness “spreads” to other people by grace (17). It is “given” because it takes place in the will of Another. God views righteousness upon us because we have identified with, and committed to, the One who is righteous.

Christ is the One that many can identify with unto being viewed by God as righteous like him. Observing these representations of him indicates our commitment to him as a recurring and continuing affirmation. They are tokens of truth about who the One is that we the many are part of.
