<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             In the past, extreme positions have been
taken on both sides of the “<u>preacher competition</u>” issue in hiring a
minister. At one extreme is the practice of bringing in three or four ministers
for “trial sermons” and then taking a vote on which one the people want. At the
other extreme is the policy ministers may advocate that search committees look
at only one candidate at a time and decide yes or no before passing on to the
next one. It seems curious that ministers want to look at several congregations
and decide which one to take, but they do not want a congregation looking at
more than one minister. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Obviously the procedure for hiring a
minister must have the congregation’s best interests at heart without creating
a contest atmosphere out of the situation. A congregation may not be able to
tell whether other prospects are going to be any stronger than the one they are
now looking at but may not be entirely satisfied with. Other stronger prospects
may not accept the ministry there. To get a feel for the relative strengths of
more than one prospect, the selection committee can interview more than one
candidate, compare resumes, check references, conduct telephone conversations,
and the like–anything short of presenting more than one at a time to the whole
congregation. Doing the latter creates a situation where some like one
candidate and some like another and division can result. It also puts too much
emphasis on pulpit ability relative to the other skills needed in a healthy
ministry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             If at all possible, you should take your <u>wife
and family</u> along with you to the church where you are interviewing. The
wife will probably not be involved in the interview itself (although there can
be some advantages to her being present). Nevertheless she and the children
will need to establish a sense of belonging with the future move you and the
congregation decide to make. Your wife and kids will want to see what kind of
living arrangements to expect. It is good for the congregation to see the
personality of your spouse and to see how the kids behave toward you. They will
be able to tell how well all of you meet people you do not know. They will feel
more confident about all of you if they can see that you are not withdrawn or
backward people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Depending on the circumstance, it is
advisable to have more than just one evening to interact with the situation. You
will want to drive around the community, see where the schools are located,
meet as many of the church leaders as you can in an unstructured setting, look
at the parsonage if the church has one, survey the facilities, meet other staff
people the congregation may have and get a chance to talk with them informally.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>  II.  Sample Questions for Ministers to Ask</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       1.   Does the church have by-laws, an
organizational chart for the work of the church that includes staff members and
their roles as well as a list of the active committees, and anything else that
would indicate the variety of ministry, the number of people actively involved
in it, and so on? What governing board do you look to for final responsibility?
Who is on this board? What “officers” do you have in the church? Who has the
authority to hire and dismiss staff members? These and other factors will help
you get an idea about how the operation of the church is carried out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       2.   What <u>job description</u> do you use for
the minister? Do not be surprised if they have a difficult time verbalizing
what it is that they expect from a minister. Working out expectancies for the
ministry may end up being something that you will actually do in the interview
if other considerations are going well. You will need to inform them about many
of the behind-the-scenes activities a minister performs. In smaller churches–or
in churches that do not have very many people who have a very clear idea of
what ministers do, the people will tend to develop a “job description” that
ends up equally the sum total of all the things they can see and imagine that
needs to be done in a church: youth work, hospital and shut-in visitation,
preaching, teaching a Sunday school class, conducting a mid-week Bible
study/prayer meeting, calling on prospects for conversion and membership,
counseling people with difficulties, being involved in community activities,
perhaps even taking care of the grounds. That list has to be identified as the
ministry of the church rather than the work of the minister. Obviously a
minister has more time to do these things than other people do, but unless the
congregation is very small he will not be able to do all these things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Together you will need to go through the
total list of things needing to be done and select the ones you will
concentrate on and agree to work out later how the other tasks can be covered. Consequently,
it is a good idea to have at least a mental list of typical tasks to survey in
making out a realistic picture of what your abilities, energies, and situation
enables you to do. It may be advisable to list these activities on a blackboard
and put <u>time</u> amounts beside each one in order to help the interviewers see
that all their expectancies cannot be met by one person. You may be able to
arrive at some <u>percentages</u> of your time that together you would
tentatively assign to each activity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       3.   How do you view the minister’s role in
relation to other leaders of the church? Do you conceive of the elders and the
minister as having an employer-employee relationship, or from a practical
standpoint is this a team effort? To put it differently, do you think of the
minister as the one you hire to do the work or to lead in doing it? It may be
helpful to encourage looking at the minister as someone supported so he can
concentrate on that work, a work others are involved in also insofar as their
time and energy allows. He is also someone who has had more learning
opportunities than the other men normally have had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       4.   Who are the <u>leaders</u> in the church
and what vocations do they have?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       5.   What kind of <u>program</u> do you
presently have: Bible studies, Sunday school, system, outreach, visitation for
shut-ins, etc.? How are the people responding to it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       6.   What meetings in the church (and
community) is the minister expected to attend? Is he expected to attend all
committee meetings and all Sunday-school class socials?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span

congregation typically allow/expect the minister to make?</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       8.   What are the <u>demographics</u> of the
community and the church: age groups, classes of people, professional people,
community leaders, retired people, vocations represented? Are there certain
strata that the church seems to draw its membership from?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>       9.   Is a <u>map</u> of the area, especially
one that shows where members live in relation to the church?</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     11.   What tensions in the church should I be
sensitive to in coming into this ministry? What is the quality of race
relations in the community and how have these affected the church? Are there
any “pet peeves” the minister here needs to avoid? How the leadership gets
along can be surmised by the atmosphere in the interview itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     12.   Find out what kind of special difficulties
may be in the community and in the church so you can be on the lookout for them
should you decide to accept the ministry and so you can assess whether you can
deal with those matters. What have been some of the more significant events in
the life of this congregation since you have been involved here? What has been
the most upsetting experiences in the past?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     14.   Try to find out the circumstances
surrounding the last change of ministry. What kinds of things was the previous
minister good at? In what areas do you wish your previous ministers would have
had more expertise? Who have been the past ministers for the church, how long
have their ministries lasted, and what have been some reasons for their
leaving?</span></p>

and long-range goals? </span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     16.   What is the present membership of the
church and how does that compare with the attendance figures? How do Sunday

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     17.   What kind of missions outreach does the
congregation support beyond the local body? What Bible College/s and
missionaries does the church support and how closely are they aligned with
these efforts? Does the church support an area evangelizing association?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span

support and how many young people are involved each year in the camping
program?</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     19.   Try to find out what the image of the
congregation is in the community and what kind of relationships the church has
with other churches in the area. Particularly you want to discover what
attitude the leadership takes toward these other groups. Are the regular area
men’s and women’s meetings? Are there interdenominational gatherings such as
prayer breakfasts that people in the church attend? What kind of attitude do
you think is appropriate toward Christians outside this brotherhood? Would
there be any objection to using resource people from outside the brotherhood in
areas where their distinctives would not affect their assistance to us in this
ministry?</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>     20.   How comfortable are the people with variety
and change in the way worship and ministry is carried on in the church? Have
changes in the worship service disrupted the congregation in the past? Is the
minister typically in charge of the service? </span></p>

church? How much indebtedness does it have? What is the giving per capita? What
is the church’s program of stewardship? What is the size of the church budget? How
much of the budget goes to missions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     22.   What kind of attitude would the leadership
take toward your possible interest in continuing education? What kinds of
assistance have you given former ministers to help them improve their work? There
are seminars conducted across the country that help in the practical day-to-day
work of the kingdom. Some seminaries have developed Master of Ministry programs
specifically for ministers who cannot leave the area of service and spend one
to three years on a campus following formal educational pursuits.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>     23.   Does the congregation typically have a
contract with the minister? Encourage having one, because people often forget
the terms of agreement and it keeps things more objective. Be sure, however,
not to make the agreement so detailed that it locks you into an inflexible
circumstance.</span></p>

pentecostalism and the charismatic movement), baptism, women’s work, the

church? You can explain to them her skills, interests, past experience in
church work, and the way she has functioned in the past to complement and
reinforce you both personally and in the work of the church. It is best on this
question to include something to the effect that she will do her part like the
rest of the women in the congregation. Do not give the impression that, so to
speak, the church will be getting two ministers for the price of one. After all
she, like they, is a wife and mother and may be working outside the home as
well.</span></p>
