<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Sunday. </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'>Nobody in the Bible is pictured more vividly than the apostle Peter. His
growth from a rash fisherman into an unwavering witness for the Christian faith
offers a challenge to every disciple of Jesus. Early on, Jesus foreshadowed this
change when he changed his name from Simon to Cephas—a rock (Peter). (</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Monday. </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'>Peter presents the strange combination of virtues and faults that so
characterizes all of us. One minute he is borne aloft on a triumphant blessing
from Jesus because of his Great Confession of faith; the next minute he is
plunged into the depths by Christ’s stinging rebuke: <i>“Get behind me, Satan!”
</i>There is some of Simon in ius all<i>. </i>(</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;line-height:115%'>Read Matthew<b> 16</b>:13-23</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Tuesday. </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'>Peter had amazing trust in Jesus. One night the twelve, caught alone on
the Sea of Galilee, were drenched in a wild fury of destruction. Then Peter saw
his master in the midst of the raging water and asked to walk with him on the
waves. Could any of us have trusted Jesus enough to leave the safety of the
boat for the dangers of the deep? (</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Read Matthew <b>14</b>:22-30</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Wednesday. </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Peter was a worker, a rolling stone that gathered no moss. He
could work all night and follow Jesus all day. Simon Peter would not have been
content to sit on top of a pillar becoming “holy” as did a fifth-century
namesake Simon Stylites. Idleness is never a virtue; he that doesn’t work
shouldn’t eat. (</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>Read
Luke <b>5</b>:1-11; 2 Thessalonians <b>3</b>:10</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Thursday. </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Peter was a spokesman for Christ. When the authorities
arrested the apostles and brought them into court, Peter was the one that spoke
up in defense of the gospel and firmly declared that he and his associates
would continue to preach it as before. There is a place today for Christians
bold enough to stand their ground and stick to their guns. (</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>Read Acts <b>5</b>:26-32</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Friday. </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'>Peter would contend against all odds and at all costs to himself. Just
outside the gate of Gethsemane, he drew his sword against the whole mob that
came to capture his Lord. As it turned out, he did the wrong thing; but God
used his spirit of attack to establish the church in the very city where these
Jewish leaders killed the Lord. God still needs people like Peter to carry the
battle against overwhelming majorities at the expense of their own welfare. (</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>Read John <b>18</b>:1-11</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Saturday. </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Jesus probably reprimanded Peter more than anyone else. So
often Peter did wrong while trying to do right. Everyone that hopes to
accomplish anything will slip up now and then. A great man is not one that
doesn’t make mistakes but one that profits from them. The man that Jesus named
Peter has set an example that should encourage everyone that endeavors to
serve. (</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>Read John <b>21</b>:15-19</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>.)</span></p>
