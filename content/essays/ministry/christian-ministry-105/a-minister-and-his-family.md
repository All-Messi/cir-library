style='font-size:12.0pt'>         New Testament qualifications for leadership
deal not only with the person himself, but also with his domestic situation. Being
qualified for ministry includes, then, how your wife and kids act and how you
all relate to one another. The ongoing relationship within your family follows
the reciprocal pattern characteristic of all social relationships. How you
treat them affects how they treat you, and how they treat you affects how you
treat them. Consequently, the burden does not fall just on the minister in the
family. The emphasis here is, however, is on <u>your</u> side of the
interaction. It stresses the fact that your relationship toward them is
preliminary to how they subsequently enhance or detract from your ministry. Their
actions do not wholly reflect how you have first loved them and their actions
reflect other influences in their past and present lives, but there is a
correlation between the quality of how you treat them and how they conduct
themselves as a result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         It probably ought to be said as well here
that anyone considering leadership ministry needs to take honest inventory of
his family situation if he is already married and perhaps has children as well.
Maybe the wife is not a “public” person and would feel uncomfortable in such a
role even though in point of commitment to Christ she may feel “obligated” to
endorse your interest in doing the Lord’s work full time. Frankly she and the
children may have behavior immaturities that would not make them positive complements
to ministry. It would be better to have one less minister in the kingdom than
to have one who brings into ministry a counterproductive influence.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         The main difficulty in ministry is time
because there is no way to know when you are done. In such open-ended
situations you especially need to <u>schedule</u> time for yourself, your
spouse, and your children, since you cannot count on using leftover time for
family matters–there are no “after hours” in ministry. Scheduled time does not
mean it is not heartfelt time. Structure does not destroy spontaneity or
sincerity. It implies the opposite rather: it implies that you value being with
your wife and kids enough to plan for it. When you are laying out your time
budget, you simply need to include a healthy portion for wife and family along
with home chores and different parts of your job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Once in a while spend some money frivolously
on the rest of the family. You may not have enough money buy a season ticket
for the local professional football games, but you might “splurge” sometime and
take the kids to a game; they will never forget it! Part of what you are doing
is “making memories” for the wife, for the kids, for the family as a whole The
idea here is similar to Jesus’ praise of “wasteful love” when the woman poured
expensive ointment on him not long before his death. Being overly tight with
your money and time may cause the rest of the family to resent your work,
especially if they see you using these things for other people or for yourself
(buying books, for example). Little surprises once in a while are fun too, and
they can mean a lot particularly because they were not expected.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Marriage is first of all an interpersonal
experience. Beyond the general characteristics of interpersonal relationship
lie the distinctives of married relationship, and beyond that lies married
relationship in the context of ministry. <u>Activity</u> together is one of the
main factors that defines a group and gives it identity. A husband and wife’s
distinctive activity together is necessary for defining them as a “group” and
giving them identity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Give the wife some time away from the
responsibility of caring for the kids, particularly when they are young and
rather dependent on her. Take her out to eat or go somewhere and do something
together as a couple. Spend a night away from home together once in a while. Provide
ways for her to get away from the routine once in a while. You might do
something with the kids while she goes and does something she enjoys with other
ladies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Involve your wife in your ministry to some
reasonable extent. You can talk with her about your plans, hopes, concerns, and
the like so she has a feel for what you are doing. While it is important not to
“take it home with you,” she nevertheless needs to have a sense of what you are
doing. She may enjoy going calling with you once in a while; in fact, in some
cases it is rather critical that you protect yourself and your reputation by
having her accompany you.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Parenting is first of all an interpersonal
experience. Beyond the general characteristics of interpersonal relationship
lie the distinctives of parent-child relationship, and beyond that lies
parental relationship in the context of ministry. Again, <u>activity</u>
defines you and the children as belonging together. Doing things together
creates the healthy bonding that provides them security and a healthy
self-image. One simple thing to do with the kids is take each one out
individually to eat someplace and let him pick where the two of you will go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Be careful about overly divulging family
experiences, especially those that might reflect negatively on family members
or make them feel laughed at. This restraint includes anything that might be
interpreted as bragging on them because it might make them feel uncomfortable. Do
not tell stories on the kids in Sunday school, in sermons, or in other public
settings. It is a big temptation to use home life experiences to illustrate
ideas, because those experiences are so vivid to you. But telling such episodes
can make the kids feel to “looked at.” It betrays the privacy and safety of the
home and may show disrespect as well. Children neither want to be on a pedestal
or in a glass house. The concern here depends on the sense of rapport they kids
and wife have with the church people.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Ministry calls for quite a number of evening
commitments–calling, committee meetings, Bible studies, and other services. Perhaps
you can go home and do some things with them a couple hours before supper. There
ought to be at least one time during the day when the family does something
together. As children get a older and school activities multiply, the evening
meal may be harder to make into a family experience. You may need to use
breakfast for you common meal!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Keep the amount of TV time to some
reasonable, agree-on maximum and monitor the types of programs the kids are
watching. Not only are you concerned about what they are watching, but you are
concerned about the entertainment mentality that overindulgence causes. Besides,
the more time they spend watching TV the less time you have for relating to
them meaningfully and for doing things together as a family unit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         Show interest in your children’s activities: their
sports events, musical presentations, hobbies, homework, projects. Make youth
group and other church programs a natural <u>part</u> of their whole picture. Make
sure not to use their place as minister’s kids as a club over their heads to
make them behave. They will not only resent it but resent the ministry as well.</span></p>

also with the family unit <u>activity</u> together establishes the unit as an

together like music, fishing or hunting, sports, or just taking a hike.</span></p>
