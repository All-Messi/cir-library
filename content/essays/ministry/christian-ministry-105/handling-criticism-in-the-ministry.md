style='font-size:12.0pt'>              We reserve the word <u>criticism</u> for
illegitimate fault-finding. It means something negative because it has negative
cause, result, or both. Criticism is evil because it does not edify of others
but aggrandizes self. A critic’s conscious motive may be to hurt or offend, and
the person criticized feels that hurt. Criticism does not build up anyone or
improve the situation. It is not done the same way constructive efforts are
done. Many times critics do not go to the person himself, but air their
complaints to third parties or in public situations. They make their statements
in condemnatory tone of voice and in ways which imply their doubt that the
other person to be willing or able to make adjustments that correct. Their aim
is to evaluate rather than ameliorate–to condemn rather than to help</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>         A. <u>To get attention</u>. People criticize
because it gives them something easy to say. Offering solutions is harder than
observing that some proposed solution or current effort is not accomplishing
everything that would be well to have. People never criticize others for things
they also are guilty of; consequently, they are saying to people, “Look at me;
I do not have that fault.” By pointing out weaknesses they try to tell other
people that they themselves are intelligent, that they know the difference
between the way things are and the way they ought to be, that they know a
better way (though typically a critical person never allows himself or his
ideas to be put to the test and he seldom himself tries to do anything; that
would set him up for ridicule for failure).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>         B. <u>Because of distrust</u>. Criticism is
weakness behavior because it does not trust. Critics’ relatives and friends
have evidently been untrustworthy, and so they are automatically transferring
that feeling to you. It may take a while to show them that their fears are
unwarranted. Distrust amounts to fear. Critical people are driven by a sense of
insecurity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         C. <u>To gain control</u>. Criticism is also
weakness behavior because it represents (1) a felt need to be superior through
competition. Obviously criticism creates the opposite effect because a superior
person does not have to prove he is superior. Efforts to gain ascendancy by
tearing another person down prove the insecurity of the critic, and they
indicate how low his own level is by the level to which he has to bring you in
order to feel above you. In other words, people criticize you because they feel
intimidated by you. Critics have the feeling of gaining the upper hand because
they can see that their comments make the other person uncomfortable. It “puts
the him on the spot.” They often misreading this response, however. The other
person may be uncomfortable, not because he feels guilty but because he feels
frustrated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             The desire to gain control may be more
diffused, or ambiguous. They may be afraid of what negative things might do to
them; so they be trying to get (2) a sense of mastery over the situation by
verbalizing about it. What they say is not really so much of a comment on you
as it is an attempt to subdue the situation.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>         D. <u>Because silence feels like approval</u>.
Much admonition against being critical goes unheeded because people fudge that
admonition into the idea that they should not criticize unless it is justified,
which puts them right back at square one. They have confused being critical
with lying. What person ever criticized someone without thinking he was
justified in it? Admonition against critical behavior also goes unheeded
because people assume they are not to criticize unless they can do a better job
of it. Since many people magnify their abilities in their own mind, they do not
profit from the warning.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         E. <u>Out of habit</u>. Often critical people
do not realize what they are doing it. Because of their upbringing they
habitually seeing what is wrong around them, and “have” to say something about
it.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>         F. <u>Because you have been criticizing them</u>.
Preachers are as critical as anyone and they often take advantage of the pulpit
to do it. Warning people about sin gets skewed into criticizing people for
their sins. Negative preaching–“hell-fire and brimstone,” even if it is not
aimed at anyone in the audience, nevertheless sets the example being overtly
negative toward what is wrong in the world and in people rather than offering
solutions to the problems or devising ways to help people develop from where
they are to where they ought to be.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         A. <u>Prevent criticism before it happens</u>.
We say, “Prevention is the best cure.” (1) <u>Build relationships</u> with your
people more than implement programs, and you will avoid a lot of criticism. You
will be building trust and people do not criticize their friends, the people
they like, the people they think like them, the people they feel close
to–people they think they can trust; so be their friend. The closer you are to
your people the less they will be inclined to think negatively of you or feel
intimidated by you. Reduce distance and you reduce criticism. Since criticism
is a self- protection mechanism some people get into the habit of using, they
will not criticize what they do not fear. Affirm them and do not be their
enemy. Since people normally treat you the way you have treated them, make sure
you do not criticize them. Being positive toward them pays off in a number of
ways including their not being negative toward you in the form of criticism. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             (2) <u>Build people up</u>. As with most
weakness behavior, criticism ultimately stems from low self-esteem. When you
edify people, you forestall negativism about themselves, their situation, and
their impressions of you. Critics are weak or socially awkward; otherwise they
would give constructive suggestions instead of destructive criticism. Obviously
you cannot be best friends with everybody all the time, but it is worth the try
to communicate some way to these people that you value them. Raising their
self-esteem will lower their criticism.                                       </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         (3) <u>Evaluate your own work and life</u>. If
we judge ourselves, we will not be condemned by others (cp. 1 Corinthians <b>11</b>:31).
We will be spotting weaknesses and correcting them, which averts criticism for
what we would otherwise have omitted or committed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         B. <u>Consider the criticism possibly true</u>.
In order to protect ourselves against the devastation that criticism usually
brings us, we can (1) try to disregard it altogether. While you cannot let it
get you down, you can consider whether there is a “kernel of truth” in it. Just
shoving it aside without further thought eliminates any changes you might make
that would lead to ending of criticism. Another reaction is to (2) try to play
up the weaknesses of the critic whether great or small in comparison to what he
is saying about you. This kind of reaction simply turns the Gold Rule “on its
ear” by responding in kind. Part of the issue has to be whether the fault
actually exists. If it does, then change or apology may be all it takes to get
rid of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         C. <u>Listen beyond the specific criticisms</u>.
(1) Many times people are legitimately uneasy about  things, but they
misidentify the problem. Since they think the real problem is coming from this
or that, they say negative things about it without considering the possibility
that they are misanalyzing things.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             (2) Criticism may be a function of
inadequate relationship between you and your critics. Their complaining is more
of a cry for love than it is a call to opposition. Their feeling left out,
disregarded, overlooked, unappreciated may express itself dysfunctionally as
criticism of your ministry. If you have not done enough to prevent the
occurrence, even after it starts you may be able defuse it by attention, but
you have to be careful not to get a pattern going where you pay attention to
them when they criticize and then back off when the criticism abates. They may
consciously start it up again to get your attention; most criticism is
attention-getting behavior anyway. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             (3) Sometimes people do not want to come
right out and tell you tell what is bothering them because it may be too “touchy.”
Maybe you or your wife are too bossy sounding, too withdrawn, too slow-moving. Your
personal hygiene may need improvement or you are too sloppy in your dress. You
may be boring in the pulpit. If the real difficulty is something they do not
think you can change or are likely to change, they will bring up other things
that are in a sense “excuses”; but they may really be doing it to keep from
destroying you with “a low blow.” We have the saying, “Where there is smoke
there is fire.” That means that if criticism is growing there is actually
something wrong; so do not “blow it of”; try to figure out what the problem
really is.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         D. <u>Find out how many people are
dissatisfied</u>. Criticism often seems more extensive than it is because it “sticks
out.” A few vocal people can make a bigger impression than they should be
allowed to make. You also need to figure out whether this handful of people has
some hidden agenda. Occasionally some friend or relative has become available
for ministry; their objection to you is only a ruse for trying to get this
other person. That may be coupled with a “<u>power play</u>” to solidify
control of the congregation by getting someone they can handle or someone they
perceive to be on their side in some way. If there is discord, remember that
most dissatisfaction with a minister does not involve everyone in the church. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             One reason criticism can be so
destructive is that you are not in a good position to tell whether it is
legitimate. You cannot see yourself as others see you. There is always more
that you could do and you could always do it better, but it is hard for you to
determine whether .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             Look to see whether the ones criticizing
you are just negative people–people who characteristically complain about other
people’s failures, evil motives, sins, and weaknesses. People that have a
negative style are weak people, perhaps afraid of failure, and typically
untrusting of others. Consider also whether they are likely to be in a position
to know the truth about what they are criticizing before you “let it get to
you.”</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         E. <u>Keep people aware</u>. Criticism is
born of fear and fear is born of ignorance. You can prevent a lot of criticism
by letting people know <u>what</u> you are doing; otherwise they may fear that
you are not doing anything and criticize you because they do not have a very
good feel for what ministers do. By volunteering the reasons <u>why</u> you are
doing something, you may offset the fear that your motives are somehow not
good.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>         F. <u>Deal with criticism impersonally</u>. Do
not flinch; respond, but do not react. Ask matter-of- fact questions relevant
to the criticism. Keep your voice even; be pleasant; give unhurried statements
to explain what’s and why’s. Consider their criticisms as much a comment on
themselves as on you. Be descriptive rather than evaluative in your own
comments. Silence is a strong response to criticism. If someone passes on to
you the fact that a person in the church has said something negative about your
ministry, smiling and letting it pass without comment communicates that you are
not worried about, that it is not true, and therefore that you are strong
enough that something so small is not problem. Make sure never to say something
about it again to the informant or to anyone else. Talking about things is what
keeps them alive; silence kills them; so let them die of inattention. Unless it
is a serious charge you do not need to go and accost the person who has accused
you of something or criticized your work. Getting a reaction out of you only
reinforces his tendency to think he is right and you are guilty.</span></p>

this admonition calls for more than a person can do consistently. The better
you are at it, however, the more stable your ministry will be, and the stronger
image you will project, which in turn will reduce the criticism people feel
inclined to level against you.</span></p>
