margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.  Will you perform ceremonies only for <u>members</u>
of the congregation where you serve?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            If your congregation has an especially
fine facility, you will have more requests from people outside the church to
have their weddings there. Many larger churches have more than one sanctuary. Besides
the main auditorium they may have a chapel that seats a hundred or so and maybe
even a prayer chapel that will accommodate a dozen or so. Consequently, the
church is ideally equipped to handle private weddings, moderate-sized
ceremonies, as well as large gatherings. Under those conditions the facility
meets the needs of practically all possibilities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Weddings can occupy a good deal of <u>time</u>
when you consider rehearsal time and counseling sessions, which will number
from one to six or more, depending on your policy. Simply to keep weddings from
overrunning your schedule, you may have to devise some policies. One way to
keep them manageable is to require that at least one of the persons be a member
of the church. Congregations that have extensive facilities probably have
multiple staff as well; you may be able to work out some kind of arrangement
among you that can accommodate more of these requests from non-members. Nevertheless,
limiting weddings to church members is still an option.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There are some difficulties with a
members-only policy. <u>Past members</u> may want to return to have the
ceremony at “the home church.” Requests may also come from <u>relatives of
members</u>. You may want to consider what might happen if you refused to
perform a ceremony for <u>regular attenders</u> or for one of their relatives. A
members-only policy can cause hurts feelings unless it is qualified in some way
or simply used as a guideline with cases-by-case exceptions made discreetly.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Ministers sometimes shy away from doing
ceremonies for non-Christian couples. This aversion may be due to their
tendency to regard marriage as a <u>Christian</u> institution. More often they
fear that a <u>minister’s</u> doing the wedding in a <u>church</u> may falsely
imply approval of their lives before God. If you do perform such weddings, you
may want to drop out Christian items like pronouncing the couple husband and
wife “in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” By coming to a minister
instead of going to a justice of the peace, they are probably indicating a
desire for a church wedding and a certain nebulous sense of wanting a religious
connection with their married life. It would seem more appropriate to fan any
spark of religious interest than to turn them away and thus turn them off to
that minimal religious impulse. You may be able to talk quite naturally with
them about spiritual things that have so much to do with a fulfilling life
together. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.  Should you perform a ceremony for a <u>Christian
and non-Christian</u>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Part of the issue here is what you
consider “non-Christian.” There is a difference between a non-Christian and a <u>nominal
Christian</u>, between a non-Christian and someone from <u>another denomination</u>,
and between a non-Christian and an <u>anti-Christian</u>. Practically speaking,
some “good moral people” make better mates for a Christian than do those
relatively active “Christians” that have personality defects their Christianity
has not corrected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A second part of the issue is whether “marrying
in the Lord is advice or commandment.” To put it differently, is it <u>sinful</u>
to “contract” a marriage with an unbeliever or is it <u>ill-advised</u>? Since
it is not sinful to “continue” a mixed marriage, we assume it is for practical
rather than theological reasons that Paul says what he does about not marrying
outside the faith (1 Corinthians <b>7</b>:39; cp. 2 Corinthians<b> 6</b>:14).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Another part of the issue is how you
should conceive of “your role” in such cases. Is it your responsibility to try
to stop ill-advisable marriages or to enhance the tendency toward making them
more advisable? Is it realistic to assume a role that even parents of the
couple would have a hard time fulfilling at this stage of the relationship’s
development? As a minister is it possible not to apply those values and
principles that belong to the message you proclaim? Can you perform the wedding
in a way that does not imply your approval or disapproval? The couple has not
come for your blessing or your approval, but for your services. With rare
exceptions the fact is that they will get married; so the issue is not whether
they ought to marry or whether you think they should marry. The issue is
whether you can improve their future life together and help insure their
marital success. By performing the wedding you do not have to be approving the
marriage, although admittedly it is difficult to separate the fact that you are
a Christian minister and the fact that you are performing a wedding that is
immoral. So you have to decide whether you are obligated to apply to
non-Christians the values of a belief system they have not adopted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            A last part of the issue is what the
parents of the Christian may think of you and the church if they have been
trying to keep their son or daughter from marrying this non-Christian. You have
to balance off their interest in the matter with the welfare of the couple
themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>4. Should you perform the ceremony for a couple if <u>one
or both have been divorced</u>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            There are many types of specific problems
here; so it is difficult to come up with an answer that fits them all. You may
be asked to perform the ceremony for an apparently guilty party in a previous
divorce who wants a public wedding in the same church where his previously wife
still attends. You will probably not be able to figure out whether a person was
the “innocent party” in a previous divorce. If you are convinced that a “guilty
party” should never remarry, about all you can realistically assume responsibility
for is communicating to the person involved that this is your viewpoint, and
then you will have to leave the responsibility with them. Whether you go ahead
and perform the ceremony will be determined by the role you perceive that a
minister should take in marriage.</span></p>

unlikely <u>marital partners</u>?</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            The government has certain restrictions on
who can marry and who can marry whom. Beyond these regulations you will
probably not succeed at preventing ill-advised marriages. A more realistic
approach is to make available to them tests that will reveal the differences
between them, and then make suggestions for minimizing these differences,
understanding them, and changing the ones that ought to be changed. In general,
this redemptive approach coincides with the stance Christianity takes toward
people between Christ’s first and second comings. Occasionally this procedure
will cause the couple to reconsider, but it will always ameliorate the problems
they may encounter.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>             In America racially mixed marriages are
more common and more accepted today than they were a generation ago. Although a
few Christian groups consider such marriages immoral, the question of
advisability does need attention from a societal standpoint. You are not in a
very good position to deter the man and woman from carrying through with such
an arrangement especially at this late date in the relationship. In some parts
of the country there may still be enough public sentiment against interracial
marriage that you should consider what effect marrying a black and white couple
might have on your ministry or that of the congregation you are serving. At
least you should work out in your mind how you will deal with any negative
reactions that come from the church or community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>6. Should you require the couple to have <u>counseling</u>
before marrying them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Many ministers adopt this approach as a
way of fulfilling their responsibility toward the couple in a day when marriage
vows are sometimes taken too lightly and as a way of actually helping upgrade
their commitment to marriage and their likelihood of success in the marriage. Adopting
this policy also weeds out people that are unreceptive to the spiritual values
that undergird such counseling. Consequently the minister is spending his time
in a manner that is more in keeping with his calling. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            People sometimes hesitate and resist
counseling. Resistance may not mean disinterest in spiritual things so much as
a fear that the minister will get too directive (“pushy”) on religious things
they are not too sure about. After all, they do not know the minister
personally in many cases, and they envision a worst-case scenario rather easily
if they are not regular church people. Young couples may be apprehensive of
talking about highly personal matters. Frankly in cases where they do not know
you very well, that concern is understandable since you have no basis for
credibility with them.</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Some ministers set a flat fee. Others
consider weddings and funerals as part of their responsibility in the ministry
of the church that supports them. A minister could graciously accept an
voluntary honorarium and then return it to the couple as a present on their
first anniversary. That would give him a natural opportunity for renewed
contact with them. Ministers sometimes do not charge members of their
congregation, but set a fee for outsiders. An honorarium can be considered
partial repayment for any books or other materials the minister provides at his
own expense during the planning meetings and counseling sessions. All in all it
seems best not to set a fee, and to consider a voluntary honorarium as a
gesture of appreciation more than a payment for services. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Besides having the wedding in the church
building, informal weddings may be held in the minister’s living room, in an
open-air situation, or in the home of one of the parents. Any setting that does
not compromise the solemnity of the ceremony should be acceptable. You need to
be careful about performing ceremonies at another church. You should have the
couple contact the minister of that congregation, and it would be a good idea
to make a personal contact as well since there is a certain respect for the other
minister’s ministry that has become traditional in ministerial etiquette. You
do not want to get caught in some disaffection between the minister and the
couple or one of their families so as to affect your own relationship with that
minister.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>            Refusing to perform ceremonies in certain
circumstances may be cutting off opportunities for <u>outreach</u>. This matter
applies to religiously or racially mixed couples, couples where one or both is
not a Christian, couples where one or both have previously been divorced. Ministers
are always looking for natural points of contact with unreached people; yet
here is one of those potential contacts you may be overlooking. It largely
depends on how you integrate these cases into planned outreach; that is,
whether you require counseling sessions, whether you always make at least a “soft-sell”
presentation of the gospel to persons without a personal relationship to Jesus
Christ. You may have to go at this question in a trial-and-error fashion to see
whether this situation in fact produces very many converts and recommitments in
comparison to other occasions of evangelism. Marriage is one time in people’s
lives when they are in the process of change, and those times are the ones in
which conversions most naturally and frequently come because of the greater
felt need for security and therefore greater openness to the Christian message.</span></p>
