<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            It’s
easy to suppose that we stand here at the end of a life to pay our “final
respects” at a “final resting place.” Existence appears to be over because life
is over. What remains seems to be dealing with the impact on us who remain. The
happiness of good memories combines with the sadness of losing the source of
that happiness. Sunshine on this cold winter’s day pictures our conflicted
feelings. We have only to wait till time turns the winter of our loss to the
summer of new things to come in life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            But
most of us are not satisfied with such a take on what we’re experiencing here
today. It seems too impersonal, too “objective” to cover the way we feel. The
complete picture is what we know <u>and</u> what we feel. A long time ago
Solomon said that God has planted eternity in our hearts (Ecclesiastes <b>3</b>:11).
That sentiment feels like our lack of ability to imagine not existing. At the
very least, it fits with not wanting to cease existing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <u>Words</u>
about such a later time help to the extent that we are inclined to believe the
one who said them. It’s more helpful, though, to have an <u>example</u> who
came back from “the other side.” That would confirm to us that there is “a
beyond” that’s beyond what we can experience now. In the Christian view of
things, we have in scripture some examples of “resurrection.” Those are
examples of returning from beyond the grave. In particular, we look to our
Lord’s resurrection as the main case in point. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            But
more important than words and examples is his <u>promise</u> of our own
resurrection. It’s a promise to us who choose to wear his name, and commit ourselves
to living here as he taught us: intentionally living in love toward him and
each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <i>“Don’t worry,” </i>Christ
said<i>; “you believe in God; believe in me as well. There are many rooms in my
Father’s house. If it weren’t so, I would’ve told you, because I’m going to get
a place ready for you. If I do that, I’ll come back and get you so you can be
where I am”</i> (John <b>14</b>:1-3a).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            We
comfort one another with these words from the One who came back from beyond and
promised hope for <u>us</u>, a hope beyond the place and time for each of us that
will be like the one we’re witnessing here today.</span></p>
