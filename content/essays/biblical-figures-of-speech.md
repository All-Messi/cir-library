title: BIBLICAL FIGURES OF SPEECH
weight: 10
---




( ) = observations not expressly made by scripture itself

Boldface headings represent clusters of images.

* means the concordance has been used to create the list


Note distinction between figures of speech and figures of thought.

Note also the distinction between schemes (figures of thought) and tropes (= figures of words).

Figures of thought are represented by parables, allegories, Christ-Adam parallel, Hagar-Sarah, and so on. The words are literal, but their referent is substituted for the reality you mean.

Abraham’s sojourning in Palestine depicts the mentality toward the material world that

Christians have (Hebrews <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:8-10, 13-16).

(Asps; see “Vipers”)


Athletic games


Boxing (1 Corinthians<strong> 9</strong>:26; 2 Timothy <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:7?)

Living the Christian life is like running a race (Hebrews<strong> 12</strong>:1-3).

Ministering is like running a race (Galatians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:2; 2 Timothy<strong> 4</strong>:7).

Receiving the garland if he contends according to the rules (2 Timothy<strong> 2</strong>:5)


Baby


In contrast to an adult/full-grown man, one who is a beginner in spiritual instruction

(1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:1-2; Hebrews<strong> 5</strong>:13; 1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:2)


Babylon


A cryptogram for Rome (1 Peter<strong> 5</strong>:13; Revelation <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:8; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:19; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:5; <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:2, 10, 21)


Baptism


a. 	Cleansing (1 Corinthians<strong> 6</strong>:11?; Ephesians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:26?; Titus <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:5; Hebrews<strong> 10</strong>:22)

b.	Being overwhelmed

Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew<strong> 3</strong>:11 = Mark <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:8 = Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16 = John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:33)

Baptism of suffering (Matthew <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:22-23 = Mark 10:38-39; Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:50;

1 Corinthians <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:29?)

Baptism is a burial, picturing the death-resurrection of Jesus Christ, the most distinctive event in his life. Inasmuch as baptism is immersion it pictures burial—burial of the old way of life based in the flesh and the way of life that derives from values based only in fleshly considerations (Romans <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>).

Baptism is done in water, symbolizing cleansing.

In baptism a person is passive, correlating with salvation as grace by the

other.

In baptism the eyes are shut, breathing stops, hearing stops, as in death.


c.	Represents the Spirit

John the Baptist uses his baptism in water as an analogy for baptism in the Holy

Spirit.

In 2 Peter<strong> 3</strong>:21 water saves, gives life, as it did to Noah (via buoyancy), so it does now because water gives life: Jesus is a life-giving Spirit (1 Corinthians<strong> 15</strong>). “Water of Life”


Barren


Fruitless (James <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>)


Before/behind


Being “behind” someone means letting him be in charge (Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:23)

Being “ahead” of someone means being superior or being in charge of (John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:30).


Beget


Incarnation

Resurrection

Enthronement

Conversion


(Binding/Loosing; see “Keys”)


Birds


“Birds gathering around a carcass” is a picture of people gathered around a center of

attention, as at Christ’s return (Luke<strong> 17</strong>:37 = Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:28).


<strong><u>Birth images</u></strong>


Born

Paul speaks of himself as born out of due season, by which he means he was not part of the original cluster of Christ’s appearances. In that respect he is like a lamb or other animal born at the wrong time of the year. It is doubtful that he means premature birth since he compares it to being “later” than expected.

*“Born of woman” means “human being” (Luke<strong> 7</strong>:28; Matthew <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:11).

Travail represents extreme suffering (Isaiah <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:8; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:3-4; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:17-18; Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:8 =

Mark <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:8).

Travail represents extreme suffering in a loving God’s universe (Proverbs <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:6 >

Hebrews <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>).

Travail in birth is overshadowed by the joy of the child born (John <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:21-22; Isaiah

<strong><sup>66</sup></strong>:[7-]10-14).

*Travail in childbirth is something that cannot be escaped (1 Thessalonians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:3; Hosea

<strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:13; Micah <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:9-10).

The conversion of someone that a person yearns hard to see change. Paul is in travail

again till Christ be formed in the Galatians (Galatians<strong> 4</strong>:19).

Israel’s rebirth as a nation was quick as a woman delivering before her travail begins

(Isaiah <strong><sup>66</sup></strong>:7-9).

The whole creation suffers waiting for deliverance (Romans<strong> 8</strong>:22).

“Born again,” new birth, regeneration

John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:3-7, being “born again” (or “from above”) is being born of the water and the

spirit; it represents beginning again from a different starting point.

Titus <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:5, a statement associated with baptism, called a “washing of regeneration”

Compare Matthew <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:28, an end-time statement about the restoration of all things

Paul calls (re)converting someone giving birth to them (Galatians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:19).

James <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:18 says, <em>“Christ gave us birth by the word of truth.”</em>

Christ needs to be reformed in the Galatians, and Paul is in travail till they are

reborn in Christ (Galatians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:19).

1 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:3 says, <em>“Christ has begotten us again to a living hope.”</em>


(Blindness; see “Sight,” “Eyes”)


Blood


Blood being on someone’s head means his taking responsibility for his death (Matthew

<strong><sup>27</sup></strong>:25, Acts<strong> 5</strong>:28).

Drinking Jesus’ blood represents internalizing his values, power, identity (John <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:51-

58).

“Born of blood” is an expression for physical birth (John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:13).


(Blow on; see “Breathe on”)



<strong>Body figure</strong>


Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:29-30

1 Corinthians <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:12-30; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:16-17

Romans <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:3-8

Ephesus <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:6; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:4, 16-17


Comparisons involved between the church (a group of people) and a body

a. 	All the parts are needed; there are no jobless organs (no nascent or vestigial

organs)

b.	All the parts are not equally important

c.	All the parts do not do the same things

d.	Some parts are not essential for the existence of the organism although their absence may make it less efficient and effective; not equally important but equally necessary.

e.	Some of the less important parts may nevertheless require more attention to keep them functional. They are parts that we must deliberately do something for (cp. weaker brother)

f.	Unity and harmoniousness of the parts ideally and intentionally

g.	Interdependency

h.	Compenetration

i.	Reciprocal interaction

j.	Diversity

k.	What affects one affects them all; when one hurts they all hurt, so to speak.

l.	The body is a self-(re-)generating system; it <em>“builds </em><em><u>itself</u></em><em> up.”</em>

m.	We should not take the members of the body and make them members of a harlot (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:15-18). Paul calls for sanctity of the one relative to the other in contrast to foreign identification (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:14).

n.	When an eye or hand “offends” you, it is better to amputate it than let it ruin the whole body (Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:29-30). Applicable to church discipline (“a little leaven leavens the whole lump”) or perhaps divorce in the home setting.

o.	Weakness or loss of a member can be compensated for to some extent by the intensification of other capacities. The loss of sight increases the sensitivity of hearing and touch. Compensation

p.	The basis of worth lies in making a <em>contribution</em> to the operation of the body, which amounts to love; and that is where Paul moves to in 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>, having mentioned the body figure in <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:12-31. Love is the giving of oneself, or action for the welfare of others—the whole (body). In 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>12</sup></strong> the attributes of the individual members are tied in with the gifts a member has. Those “gifts” are “given” specifically for ministry to the rest. The approach to worth contrasts with <em>competition</em>, as demonstrated in the attitude, <em>“I don’t need you.”</em> The idea is not to get worth by setting others at naught. Worth is (1) a matter of action that fulfills purpose. Worth is also (2) a matter of belonging in contrast to the feeling, <em>“I am not part of the body.”</em> The basic problem among the Corinthians was the competitive mentality that manifested itself in the division problem (Chronicles <strong>1-4</strong>) and in the aberrant use of spiritual gifts.

q.	It is possible to get rid of a part of the body rather than let it ruin the rest.

example of the one and the many

r.	No one organ is the whole thing.

s.	Body figure measures worth in a complementary framework; a person has worth by making the contribution God wants a heart to make (as shown by the way he made it), not by being better than a knee or more indispensable than a fingernail.

t.	Body members do not act for themselves (hence, tongues are not for the

person?).

u.	Some body parts function for/in the body itself; some function for purposes

beyond it.


<strong><u>Body parts</u></strong>


Feet: putting someone under your feet/footstool means subjecting them (Psalm <strong><sup>110</sup></strong>:1; Matthew <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:44; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:64; Mark <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:36; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:19; Luke <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:42; Acts <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:25 (Psalm <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:8), 34; Hebrews<strong> 1</strong>:13; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:25, 27)

Eye represents awareness.

Ear represents paying attention to something.

Tongue represents communication.

Face to face/mouth to mouth represents direct contact rather than through an

intermediary.

Hand represents agency;

<em>“Not letting one hand know what the other one is doing” </em>represents doing

something in secret rather than for show.

Right hand represents preferred or privileged position (Psalm <strong><sup>110</sup></strong>:1 < Matthew <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:44; Mark <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:36; Luke <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:42; Acts <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:25 (Psalm <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:8), 34; Hebrews <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:12; 1 Peter <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:22)

Heart

“Being troubled” means a person is uncertain/fearful/worried (John <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:1, 27)

= “soul being troubled” (John<strong> 12</strong>:27).

= “troubled in spirit” (John <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:21).

Hebrew idiom has a general fondness for “body parts” imagery: “every eye will see him” (<em>vs</em>. everyone will see him); “by the hand of” = agency; “face/mouth to mouth/face” = directly; <em>etc</em>.


Boxing


1 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:26


Bread


Food serves as an image for spiritual sustenance (John<strong> 6</strong>:27; Matthew <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3-4 = Luke <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3-

4). (See also “Blood,” “Flesh,” “Communion.”)


Breathing on someone


Jesus “breathed on” the disciples in John <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:22 as a symbolic act that represented the

giving of the Spirit to them (“insufflation,” ἐνεφύσησεν, <em>enephysēsen</em>)


(Bridegroom; see “Weddings”)


*Bridle


Restrain or direct the tongue (James<strong> 1</strong>:26; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:2)


<strong>Building figures</strong>


Cornerstone

Jesus Christ is the cornerstone for the church (Psalm <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:22; <strong><sup>118</sup></strong>:22-23 + Isaiah <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>:16 < Matthew <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:42-44; Luke <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:17-18; Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:11; Romans <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:32-33; 1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:6-8; cp. Ephesians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:10)


Foundation

Parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders (Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:24-27 = Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:46-49)

Christ as the foundation of the church (1 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:9-15)

In 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong> the foundation emphasizes salvation.

In Matthew/Luke Sermon on the Mount/Plain, the foundation emphasizes Christ’s

Lordship.

The apostles and prophets as the foundation of the church with Christ as the

cornerstone (Ephesians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:19d-22; cp. Romans<strong> 15</strong>:20)

Jesus nicknames Simon as Peter/Cephas (Matthew <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:2 = Mark<strong> 3</strong>:16 = Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:14;

cp. John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:42; 2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:19).

Represents the first principles of Christianity (Hebrews <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:1)

The fact that Jesus is the Messiah is the foundation on which Christ builds his

church (Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:17-18).

Peter’s name meant “rock,” and he was so named by Jesus (Matthew <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:18; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:2; <strong>John 1</strong>:40-42) as a picture of a good foundation like the large rock that Caesarea was built on (Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:13ff.).


Prominent people in the church are like pillars* in a building (Galatians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:9; cp.

Revelation<strong> 3</strong>:12; cp. 1 Timothy <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:15, where the church is the pillar of truth.

Habitation/temple/house/tabernacle

Church as the habitation of God in the Spirit (Ephesians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:22; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16-

17; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:19? [probably a reference to an individual’s body]; 1 Peter<strong> 2</strong>:4-8)

The individual’s body is the temple of the Spirit (John <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:19-22; Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:58;

1 Corinthians <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:19)


See also “Tabernacle/Temple.”


A fire reveals how well the building is built (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>) as comparable to

judgment in the end or trials along the way.

The outward body decays but the inner man is renewed daily; it does not get old

(2 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:16-<sup>5:1</sup>ff.).

Dying is like losing the body and having another one replace it (2 Corinthians

<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:2ff.).

The body is like a tabernacle, a temporary and movable dwelling (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:1,

4; 2 Peter<strong> 1</strong>:13-14).

Going to heaven is like going home, where the Lord is (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:6-8).

An abandoned house represents Israel when God gave up the nation to the Romans

(Matthew <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:37)


Examples texts

Parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders (Matthew <strong>7:</strong>24-27)

Paul’s Preaching to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:10-15)

Paul, as the preacher, is a wise master builder (foreman?).

Jesus Christ is the foundation.

A man’s work is like different kinds of building materials that differ in their durability. The different materials are thought by some interpreters to represent acts of life, but it seems more likely that they represent persons won by a worker’s missionary activities.

Other workers’ additions to Paul’s original foundation work may be destroyed without the workman himself “suffering loss,” which probably means that those converted may not have a faith that stands the tests of time and temptation but that does not destroy the worker’s own status. (Peter speaks of individual Christians as living stones in the building/temple of God: 1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:5)

Other workmen are working on the same project—on one foundation, an

implication for unity in the work.

Consider ahead of time whether you have enough money to finish what you

start (Luke <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:28-30).


Burden


People that mooch off other people are like burdens to the other people

(2 Corinthians<strong> 11</strong>:9; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:14).


*Buying


A picture for God’s activity in saving man (Revelation <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:9; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:3, 4; 1 Corinthians<strong> 6</strong>:20;

<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:23; 2 Peter<strong> 2</strong>:1)


Compare “Redemption”



Camel


Easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter

the kingdom of God (Matthew <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:24 = Mark <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:25 = Luke <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:25)


Capture (see “Warfare Imagery”)


Chicken


A hen gathering her chicks under her wings represents God’s gathering his people under his protection and provision; but like chicks that want to run around and not come under the hen, Jerusalem did not want to accept God’s protection.


Child (see also “Family Relations”)


A child is resilient; he bounces back from adversity very well in comparison to adults.

Children do not bear grudges; they are forgiving.

Jesus set a child in the midst of the disciples as a model of attitude for leadership

(Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:1ff.).

Jesus used the child as an example of humility in being in the kingdom (“except you

enter as a child”; Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:1; <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:14 [= Mark <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:14-15; Luke <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:16-17]).

A child tends to be “innocent,” tends to trust, changes more easily than an adult.

<em>Child</em> is a term of endearment applied to a person’s converts (both τέκνον and υἱός,

<em>teknon</em> and <em>huios</em>; Proverbs <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:11-12 < Hebrews <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:5-8).

Children that do not want to play anything picture the people of Israel that God could

not please no matter what he did (Luke <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:32-35).

Child as a beginner in the study of spiritual things as opposed to an adult (1 Corinthians

<strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:11; cp. “baby,” “milk”)


Discipline of Children


Circumcision


“Circumcision not made with hands”

“Circumcision of the heart”

The idea of purging away what defiles or is filthy

Circumcision as simply trimming/adjusting a small aspect of system of things in

contradiction to a whole new body/creation (Galatians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:15)


Citizenship


Ephesians<strong> 2</strong>:11-19a: belonging


Cleansing


Cleansing is a picture for getting rid of sin (John <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:2).

Ceremonial cleansing (the removal of “taint” in our mind’s eye) is like getting rid of

sin.

See also (“Unclean/Uncleanness”)


Clothes


The body is like clothes that will be changed for another set of clothes (2 Corinthians

<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:2-4).

When we die, we do not become, so to speak, “naked,” but we receive another body.

Nakedness represents the sense of shame (Genesis <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>?; Revelation <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:18).

Nakedness represents having our inner thoughts brought out in the open (Hebrews

<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:13).

Putting on and taking off clothes (changing clothes) serves as a picture for changing

from one way of living to another (Ephesians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:22-24? Colossians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:9-10).

Changing from old clothes to new is a figure for the renewal of the universe (Hebrews

<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:11-12 = Psalm <strong><sup>102</sup></strong>:25-27).


Cloth


A person does not put an unSanforized patch on Sanforized cloth as a way of saying,

<em>“unlike things can’t be mixed”</em> (Matthew <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:16 = Mark <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:21 = Luke <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:36).


Cloud


Clouds without water represent leaders that do not have anything to offer (Jude 12).

These clouds are carried around by the wind, implying they do not have stability to

them (Jude 12).

An immense number (Hebrews <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:1)


(Comforter; see “Advocate”)


Communion (Cross reference to Passover elements that are re-interpreted)


The one loaf and one cup represent the one object of identification–Christ–in contrast

to polytheism and idolatry (2 Corinthians<strong> 10</strong>:14-22).

Eating from the one loaf symbolizes identifying with what it represents (cp. eating from

the Old Testament sacrifices; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:18)

Eating the bread symbolizes eating the flesh of Christ (Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:22; Luke<strong> 22</strong>:19;

Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:23-24).

Drinking grape juice symbolizes drinking His blood (Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:23-25; Luke <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:20;

1 Corinthians<strong> 11</strong>:25-26)


Corner


<em>“Things not being done in a corner”</em> means they were public events (Acts <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:26).


(Cornerstone; see “Building Figures.”)


Covenant/covenant (διαθήκη, <em>diathēkē</em>)


The establishment of a covenant/testament requires death/blood (Hebrews <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:11-22).

The testament does not go into effect until the testator dies (Hebrews<strong> 9</strong>:16-22).


Creation


The idea that man was created in the “image” of God gets extended in Paul and the New Testament from a natural to ethical usage. Being ethical in the image/likeness of God paves the way then for calling our becoming righteous through Christ a “creation” (Ephesians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:10<em>—“created in Christ Jesus for good works”</em>; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:15; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24; <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:24; Galatians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:15; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:17; Colossians<strong> 3</strong>:10).

(Crown; see “Royalty Figures”)


<strong><u>Crucifixion-death-burial-resurrection-ascension of Chris</u></strong><strong>t</strong>


conjointly (Romans <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:4-11ff.)


Crucifixion (Galatians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:20)

“Crucifying the flesh” represents leaving a fleshly orientation of consciousness and

values.

We crucify the world to ourselves when we identify with Christ. Something has to be crucified. The only question is whether it is us, the world or Christ. Crucifixion is a vivid way of amplifying the death figure as a way of speaking of separating ourselves from something (Galatians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:14).

<em>“Let him take up his cross and follow me”</em> is a call to total commitment (Mark<strong> 8</strong>:34;

Matthew <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:38; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:24; Luke <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:23; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:27).

Jesus was crucified outside the Jerusalem gate, which pictures his not being part of

the national Jewish order (Hebrews <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:11-13ff.).

<em>“Nailing Jesus to the cross”</em> is like nailing the Law to the cross (Colossians<strong> 2</strong>:14).

<em>“Re-crucifying Christ”</em> as a common criminal in nakedness is what we do when we reject him/drift away from him later (Hebrews <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:6). It involves the same insensitivity to spiritual things that caused the Jews to kill him before.

Death

As a picture of getting out from under law (Romans <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:1-6; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:4; Galatians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:18-

21; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:1; Colossians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:14)

Burial

As a picture of ceasing to live by flesh-based values (Romans<strong> 6</strong>:1-23)

Resurrection

As a picture of beginning to live by transcendent/spiritual values

Ascension

As a picture of beginning living by transcendent/spiritual values (Colossians

<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:1-11ff.)


Cubit


Not being able to add a cubit to your height is like not being able to change something

by worry/anxiety (Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:25; Matthew <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:27; cp. Psalm <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>:5).


Cup


“Drink a cup” means passing through an ordeal (Matthew <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:22 = Mark <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:38; Matthew <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:39, [42], [44] = Luke <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:42; John <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:11; Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:36; Isaiah<strong> 51</strong>:17; Jeremiah <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>:12).

<em>“Clean the inside of the cup and the outside will be clean, too”</em> (Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:39; Matthew

<strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:25-26).


Cut off


A way of getting rid of something that could ruin the whole self: hand, foot (Mark

<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:43-44; Matthew<strong> 18</strong>:8)


(Darkness; see “Light.”)


Death/dead/die


(See also “Crucifixion-Death-Burial-Resurrection-Ascension of Christ.”)

Run out of spiritual resources for a meaningful existence (John <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:52)


<em>“Put to death”</em> the members/practices/sin (Colossians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:5) means to put

final/permanent closure on not doing them.


Separation

Irrelevancy

Fruitlessness (James <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>)

Insensitivity (Ephesians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:1ff.)


Debtors


The more forgiven the greater the love (Luke<strong> 7</strong>:41-44).


Defilement, ceremonial


Ceremonial defilement is an image for personal defilement (Matthew <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:10-12, 16-20).


Demon


Jesus calls Judas Iscariot a demon because he is going to betray him (John <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:71).


Diaspora/dispersion


Serves as a picture for the temporary nature of the Christian staying in the world and its

essentially alien nature as an environment


See also “Sojourners”


Doctor


A doctor is for the sick, not the well—a principle Jesus used to explain his presence

among 	publicans and sinners (Matthew <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:12 = Mark <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:17 = Luke<strong> 5</strong>:31-32).

<em>“Physician, heal yourself”</em> means what you claim to do for others you ought to be able to do for yourself (Luke<strong> 4</strong>:23; cp. Mark<strong> 15</strong>:29-32; Matthew<strong> 27</strong>:39-44; Luke <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:35-37).


Door


<em>“Shutting the door”</em> means opportunity is over or taken away (Luke <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:25-27; Matthew

<strong><sup>25</sup></strong>:10).

Eating and drinking with someone represents closeness, mutual acceptance (Mark

<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:18; Luke <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:30; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:7; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:26;<strong> 22</strong>:30).

Eating and drinking together implies acceptance (Luke <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:2; Acts <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:41; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:3;

1 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:11).

Eating and drinking means carrying on life normally (Matthew <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:18-19 = Luke<strong> 7</strong>:33-

34; Matthew<strong> 24</strong>:38;<strong> 24</strong>:49; Luke<strong> 12</strong>:45; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:27-28; 1 Corinthians <strong>15:</strong>32).

<em>“Drink a cup”</em> (see “Cup”)

Bread: Jesus’ Bread-of-Life Sermon (John <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:41-65)

Food is essential.

Food applies to everyone.

The person has to put out some effort to have the consequences (nourishment).

Eating is a way of expressing internalizing something (Revelation <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:9-10?; John

<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:51-58).

Food gives us energy and strength.

Emptying


Paul’s figure (κενῶσις, <em>kenōsis</em>) in Philippians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:7 for what Christ did in becoming

man, that is, in taking on the form of a servant


Enter Into


Satan’s entering into someone is a figure for their deciding to do an evil thing (Luke

<strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:3; John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:27).



Epistle


The Corinthians are Paul’s epistle that all people can read (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:1-7ff.).

Their hearts—rather than stone—are what the new covenant is written on

(2 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:1-7ff.).

The Spirit–rather than ink–is what the gospel is written with (2 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:3).


Exaltation/Lifting Up


An expression for valuing or respecting someone/something (Luke <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:15; <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:14; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:11;

Manna (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:3)

The veil on Moses’ Face (2 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:7-11)

The fading glory represents the fading glory of the Law he gave from God

(2 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:7).

The Israelites put a veil on Moses, resembling their not understanding what the

Law was ultimately for (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:13-15).

When a person turns to the Lord Jesus, the veil of mystery is removed regarding

that ultimate purpose of the Law (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16-18).

The law was written on stone tables (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:2-6; cp. Jeremiah <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>:31-34).

The rock in the wilderness (1 Corinthians<strong> 10</strong>:4)

After having saved a people out of Egypt, God destroyed the ones that did not believe

(Jude 5).

God (John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:14, 18; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16, 18; 1 John<strong> 4</strong>:9)

Firstborn implies

a.	Certain privileges and responsibilities

Christ over creation (Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:15; cp. Hebrews <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:6)

Christians (Hebrews <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:23)

b.	More to come

Christ equals firstborn

From the dead (Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:18; Revelation <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:5)

Of many brothers (Romans<strong> 8</strong>:29)

Father-Son

Ministers are compared to parents: 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:14.

Parents/ministers lay up for the children, not children for the parents/ministers

(<strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:14)

*Son-Father

Sonship means being an heir (Galatians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:7).

Sons are freer than slaves (Galatians<strong> 4</strong>:7).

“Children” is an expression for a person’s followers or converts (and perhaps endearment also; John <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:33; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:14-17; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:14; Galatians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:19; Philippians<strong> 2</strong>:15, 22; 1 Thessalonians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11; 1 Timothy<strong> 1</strong>:2, 18).

Offspring of vipers (Psalm <strong><sup>140</sup></strong>:3; Matthew <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:7 = Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:7; Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:34; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:33;

Romans <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:13)

Sons of God (Hosea <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:10; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:26; Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:9, 45; Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:35; John<strong> 1</strong>:12; Romans

<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:14, 16, 19; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:18; Galatians<strong> 3</strong>:26; 1 John<strong> 3</strong>:1-2; Revelation <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:7)

Children of wrath (Ephesians<strong> 2</strong>:3)

Children of God (τέκνον; John<strong> 1</strong>:12; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:52; Romans<strong> 8</strong>:16, 17, 21; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:8; Ephesians

<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:1; Philippians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:15; 1 John<strong> 3</strong>:1, 2, 10;<strong> 5</strong>:2)

Children are fed before the pets/dogs as a figure for representing the idea that Israelites

receive Messiah’s benefits before the Gentiles (Matthew <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:26-27; Mark <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:27-28).

Children become a picture of the ideal person in the kingdom of God (Luke <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:15-17 =

Matthew 1<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:13-15 = Mark<strong> 10</strong>:13-16).

Children inherit from God (Romans <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:16-17).

Children are free in contrast to slaves (Romans <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:21).

Children are expected to obey their parents/God (1 Peter<strong> 1</strong>:14).

Church members are called children (2 John 1, 4, 13).

Child represents what comes from something else (Revelation <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:4, 5).

Parents treat children gently (1 Thessalonians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:7).

Parents encourage children (1 Thessalonians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11).

Family relations serve as a picture of the closeness between Jesus and those who do his Father’s will, whether mother, brothers, sisters (Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:46-50 = Mark<strong> 3</strong>:31-35 = Luke <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:19-21).

“Son” is a term of endearment (Matthew<strong> 9</strong>:2 = Mark<strong> 2</strong>:5).

“Father of something” means the originator of it (John <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:44, “father of lies”).

Discipline of children equals a model for suffering (Revelation <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:19; Proverbs<strong> 3</strong>:5 >

Hebrews<strong> 12</strong>).


Fattening


People who exploit the poor for their own luxuries are fattening themselves up for

slaughter (James<strong> 5</strong>:5).


Feet


Putting something under one’s feet is making it subject to him (Hebrews <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:13 = Acts <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:35; [Matthew <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:44 = Mark<strong> 12</strong>:36 = Luke<strong> 20</strong>:43] < Psalm <strong><sup>110</sup></strong>:1; Psalm <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:6 > Hebrews <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:8-9).


Filling


Being filled with something means being totally characterized by it as when a person is:

Filled with anger (Luke <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:28; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:11).

Filled with the Holy Spirit (Luke <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:15, 41, 67; Acts <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:4; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:10; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:8, 31;<strong> 9</strong>:17; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:9;

Ephesians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:18).

Filled with fear (Luke <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:26).

Filled with leprosy (Luke<strong> 5</strong>:12).

Filled with company (Romans <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:24).

Satan filled the heart of Ananias to lie (Acts <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:3).


*Fire (punishment, destruction, purification, divine presence)


Retrieving an apostate is like snatching something out of the fire; the person who tries it

can himself get burnt (Jude 22).

A little spark of fire can create a large result (cp. the mustard seed; James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:6).

Fire represents purification/refinement (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:12-15; 1 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:7).

Fire represents destruction (Matthew <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:10 + <sup>11</sup>c-12 = Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:9 + 19; Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:22; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:19; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:40-42, 50; <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:8-9;<strong> 25</strong>:41 = Mark <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:43-47; Mark <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:49?; Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16-17;<strong> 9</strong>:54; John <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:6; 2 Thessalonians<strong> 1</strong>:8; Hebrews<strong> 12</strong>:29 > Deuteronomy <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24 = <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:3 = Exodus <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:17; James<strong> 5</strong>:3; Jude 7).

In combination with purification, if something is of good enough quality, fire does not destroy it; it purifies. The same process does both to different parts of the one mix: it destroys the worthless parts (people) and purifies the ones not fully developed.

Fire represents turmoil (James<strong> 3</strong>:5-6).

Fire represents the presence of God.

The burning bush in Exodus (Exodus<strong> 3</strong>:2ff.)

The tongues of fire on Pentecost

The pillar of fire that accompanied the Israelites during the night as they wandered

in the wilderness

The glory of God Moses saw

Compare the Shekinah glory

(See also “Eating,” “Flesh,” “Blood,” “Water,” “Bread,” “Milk.”)

Compare “Body Parts: Feet”


Fruit


“Fruit of the womb” is a way of saying <em>child</em> (Luke<strong> 1</strong>:42).

(See also “Plant Imagery.”)


Fullness


Christ is the whole pleroma of the Gnostic system, so to speak, not just the ruler over one level of the series from the material world to the realm of pure spirit. (See Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:19-20; <em>What the Bible Says About Salvation</em>, 119-20)


(Games; see “Athletic Games.”)

(Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:35; 1 Peter <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:5)


Gladiatorial images


1 Corinthians <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:32


(Grafting; see “Trees.”)


Graves


Hidden graves are compared to hidden evil influences that defile (Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:44).

Whitewashed graves full of dead men’s bones picture good outward appearances and concern for ceremonial cleansing without changing the heart (Matthew <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:25-26; Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:39-41).

<em>“Gates of the grave” </em>(Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:18) pictures the grave as something to be conquered

like a city with huge protective gates.


Hair


The multiplicity of hair represents something yet knowable to God.

The width of a hair represents a very small variance.

Housetop


“<em>Shouting something from the housetop”</em> means making it public.


Image


Paul uses “image” (of God) in an ethical sense, which means that the original nature terminology is being bent into the behavioral sense. In Romans <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:29 the expression is specialized to mean going through the same pattern of suffering before glorification that Christ went through.


In the Old Testament it is used in a natural sense (also in the New Testament at 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:7 and James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:9). That same terminology is adjusted to an ethical usage in Romans <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:29; 2 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:18; and Colossians<strong> 3</strong>:10.

Christ is called the image of God (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24; Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:15).


In

<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:7).

(You receive something that you did not earn)

(Cp. other images for consequences/effects like “reward,” “wages,” “fruit,” “harvest.”)


Jacob’s ladder


Jesus pictures himself as a ladder to heaven with divine messengers ascending and

descending on him (John<strong> 1</strong>:51 < Genesis<strong> 28</strong>:12).


Job

a symbol of patience (James <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:11)

*Jonah


His being swallowed by a great fish for three days pictures Jesus’ three-day burial

followed by resurrection (Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:39-41 = Mark <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:29-30; Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:4).


Jot and tittle


The horns and the Hebrew letter <em>yod</em> ( י ) are small parts of writing that symbolize the tiny aspects of the Law.


Judge


As a person may beg a disinterested judge till he takes his case, so God is much more

susceptible to the prayer of his people in need (Luke <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:1-8).


Keys/binding/loosing (= locking/unlocking?)


“Bound/loosed” means being locked in and held down or prohibited (Job <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:14;

Revelation <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:14; Luke <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:16).

<em>“Taking away the keys”</em> means making something inaccessible (Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:52).

Making something accessible (?): Matthew<strong> 18</strong>:18-20; having access to something that

other people do not have access to.

Determining a conclusion (? Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:18-20)

Enacting legislation on doctrine or practice (? Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:18-20)

Having the keys means having responsibility, control and authority (Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:19;

<strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:18; Revelation<strong> 1</strong>:18;<strong> 3</strong>:7; cp. Isaiah <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:22).


King


God is like a king and his people like a kingdom.


Jesus’ going to heaven to receive a kingdom is like a nobleman going to a far country to

receive a kingdom (Luke<strong> 19</strong>:11-27 = Matthew<strong> 25</strong>:14-30).


Knock (See “Door”; Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:8; Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:9.)


Ladder


Jesus Christ pictured himself in terms of Jacob’s ladder (John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:51; cp. Genesis<strong> 28</strong>:10-

22).


Lay


<em>“Lay hands on”</em>:

To capture someone physically (Matthew<strong> 26</strong>:50 = Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:46; Luke<strong> 20</strong>:19; 21:12;

John<strong> 7</strong>:30, 44; Acts <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:18; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:27)

To appoint (Acts <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:6;<strong> 13</strong>:3; 1 Timothy<strong> 5</strong>:22)

To symbolize healing (Matthew <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:18; Mark <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:23; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:5; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:18; Luke <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:40; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:13;

Acts <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>:8)

To bless (Matthew <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:15)

Leaven


A figure for influence

Matthew<strong> 16</strong>:5-12 = Mark <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:14-21; cp. Luke<strong> 12</strong>:1-3 (evil influence)

Matthew <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:33 = Luke <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:21 (good influence)

A little leaven leavens a whole lump (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:6 = Galatians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:9). (evil

influence)

Old leaven is the previous values, no longer good, that influenced our previous way of

thinking (1 Corinthians<strong> 5</strong>:7, 8).


Life


In Christ is life (John<strong> 1</strong>:4).

Physical life (<em>vs.</em> death) became a symbol for spiritual life (John<strong> 5</strong>:21-26).

Life means meaningful existence.

<em>“Laying down one’s life”</em> means dying for something (John<strong> 10</strong>:11, 15, 17, 18; 1 John

<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:162; John <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:37, 38; Romans <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:4).


Lift


Being lifted up signifies crucifixion (John<strong> 12</strong>:32, 34; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:14; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:28).


Light/darkness


Light (Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:14-16)

Light and darkness are incompatible (2 Corinthians<strong> 6</strong>:14).

Light always immediately dispels darkness (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:6).

Light is self-authenticating.

Light attracts and draws (moths, flies, <em>etc</em>.).

Light stimulates vision; if a person lives continuously in the dark, he will eventually

become blind (cp. 1 John <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11).

Light raises people’s spirits; some people become depressed when they are deprived of light. Seasonal depression/moodiness has been identified as a syndrome that especially bothers some people.

Christ is said to be the effulgence (direct shining) of God’s glory (Hebrews<strong> 1</strong>:3).

<em>“Walking in the light/daytime”</em> means that a person does not stumble (John<strong> 11</strong>:9-10).

The gospel shining in our hearts is like God calling light out of darkness in the

beginning (2 Corinthians<strong> 4</strong>:6).

People do not put a lamp under a bushel basket (Matthew<strong> 5</strong>:15-16; Mark <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:21-22; Luke

<strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:33);

—or under a bed (Luke <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:16);

—or in the cellar (Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:33).

A city set on a hill cannot be hid (the lights of the city? Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:14).

*Light as a symbol for the truth/enlightenment (Matthew<strong> 4</strong>:16; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:14, 16; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:23; Luke <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:32; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:35; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:8; John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:4-5, 7-9;<strong> 3</strong>:19-21;<strong> 5</strong>:35; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:5; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:9-10; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:35-36, 46; Acts <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:47; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:18, 23; 2 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:19).


Darkness as a symbol for:

Ignorance [σκότος] (Matthew <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:16; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:232 [=Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:34-36]; Luke <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:79; Acts <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:18; Romans<strong> 2</strong>:19; I Peter <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:4, 5; [σκοτία] = John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:5; I John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:5;<strong> 1</strong>:8, <sup>9</sup>a, <sup>11</sup>a & c; [σκοτίζομαι] = Romans <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:21; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:10; Ephesians<strong> 4</strong>:18)

Confusion: walking in darkness, a person can get hurt.

Darkness as a symbol for sinfulness/evil [σκότος (Luke <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:53; John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:19; Romans <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:12; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:5; Ephesians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:8, 11;<strong> 6</strong>:12; Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:13; 1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:9; 1 John<strong> 1</strong>:6; [σκοτία] John <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:352, 46; 1 John<strong> 2</strong>:11b)

Darkness as a symbol for hill [σκότος] (Matthew<strong> 8</strong>:12; <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>:30; 2 Peter<strong> 2</strong>:17; Jude

13)

Darkness as a symbol for privacy (Matthew<strong> 10</strong>:27; Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:3)

Churches/people are called lampstands (“candlesticks”; Philippians<strong> 2</strong>:15; Revelation

<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:12-13; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:5.).

Light does not come from nowhere; it begins at a source and connects to another point. Christ 	is the source of light and Christians are at least reflectors of that light to connect it with people who work in the dark. It has no effect unless it leaves its source and “touches” some object. It is different from the rest of what is.


Lightning


Divine destruction

Lightning cracking to the earth represents Satan’s fall (Luke<strong> 10</strong>:18).

As lightning flashes all the way across the sky, so will the coming of Christ be

(Matthew <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:27 = Luke <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:24).


Loins (*Girding up the loins)


Preparation/readiness for action (Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:35; Ephesians<strong> 6</strong>:14; 1 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:13 < Exodus

<strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:11; 1 Kings <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:46; 2 Kings <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:29; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:1; Jeremiah <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:17)


Lord’s Supper, The (See “Communion.”)


*Manna (See also “Bread.”)


Physical sustenance in the wilderness becomes an image for spiritual sustenance in the

material world (John <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:31-35, 41, 48-58; Revelation <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:17).


Marriage (See also “Weddings.”)


The church is the bride of Christ (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:2; Ephesians<strong> 5</strong>:22-33).

*Adultery is a symbol of unfaithfulness or mixing irreconcilable commitments

(Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:39; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:4; Mark <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:38; James <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:4; Revelation <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:22).


Meal


People will return your grace like meal pressed down, shaken together and running over

(Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:38; cp. Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:2; Mark <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:24).


Meat (See “Food.”)


Melchizedek


Genesis <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:18-20 + (cp. Zechariah<strong> 6</strong>:13) + Psalm<strong> 110</strong>:4; Hebrews<strong> 5</strong>:6, 10 +<strong> 6</strong>:20<strong>-8</strong>:6

without mother or father (as far as the record goes;<strong> 7</strong>:3)

without birth or death (as far as the record goes; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:3); cp. virgin birth and resurrection over death to serve continuously as priest (<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:23-24); hence, one priest rather than a series of priests (<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:23-25)

greater than Abraham because Abraham paid tithes to him from the spoils of war

(<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:4-8)

King of righteousness (“Melchizedek”; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:2)

King of peace (“Salem”;<strong> 7</strong>:2)

Messiah as High-priest-King

A different priesthood from that of Levi-Aaron (<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:9); hence, the change of

law/covenant (<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:12ff.), it being a better covenant/place of officiating (<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:4, 7), and so on.


Men


A full-grown man in contrast to a baby or a child represents someone who has matured in the faith rather than someone who is still working only with the first level of doctrinal matters (Hebrews <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:14; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:11; cp. 1 Peter<strong> 2</strong>:2).

Millstone


Putting a millstone around a person’s neck and throwing him into the ocean is a picture

of inescapable destiny (Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:6; Mark <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:42; Luke <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:2).


Milk


Preliminary Christian teachings in contrast to solid food (Hebrews <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:12-14;

1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:2; 1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:20).


Mirror


The word is like a mirror that allows us to see what we look like (James<strong> 1</strong>:23-25).


Mote


A picture of weakness or small negative influence (Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:3-5; Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:41-42)


Mountain


Moving a mountain as a statement of great effect (Matthew <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:20; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:21; Mark <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:23;

1 Corinthians<strong> 13</strong>:2)


Naaman


There were many lepers in Israel in the days of Elisha the prophet, but none were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian, which illustrates God’s concern for more than just Israel.


(Nakedness; see “Clothes.”)


<strong><u>National imagery</u></strong>


King/Lord/Prince/Governor


Serves as an image for Jesus Christ as head of the church


Naturalization

A picture of being brought into what is not naturally yours. This is a particularly apt expression because God’s nation Israel serves as a picture of the group of God’s people the church.


Needle


<em>“Easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye . . .”</em> (Matthew <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:24 = Mark <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:25 =

Luke <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:25)


(New creation; see “Re-creation.”)


(Nobleman; see “King.”)

Offerings


Paul says his life is <em>“poured out like a drink offering”</em>—a kind of emptying (2 Timothy

<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:6).


Opening


An opportunity made available is an open door (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:9; 2 Corinthians

<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:12; Colossians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3; Revelation <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:7, 8).

Explaining something: opening the scripture (Luke <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>4)

Opening the eyes (see “Eyes”)

<em>“Opening the mind” </em>means causing to understand (Luke <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:32, 45).

Miscellaneous (Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:8 = Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:9)


(Pain; see “Suffering.”)


(Paraclete; see “Advocate.”)


(Pastor; see “Shepherd.”)


Pigs


Represent uncleanness

What cannot appreciate valuable things

<em>“Casting pearls before swine”</em> is an image for giving important things to people who cannot appreciate their value and who disregard them and even turn on you to harm you.


(Pilgrims; see “Sojourners.”)

<strong><u>Plant imagery </u></strong>


Vine and the branches (John <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:1-8ff)

Old Testament references where Israel is called a vine.

Pruning represents getting rid of what hinders productivity: <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:2.

Christ is the vine; the disciples are the branches; the Father is the husbandman

(<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:1, 5).

The branches have to stay on the vine to bear fruit (<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:4-8ff.).

If the branches leave the vine, they wither.

If the branches are cut out of the vine, they are thrown into the fire and destroyed

(<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:6).

There is no value to a branch if it does not bear fruit.

Sowing/seed as expressions for cause (cp. “Fruit” for “result”)

Fruit* as a word for result or product (cp. “Seed” for cause; Matthew<strong> 3</strong>:8 = Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:8; Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:16-20; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:33; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:8, 26;<strong> 21</strong>:18-22 = Mark <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:12-14, 2-24, 33-43; Mark <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:16-20; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:23; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:20; Luke <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:15; Romans<strong> 1</strong>:13; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:21-22; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:4-5; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:28; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:5; Galatians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:22-24; Ephesians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:9; Philippians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:11, 22;<strong> 4</strong>:17; Colossians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:6, 10; 2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:6; Hebrews <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:11; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:15; James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:17-18; Jude 12)

Plants that God has not planted will be uprooted (Matthew <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:13; cp. Isaiah <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>:21;

<strong><sup>60</sup></strong>:3).

Putting Israel in Palestine is called planting them (Isaiah <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>:21;<strong> 63</strong>:3).

(See also “Sowing-Reaping Imagery.”)

(See also “Trees.”)

(See also “Seed.”)


Poison


Hurtful words that come from a person’s mouth like poison from a snake’s mouth (James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:8; Romans <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:13 < Psalm <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>:4; <strong><sup>140</sup></strong>:3)


<strong><u>Political imagery</u></strong> (See also “Royalty Imagery.”)


The judicial processes serve to illustrate how inevitable consequences are if we do not

take care of the problem when it comes along (Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:23-26; Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:57-59).

Fines and imprisonment represent consequences.


Pottery


Isaiah <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>:9 + Jeremiah <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:1-8ff. < Romans <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:19-23; 2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:20-21

God’s messengers of the gospel are like clay pots that carry priceless treasure.


Priest/High Priest


Hebrews<strong> 4</strong>:14-5:10 +<strong> 6</strong>:19-8:6


Publican


Someone outside the group (Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:17)

A humble publican that recognizes his sin is better off than a righteous Pharisee (Luke

<strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:9-14).


(Queen of Sheba; see “Solomon.”)


Ransom


A picture of Christ’s atonement (Matthew <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:28 = Mark <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:45; Luke <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:68; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:38; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:21;

1 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:6; Titus <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:14; 1 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:18; Hebrews <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:12)

Re-creation


A totally new person or complete overhaul <em>vs</em>. circumcision, which simply trims an

existing system; cp. new birth, resurrection, new wineskin


Redemption


Reed


Jesus’ non-condemnation/gentleness is pictured as not breaking a bruised reed

(Matthew<strong> 12</strong>:20).

Instability is pictured by a reed blown in the wind (Matthew <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:7 = Luke <strong>7:</strong>24).


<strong><u>Refuse/off-scouring/filth</u></strong>


1 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:13


“Respect of persons”


Preferential treatment

Regarding slave <em>vs.</em> master (Colossians<strong> 3</strong>:25; Ephesians<strong> 6</strong>:9)

Jew <em>vs.</em> Gentile (Acts <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:34-35)

Rich <em>vs.</em> poor (James<strong> 2</strong>:1, 3, 9)

Fame/rank (Galatians<strong> 2</strong>:6)

Because of bribes (Deuteronomy <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:17-18; 2 Chronicles <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:7)

General (1 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:17)

(See also Ecclesiastes<strong> 4</strong>:27; 1 Esdras <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:39.)


Resurrection


A picture of giving spiritual life to people (John<strong> 5</strong>:21)


(Road<strong>; </strong>see “Way.”)


Robbery


Paul calls it “robbery” to take support from other churches in ministering elsewhere

(2 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:8).

Jesus calls previous messianic claimants “robbers” (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:1, 8).

Christ’s being equal with God was not robbery (Philippians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:6).

A robber’s coming represents unexpected events (Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:43-44; Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:39-40).


Rock


(See “Foundation Figures/Building Figures.”)


Rod


Rulership

Discipline


<strong><u>Royalty figures</u></strong>


Crown (2 Timothy <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:8)


Running


Diligently carrying on the process of life (Galatians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:5)


Sacrifice


Picture of the atonement

Poured out a drink offering (2 Timothy<strong> 4</strong>:6)


Salt


Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:13; Mark <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:49

If salt loses its saltiness, there is nothing else you can use to make it salty again.

If salt loses its saltiness, it is useless except perhaps as pavement for a path.

(Salt seasons food; it is what makes food/life tasty/meaningful; it improves the

flavor.)

(Salt is made up of two chemicals that separately are deadly poisons. When we dogmatically overemphasize one part of the faith, we make Christianity fatal.)

(Salt can be used to put out fires; in former times when a chimney would get on fire from wood burning, <em>etc</em>., a person would go up on the roof and pour salt down the chimney to put out the fire.)

(Salt can be used as a preservative; it prevents or retards putrefaction.)

(Salt sterilizes and purifies; no gargle is better than salt-water gargle.)

(Salt is a healing agent.)

(Salt is essential to life; it keeps people alive and healthy.)

(Salt has the ability to permeate.)

(Salt is not affected by age, moisture, temperature, or time; it has no expiration

date.)

(Salt can lose its flavor only by being polluted or diluted.)

(Salt creates thirst and hunger. I bet you can’t eat just one.)

(Salt melts ice.); when people are cold or the love of many grows cold, Christians

have the responsibility of “melting” that insensitivity.

(Not a lot of salt is needed to do its work.)

(Salt can be used in heavy water solution to unplug drains.)

(In water solution or vaporized salt-water solution salt can be used as a nasal

decongestant.)

Having salt in yourself becomes a picture for internal source of flavoring and worth/meaning <em>vs.</em> being like food that gets its flavoring from something else (Matthew <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:50).

Being the salt of the world implies that if Christians lose their saltiness, there is no way to make them salty because there is no other source of saltiness than salt itself.


Salvation


An image for reconciliation to God


Samaritan


A person outside the group (cp. Gentile, publican)


Sandals


John the Baptist compared the superiority of Messiah over himself to his own unworthiness to undo Messiah’s sandal straps (Mark <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:7 = Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16 = John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:27)* or carry his sandals (Matthew<strong> 3</strong>:11).


Satan (NT)


In general, Satan stands for the whole system of things alternative to Christ (Luke

<strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:18; Matthew<strong> 12</strong>:26 = Mark <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:23, 26 = Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:18; Acts<strong> 26</strong>:16).

Jesus called Peter “Satan” when he did as Satan did (Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:23 = Mark<strong> 8</strong>:3).

Satan entering into someone represents that person’s deciding to do something that corresponds with Satan’s will (John <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:27 = Luke <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:3; Acts <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:3); cp. the “devil” entering the heart of someone (John <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:2).

Excommunicating someone from the fellowship is called “delivering to Satan”		(1 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:5; 1 Timothy <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:20).

Turning away from Christ is called <em>“turning to Satan”</em> (1 Timothy<strong> 5</strong>:15).

What works against Christ is said to be Satan’s working against Christ (1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:18;

2 Peter<strong> 2</strong>:9).

The identity alternate to Christ (Revelation <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:9, 132, 24; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:9).

Evil experiences/operations are called Satan’s operation (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11;

1 Corinthians <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:5; Luke 1<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16).

(Satan is put directly for his indirect operations.)


(Schoolmaster; see “Tutor.”)


<strong><u>Seafaring imagery</u></strong>


Shipwreck concerning the faith (1 Timothy<strong> 1</strong>:19)

Christ is our anchor for the soul (Hebrews<strong> 6</strong>:19).


The tongue is like the rudder of a ship, which is very small compared to a ship in

storm-driven seas; yet it is used to direct the ship (cp. bridle, spark; James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:4).

Wild waves of the sea that foam up shame (Jude13)


Seal


The converts in Corinth are the seal of Paul’s apostleship. (2 Corinthians<strong> 9</strong>:2; see also

2 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:2, where they are called Paul’s “epistle.”)

Represents a statement of approval (John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:33)


Seed


Mustard seed especially emphasizes the small beginning that leads to a large result

(Matthew<strong> 13</strong>:312 = Mark<strong> 4</strong>:30-32 = Luke<strong> 13</strong>:18-19; Matthew <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:20 = Luke <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:6).


(Serpents; see “Vipers.”)


Servant


See also “slave.”

Is “Servant of the Lord” an analogy to Jesus or a prediction of Jesus (cp. Hagar-Sarah,

First-Second Adam, Jonah, temple, <em>etc</em>.)?


<strong><u>Shepherd/pastor-sheep</u></strong>


Lambs among wolves represents innocent/harmless people among dangerous ones

(Luke <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:3; Matthew <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:16).

A label for the leadership/eldership/apostleship in the church (John <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:15-17;<strong> 20</strong>:28-29;

Ephesians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:11; Acts <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:28-30).

Three roles come off the shepherd image

1.	Feeding

2.	Ruling

3.	Protecting (Acts<strong> 20</strong>:29)

Leaders teaching is like shepherds feeding sheep (John <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:15-17).

Christ is the Lamb of God (John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:29, 36; Acts <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:32; 1 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:19, no spot or blemish).

Flock/sheep as a label for the followers of Jesus (Luke<strong> 12</strong>:32)

Sheep are highly dependent animals; they have no way to defend themselves against predators.

If sheep get lost, the shepherd has the responsibility of going after them; ministers have a responsibility for taking the initiative in going after Christians who stray from the group/flock.

Sheep will not follow someone besides their own shepherd; they recognize his voice over other voices (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:5, 14; cp. 16, 27).

<em>“I am a good shepherd”</em> (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:7-18); Christ is the chief shepherd (1 Peter <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:4; cp.

Psalm <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>).

A shepherd is different from a thief:

He goes in at the door rather than climb in some other way (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:1).

A shepherd is different from a hireling:

He does not run when he sees wolf coming, but protects the flock—he lays

down his life in so doing (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:11b-13).

He cares for the sheep (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:13;<strong> 21</strong>:15-17).

He knows his sheep; even though sheep look a lot alike, the person that is

around them all the time can tell them apart (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:14).

A shepherd is different from a wolf.

He does not scatter them (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:12).

He does not snatch them to harm them (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:12).

There are other sheep that Jesus wants to bring into one flock (John <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:16).

The one who feeds a flock drinks the milk from the flock, illustrating the idea that those

who minister to the church are supported by the believers (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:7c).

False shepherds use the flock to feed themselves, comparable to leaders that see the

church as a place to benefit themselves (Jude 12).

As killing the shepherd scatters the sheep, so killing Jesus disperses his disciples

(Matthew <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:31 = Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:27 < Zechariah <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:7; John <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:32).

Going out and looking for the lost minority while leaving the majority in safety represents the idea that there is greater joy over conversion than continued goodness (Luke <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:3-7 = Matthew<strong> 18</strong>:12-14).

Disoriented, confused people are like sheep without a shepherd (Matthew 9:36; Mark

<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:34; Numbers <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>:17; Ezekiel <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>:5; Zachariah <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:2; 1 Kings <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:17).

Christ was not sent to the Gentiles in his first coming, but only to the lost sheep of the

house of Israel (Matthew <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:24; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:5-6).


Sickness


Spiritually weak (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:30)


*Sifting


A picture for putting someone through trials (Luke <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:31; Amos <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:9; Isaiah <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>:28)


Sight/blindness


Physical blindness is compared to spiritual blindness (John <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:35-41; note context of the

healing of the man born blind). (“To see” means “to understand.”)

Being cross-eyed is like trying to operate by two frames of reference (Matthew <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:22-

23).

Being in the dark so long that they cannot see anymore (1 John <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:11)

Blind leading the blind are like teachers that do not know what they are talking about

(Matthew <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:14; Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:39).

(See also “Eyes.”)


Sky (See also “Weather.”)


Slave/slavery


Irresponsible slaves were scourged in proportion to their irresponsibility (Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:46-

48).

Romans <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:1; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:5; Philippians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:1; 2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:24; Titus <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:1

Parable of the Unmerciful Servant (Matthew <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:23-25)

A follower of Jesus Christ turns over everything to the master.

A slave cannot serve two masters (Matthew <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:24; Luke <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:13).

Judaizers were, so to speak, making slaves out of the Gentiles (Galatians<strong> 2</strong>:4).

Being under law is like being in slavery (Galatians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3, 9;<strong> 5</strong>:1).

Aggressive, pushy, overbearing, presumptuous people make slaves out of other people

(2 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:10).

John the Baptist did not consider himself worthy to carry Jesus’ shoes (Matthew<strong> 3</strong>:11).

John the Baptist did not consider himself worthy to untie Jesus’ sandals for him (Luke

<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16; John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:27).

Someone addicted to sin or in the sin state is pictured as a slave to sin (John <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:32-36).

A servant who is faithful while his master is not around is like a disciple of Jesus faithful at the time of Christ’s unpredictable return (Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:42-51 = Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:41-48).

(See also “Stewards.”)

A steward to be relieved of his stewardship might make preparations for the future as

the unrighteous steward did (Luke <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:1-13).

A slave’s work is first for the master and then for himself (Luke <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:7-10).

A slave can never do enough; he has to take the attitude that he is unprofitable no

matter what (Luke<strong> 17</strong>:7-10).

What a slave is given to work with does not belong to him, but to his master and what

he produces more also belongs to the master (Luke <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:11-27). (cp. “Stewards”)

Servants are supposed to be responsible while the master is gone (Luke <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:11-27; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:9-

18).


Sleep


(See essay on “Soul-Sleeping.”)

As a picture for death (1 Kings <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:10; Daniel <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:2; Matthew <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>:52; [Mark <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:39?]; Mark <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:33-37; John<strong> 11</strong>:11-14; Acts<strong> 7</strong>:60; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:36; 1 Corinthians<strong> 15</strong>:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Peter <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:13-18; 2 Peter <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:4)

There is no movement; the person is not accomplishing anything—he is “resting.”

The eyes are shut.

The person is in a prone position.

The person is unaware of what is going on around him.

Lost condition(?): 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:30 (“and not a few are asleep”)


(Snakes; see “Vipers.”)


Sojourners


A picture of the temporary and essentially foreign nature of the world’s environment for

Christian people (1 Peter<strong> 2</strong>:11)

(See also “Diaspora/Dispersion.”)


(Soldier; see “Warfare Imagery.”)


Solomon


Jesus is greater than Solomon, whom the Queen of Sheba/the South came to see (Matthew <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:42; Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:31). Jesus uses this example along with that of Naaman and the widow of Sarepta/Zarephath to illustrate God’s concern for more than just the Jews.


<strong><u>Sowing-reaping/seed</u></strong>


The law of harvest: you reap what you sow (Galatians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:7-8; cp. Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:16-20;

<strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:33; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:43-44; Luke<strong> 6</strong>:43-45; James<strong> 3</strong>:12).

Harvesting is like converting people (Luke <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:2).

“Preaching the Word” is like sowing seed and “hearing it and taking it to heart” is like

having 	it planted in you (James <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:21).

The seed and its plant is compared to resurrection (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:35-38).

The seed itself has to cease existing before the plant can become.

The thing sown differs from what comes from it.

A seed has to “die” to produce the plant.

A person has to give up autonomous identity in order to amount to anything for

God: John <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:24-25.

Parable of the Sower (Matthew <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:3-23; Mark <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3-20)

Different kinds of soil represent different degrees of readiness to accept the word and different levels of productivity from it. Shallow (rocky) soil represents short-lived enthusiasm for the gospel, but it does not last because the wheat does not have enough root to keep it from being scorched by the hot sun. Hard soil represents the disinterested. Birds represent other influences that remove the word from the situation. Thorny soil represents good potential that is choked out by distracting interests. Good soil produces different amounts.

Parable of the Tares

Weed seeds (or briars) grow also among the blades of wheat because they have been planted in the soil by contrary influences in the field (enemies of the landowner).

Good and evil people grow together until the harvest, which occurs at the end.

Good and evil are not separated during the growing season because their intertwined roots mean that any effort to extract the weeds now would end up destroying some of the wheat in the process.


The field represents the world.

Angels are the reapers.

The good seed are sons of the kingdom.

The bad seed are sons of the evil one.

The enemy is the devil.

The harvest is the end of the world.

The tares are gathered up at the end and burned (Matthew<strong> 13</strong>:40-42).

Parable of Sowing-Reaping (Mark <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:26-28)

Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matthew <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:31-32; Mark <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:30-32; Luke<strong> 13</strong>:18-19)

From something very small comes something comparatively large.

Firstfruits (Romans <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:16; 1<strong>6:</strong>5; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:15)

(Serves as a picture for many situations where one example will be followed by many more and serve as the epitome for the rest) (Cp. “firstborn.”)

1.	Christian converts are firstfruits from among people (James <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:18).

Similarly, the household of Stephanus was the firstfruits of Achaia

(1 Corinthians <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:15), and Epaenetus was the firstfruits of Asia (Romans<strong> 16</strong>:5).

2.	“Firstfruits” conveys a sense of specialness and especially valued (Revelation <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:4) speaks of the saved as firstfruits without implying necessarily that the rest will also be saved.

3.	Christ is the firstfruits of resurrection (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:20, 23).

4.	The Spirit is the firstfruits of salvation in anticipation of the redemption of the body at the resurrection (Romans <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:23; cp. the Holy Spirit as an “earnest” in Ephesians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:14).

The one who sows eats some of the produce from the harvest, illustrating supporting those who minister to the believers (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:10-11ff.). Not muzzling the ox while threshing represents living on the basis of your work.

The one who threshes eats some of what he produces, illustrating supporting those

who minister to the believers (2 Corinthians<strong> 9</strong>:10-11ff.).

Various ones contribute different activities to the planting-reaping process.

Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the increase (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:6-8).

God is the most important because he gives the increase (1 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:7).

People are paid according to their labor (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:8).

Jesus was sending his apostles to reap that on which they had not bestowed any

labor (John<strong> 4</strong>:38).

<em>“White unto harvest”</em> symbolizes readiness to hear the gospel (John <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:35).

Wages are paid to those who labor in the harvest. (Harvesting is not just to protect the

grain or get God’s work done)

Land that grows briars and thistles instead of the crops it was sown to bear will be burned off, symbolizing the trials, sufferings, punishments that come to those disobedient to the message they have received (Hebrews <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:7-8).

Threshing with oxen on a threshing floor

The chaff represents worthless material that is unstable (the wind can be used to

blow it away); winnowing (Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:17 = Matthew <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:12).

Large harvest needs lots of laborers; many people to be converted need many workers

in the kingdom and there are so few of them (Matthew <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:37-38).

See also “Plant Imagery” and “Trees.”

Mustard-seed parable (Luke <strong>13:</strong>18-19 = Matthew <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:31-32 = Mark<strong> 4</strong>:30-32). The

mustard seed illustrates a large consequence from a small cause.


(Speck; see “Mote.”)


Stars


Wandering stars (Jude 13)


Stone


A stone’s throw becomes a loose measure of distance (Luke <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:41).

(See also “Building Figures.”)


Stumbling


Means to be/cause a problem (Matthew <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:29;<strong> 11</strong>:6; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:21, 57; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:10; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:31; Mark <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:3;

John<strong> 6</strong>:61; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:1)

Sinning is like stumbling; it “trips you up” (James <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:10).

Stumbling represents a minor incident that brings up a problem for someone. The angels would take care of the Messiah to the extent that they would catch him in such cases so he would not fall (Psalm<strong> 91</strong>:12 < Luke <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:11 = Matthew<strong> 4</strong>:6).

Stumbling can mean to get someone confused or cause them to doubt and perhaps act

accordingly (John <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:1).

Stumbling can contrast with falling down completely (Romans <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:11).


Stumbling block


Psalm <strong><u><sup>59</sup></u></strong>:22; Isaiah <strong><u><sup>28</sup></u></strong>:16; John <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:9-10; Romans <strong><u><sup>9</sup></u></strong>:32-33; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:9, 11; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:13, 21; 1 Corinthians <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:23;<strong> 8</strong>:9, 13; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:32; Galatians<strong> 5</strong>:11; 1 Peter<strong><u> 2</u></strong>:6, 8; Jude 24; Revelation <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:14

Something that throws people “off the track”

Messiah proved to be a stumbling block to the Jews (Isaiah<strong> 8</strong>:14; Romans <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:32-33;

1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:8; cp. Jeremiah <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:21).


Suffering


**Weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:42, 50; <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:51; <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>:30; Luke

<strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:28)

Woman in travail

Gnawing their tongues for pain (Revelation <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:10)


Sword


Represents turmoil and division (Matthew10:34)


<strong><u>Tabernacle/temple</u></strong>


The veil in the tabernacle signified that the way into the true Holy of Holies was not yet

made known while the first tabernacle was still standing (Hebrews <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:6-10).

The wall between the Court of the Men of Israel and the Court of the Gentiles

represents a separation that has been torn down in Christ (Ephesians<strong> 2</strong>:14).

Our bodies are tabernacles of the self (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:1; 2 Peter <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:13-14).

Our bodies are tabernacles of the Spirit (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:19; John <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:19-22; Mark

<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:58).

The body of Jesus is a functional equivalent for the Jerusalem temple (John<strong> 2</strong>:19-22).

Tearing it down and rebuilding it became an image for getting rid of the old system and

replacing it with a new one.

Changing over from the Old Covenant to the New is pictured as destroying the temple (and rebuilding it in three days; Matthew <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:61 = Mark <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:58; Matthew<strong> 27</strong>:40 = Mark <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:29; John <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:19-22; Acts <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:14).


*Taste


Acute experience

taste of death (Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:28; Mark <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:1; Luke <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:27; John <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:52; Hebrews <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:9)

benefits of salvation (Hebrews<strong> 6</strong>:4-5; 1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:3)


<strong><u>Temperature imagery</u></strong>


Lukewarmness represents unsavory taste (Revelation <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:15-16).

Coldness is a loss of a characteristic like love (Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:12).


(Testament; see “Covenant.”)


(Thief; see “Robbery.”)


<strong><u>Thorns</u></strong>


“Thorn in the flesh” (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:5-10)


(Threshing; see “Sowing-Reaping/Harvesting-Seed.”)


Tomb


(See also “Graves.”)


<em>“Whitewashed tombs”</em> represent outer appearance of goodness with inner evil.

<em>“Hidden tombs”</em> represent hidden sources of defilement (Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:44).


Touch

A euphemism for sexual intercourse (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:1)


Trap


2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:26; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:20; James <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:14 (temptation traps you)


Travail


John <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:21

The beginning of good things is often in pain.

The subsequent joy overshadows the previous pain.

Unescapable coming things


<strong><u>Travel imagery</u></strong>


Gates (Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:13-14)

Wide and narrow path (Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:13-14)

Walking* as an image for living life, conducting oneself (Mark <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:15; Luke<strong> 1</strong>:6; John <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:66; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:9-10; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:35; Acts <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:31; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:16; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:21, 24; Romans <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:4; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:1, 6; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:15; 1 Corinthians<strong> 3</strong>:3; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:17; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:7; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:2-3; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:18; Galatians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:14; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:6, 25; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:16; Ephesians <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:2, 10; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:1, 17; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:2, 8, 15; Philippians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:16-18; Colossians<strong> 1</strong>:10; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:6; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:7; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:5; 1 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:1, 12; 2 Peter <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:6, 11; 1 Peter<strong> 4</strong>:3; 2 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:10; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:3; 1 John<strong> 1</strong>:6-7; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:6, 11; 2 John 4, 62; 3 John <strong>3-4</strong>; Jude 16, 18)

Leading

Following


Treading


“To be tread on” or <em>“trodden down”</em> means <em>“to be run over”</em> (Luke<strong> 21</strong>:24; Revelation

<strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:2).


Treasure


A householder brings out of his treasure things new and old (Matthew<strong> 13</strong>:51-52).

Bringing things out of one’s treasure is like the mouth speaking out of the things stored

in the heart (Matthew<strong> 12</strong>:35).

The gospel is a treasure, as Paul says, carried in clay pots, God’s messengers (2

Corinthians<strong> 4</strong>:7).

The contrast between the value of the contents and the value of the containers

(2 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:7)

The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price (Matthew <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:45-46)

A person ought to sell everything lesser that he has in order to get this one treasure.

The Parable of the Treasure in a Field (Matthew <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:44)

“Laying up treasure” means putting your concerns in something or relying on something

(Matthew<strong> 6</strong>:19-21; Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:33-34; <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:22).

Earthly treasure deteriorates/rusts; thieves steal it; moths ruin it; heavenly treasure

does not have these weaknesses.

Where your treasure is your heart will also be; that is, where you put what you consider important (mental activity) is where your affections will be centered (emotions; Matthew<strong> 6</strong>: ?; Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:34).


Tree


Being under one’s fig tree or eating from one’s fig tree refers to a situation of stability,

peace (Micah <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:4; 1 Kings<strong> 4</strong>:25; Zechariah <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:10; 2 Kings <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:31; Isaiah <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>:16).

Romans<strong> 11</strong>:16b-24: The Olive Tree

Wild branches have been grafted into the Abrahamic olive tree.

If the branches wild or natural do not bear fruit, they will be trimmed out of the tree.

Gentiles are to see themselves as brought into the Abrahamic tree because its root

nourishes the branches; the branches do not nourish the root.

Trees that do not bear fruit are cut down and thrown into the fire (Matthew <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:10 = Luke

<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:9).

Fruitless trees (Jude 12), blown over by the wind and uprooted, represent false leaders.

The measure of a good or bad fruit tree is only whether it has good or bad fruit, not whether it is pretty (as a decorative tree might be, or goodness on the basis of Abraham’s origin; Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:17-18 = Luke<strong> 6</strong>:45; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:33 = Luke <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:43-44, particularly). It is not what they look like or sound like; those are things that “don’t count.”

The cursing of the fig tree was evidently an object lesson about fruitlessness despite a “show” of fruitfulness (by putting out leaves; Matthew <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:18-20 = Mark<strong> 11</strong>:12-14, 20-21).

A fig tree puts out leaves before summer; hence, its leaves become a way of predicting

the future—the near future at least (Mark <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:28-30; Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:32; Luke <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:30).

As a fig tree loses its fruit in a storm, so will the elements be moved in the end times

(Revelation <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:13; cp. Isaiah <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>:4).

Laying an ax at the foot of a tree represents impending destruction.

Green tree represents a time of relative prosperity (<em>vs.</em> dry? Luke <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>:31)


Tutor


Galatians <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:24-25


<strong><u>Unclean/uncleanness</u></strong>


a.	Sickness,   b. Sin,  c. Ceremonial defilement,  d. Dirty


Applied to “evil” spirits (demons; Matthew <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:1; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:43; Mark <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:23, 26, 27;<strong> 3</strong>:11, 30; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:2, 8, 13;<strong> 6</strong>:7; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:25; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:25; Luke <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:33, 36; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:18; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:29; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:42; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:24; Acts <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:16; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:7; Revelation <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:13; 18:2)

Illegitimate children (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:14)

Ceremonially defiled (Acts <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:14, 28; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:8; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:17)

Filthy acting person (Ephesians<strong> 5</strong>:5?)

Sickness like leprosy (Luke <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:12-14)


Vapor/Steam/Mist


Vapor represents transitoriness (James <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:14)

Mists driven by the wind represents instability (2 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:17)


*Vessel


The body is a vessel (1 Peter<strong> 4</strong>:4).

The human person is a vessel (of divine service; Acts <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:15; 2 Corinthians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:7;

2 Timothy<strong> 2</strong>:20; 1 Peter <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:7).


(Vine; see “Plant Imagery”)


Vineyard


Evil behavior (Romans <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:24; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:19)

Parable of Laborers in a Vineyard (Matthew <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:1-16)

Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen (Matthew <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:33-46; Mark <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:1-12; Luke <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>:9-19)

The one that plants a vineyard eats from the fruit of it (1 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:7b, 8-10ff.).

Patience is needed for the result (conclusion of the matter) even as a husbandman has to

wait a long time for the harvest (James <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:7)

Parable of the Two Sons (Matthew<strong> 21</strong>:28-32)

Workers in a vineyard complement each other’s work of ministry. They work together

for the same project; hence, a comment against division.

God is the most prominent member in this effort; the ministers take no credit for the

results any more than a gardener causes plants to grow.


Vipers


Represent wisdom (Matthew <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>:16)

(See also “Sons/Offspring of Vipers” and “Family Relations Imagery.”)


Vultures


As they are gathered around a carcass, so will the center of attention be at Christ’s

coming (Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:28).


Wages


Wages stand for the consequences of actions.

<em>“The wages of sin is death”</em> (Romans <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:23; cp. 2 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:15).

Support for ministry is called “wages” (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:8).

John <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:36



Walk


Conduct of life. Walking is something that a person continuously does; especially would this have been the case in the ancient world. Furthermore, walking is an image that corresponds with way or path. Way is a typical picture for a pattern of belief or living. Walking the way refers then to the active conduct of life according to such a pattern.


<strong><u>Warfare imagery</u></strong>


*War of words (2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:14 [λογομαχέω, <em>logomacheō</em>, a once-used word];

1 Timothy <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:4 [λογομαχία, a once-used word])

Armor (Ephesians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:10-20; 1 Peter <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:8 < Wisdom <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:17ff.).

Soldier (2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:3-4)

Soldiers do not get entangled in the affairs of public life (2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:4).

Soldiers do not serve at their own expense (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:7a).

Being captured by Satan (2 Timothy <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:26; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:6)

Lording it over people—or, bringing them under law—is like capturing them

(2 Corinthians<strong> 11</strong>:10).

Considering ahead of time whether you have the strength to wage this war (Luke <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:31-

32)


Water


John <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:10-15

Water as a symbol for the word

a) a “life-giving” message

b) quenches thirst

Water as a symbol for the Holy Spirit (John <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:38-39)

Water as a symbol for cleansing/purification

Water as a symbol for life-giving resource

Water as a symbol for vast numbers of people (Revelation)


Way/Road


A way/road represents a way of life.

*The Way became a term for early Christianity: Acts <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:2; <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>:9, 23; <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:4;<strong> 24</strong>:14, 22

Preparing the road for someone means getting ready for him (Malachi <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:1; Isaiah <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>:3-

5 < Matthew <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:3 = Mark <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:2-3 = Luke <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:4-6 = John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:23).


Weather


We use the way the sky looks as a way of predicting the weather; so also we use the

way things are going as a way to project the future (Matthew <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:2-4; Luke <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:54-56).

Boanerges: Jesus nicknamed James and John “Sons of Thunder” because of their

temperament (? Mark<strong> 3</strong>:16; cp. Luke <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:54; Mark <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:38).

Weddings


Parable of the Ten Virgins

The sons of the bridegroom cannot be sad (hence, fast) while the bridegroom is around

(Matthew<strong> 9</strong>:14-16 = Mark <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:18-20 = Luke <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:33-35).

Parable of the Marriage Feast and the Slighted Invitation (Matthew<strong> 22</strong>:2-14; Luke

<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:16-24)

Jesus had the bride, not John because the latter was not the Messiah (John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:29).

John called himself a friend of the Bridegroom/Jesus (John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:29) to indicate his

secondary position and his joy at seeing the other person’s importance.


*Weeping and gnashing of teeth


As a standard phrase it stands for (extreme) suffering (Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:51; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:12; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:42, 50;

<strong><sup>22</sup></strong>:13; <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>:30; Luke <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:28).


Wheat


Sifting someone like wheat means putting him through hard experiences (Luke<strong> 22</strong>:31;

Amos<strong> 9</strong>:9; Isaiah <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>:28).


Widow of Zarephath/Sarepta


In Luke <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:26 Jesus uses the help Elijah gave to this widow during the 3½ years of drought as a picture of God’s concern for non-Jews. (See also “Jonah,” “Solomon,” “Naaman.”).


*Wind


Represents the trials and tests of life (Matthew <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:25, 27; cp. James<strong> 3</strong>:4?)

Represents the Spirit (John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>)

Winds blowing in different directions represent contrary influences on people that

confuse them (Ephesians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:14).

Wind on the threshing floor is used to blow the chaff—profitless, unstable material—

out of the seed.

“The four winds” refers to “all directions” (Matthew <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:31 = Mark<strong> 13</strong>:27; Revelation

<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:1; Daniel<strong> 7</strong>:2; Zechariah <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:6).


Wine


A person that has old wine does not want to go to new, which is comparable to observing that a person who experiences the better does not want to go back to the lesser (Luke<strong> 5</strong>:39).



Wineskins


You do not put new wine into old wineskins as compared to trying to put certain contents into containers unnatural to hold those contents (Matthew <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:12 = Mark <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:22 = Luke <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>:37-38).


Compare re-creation, born-again <em>vs.</em> circumcision.


(Winnowing; see “Sowing-Reaping/Harvesting-Seed.”)


Womb


Opening the womb means being the firstborn (Luke<strong> 2</strong>:23).

Source


Word


Christ is called the word of God because he declared him (John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:18; John <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:1, 14).


World


The material realm in contrast to heaven

The typical evil society of people (John <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:18-19; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>:8)

Political/material

The (a) world has people as its content, and (b) people are generally evil; hence, the

connection between the creation and evil.


Yeast (See “Leaven.”)


*Yoke


Fellow workers are yoke fellows (Philippians <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>:3).

Christians should not yoke themselves together with unbelievers (2 Corinthians <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>:14).

Accepting Christ’s way of living is like taking an easy yoke on yourself (Matthew

<strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:29-30).



Putting circumcision and obedience to the law of Moses on Gentiles is like putting too

big a yoke on them that they cannot handle (Acts <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>:10; Galatians<strong> 5</strong>:1).

Being a slave is like being under a yoke (1Timothy<strong> 6</strong>:1).




<strong>Part II: The Ideas Represented by Images</strong>


<strong>Agency</strong>


The arm of God

The finger of God (Luke <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:20; Exodus <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:19)

The hand of God

Invisible agency like what causes the wind to blow (John <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:8)


<strong>Abrogating the law</strong>


Nailing it to the cross

Tearing down the temple and rebuilding a temple in its place

Dying to get out from under Mosaism (death-resurrection)


<strong>Animal imagery</strong>


Dove: harmlessness

Fox: slyness (Luke <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:32)

Lion: strength, destruction

Scorpion: surprising harm/pain

Sheep: dependency

Snakes/vipers/dragon/reptiles: wisdom, deception, repulsiveness

Wolf

b.	Correlation between kind of cause and kind of effect

Grapes do not come from thorns.

Figs do not come from thistles.

Flesh is what comes from flesh.

Spirit is what comes from spirit.


c.	Small cause for large result

*Bridle/bit (James<strong> 3</strong>:3)

Rudder of a ship (James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:3)

Spark of fire (James <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>:6)

Mustard seed relative to the plant that comes from it



d.	Inescapable consequences


A millstone tied around the neck and the person thrown into the ocean (Matthew

<strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:6; Mark <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:2; Luke <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>:2)

Heading toward the pangs of childbirth

A stone falling on someone and grinding him to dust (Matthew <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>:44)


<strong>Apostasy </strong>(returning to something previously left)


A washed sow returning to the mud hole (Proverbs <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:11; 2 Peter<strong> 2</strong>:22)

A dog eating his own vomit (Proverbs <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:11; 2 Peter <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>:22)
