title: ETHICS AND THE GOLDEN RULE
weight: 35
---



Treating other people the way we want to be treated implies the fundamental continuity of humankind. Variations between people do exist, but they do not normally deal with matters that impinge on ethical considerations. Supposing the continuity of human nature as the background for the Golden Rule is preferable to supposing that the Golden Rule describes a non-content procedure, the approach of R. M. McIver, “The Deep Beauty of the Golden Rule” in <em>Philosophy and Contemporary Issues</em>, pp. 233-39.

The principle touches on the reason for doing good in return for evil because that circumstance necessarily arises if we are ever to break the downward spiral of deteriorating relationships. It also touches on the reason they are often bad: they do not know experientially a more excellent way. They will not experience a preferable way of acting unless we do not return their evil in kind. Living ethically calls for experiencing a better behavior to know that it is good because it brings a more fulfilling life.
