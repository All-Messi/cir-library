ORIGIN OF THE ROMAN CHURCH(ES)

At least three household churches existed in Rome by the time Paul wrote to the

imperial city: Romans 16:5, 14, 15.

Early churches outside Palestine had varying proportions of the following groups:

Jews, proselytes, God-fearers (σεβόμενοι, sebomenoi), Gentiles/Greeks.

I. Converts from Pentecost: Acts 2:10

II. Jews returning after the relaxation of Claudius’ edict of expulsion in A.D. 49

(Claudius died in A.D. 54): Romans 16:3-5a and Acts 18:2

III. Migration of converts from other Gentile areas: Epaenetus (Romans 16:5a); Urbanus (Romans 16:9a); Rufus (Romans 16:13). Especially would this be the case among Jewish converts; Hellenistic Jews were largely involved in commerce and located in inland cities along the trade routes as well as in coastal cities at the terminals of sea lanes. (This entry may overlap with II.)

IV. Interchurch activity: Phoebe (Romans 16:1-4); Aquila and Prisca (Romans 16:3-5a;

Acts 18:2-4, 24-28; 1 Corinthians 16:9)

V. Apostolic input

A.	Peter did not found the Roman church(es).

1.   Peter was still in Jerusalem in A.D. 49 (Acts 15), as far as New Testament

records go.

2.   Paul made a practice of not building on another’s foundation (Romans

15:20).

B.	Paul did not found the church: 1:6-15; 11:13; 15:20, 24, 28; cp. Acts 19:21;

23:11.
