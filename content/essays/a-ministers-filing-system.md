title: A MINISTER’S FILING SYSTEM
weight: 999
---




You will not remember! That is the bottom line when it comes to libraries and filing systems. The efficiency with which a minister discharges his responsibilities is directly proportionate to the degree of ready access he has to his materials. The quality of his work is determined by the extent to which he can organize and preserve the information that he generates and that comes to him from a wide range of sources. A person needs to organize his files because he will remember only a small percent of what he learns and needs to know.

Information comes in different forms; consequently, you need to have a corresponding variety of forms for keeping track of it. (a) There are 3 x 5 cards for ideas that come to mind, bibliography, or short notes you take out of larger items you do not own or do not want to keep as a whole. (b) Books can be organized by areas and sub-topics on bookshelves. It is probably satisfactory to keep just a 3 x 5 author card for each book. In addition you need (c) folders in a filing system. In folders you can place articles from serials, newspaper clippings, class notes, sermons you preach, lessons you teach, even 3 x 5 cards on topics that do not require a whole separate card box. Stacking articles on the corner of a desk or jotting down little things on the back of envelops is literally “useless” because they will not likely be used. A deficient filing system means that you will use only the information that is available in the books you happen to own, because books have titles, tables of content, and indices. Your library, 3 x 5 card system, and filing system can all follow the same topical breakdown, although they may vary in the degree of their specificness in different places.

Be sure to have materials on hand for preserving information: folders, 3 x 5 cards, card boxes, paper, and filing cabinets. If you do not have them readily available, you will either toss what should be kept or put it somewhere it does not naturally belong. For the same reason it is really best to go ahead and create files for topics you are certain to use. Otherwise in haste you will find yourself putting articles into folders that are too general or somewhat aside from the subject of this essay. As a result you will not remember where you put it, and it will get lost altogether or it will take more trouble to find it than it is worth. What you put away must be retrievable or a filing system becomes a systematic way of losing things.

There are several minister’s filing systems on the market. Many of them are too complicated for practical purposes unless a person has a very capable secretary to keep them up to date. This problem applies particularly to something like Memory-O-Matic. You want to have a system that requires little recopying of information as possible.

There are two important guidelines for filing a system: (1) it must be expandable, and (2) it must be simple enough to remember. In the beginning your folders can be more general. For example, you may simply have a folder called “Salvation.” Before long, however, that folder will become too thick. At that point you can sub-divide it into smaller categories: atonement, faith and works, perseverance, predestination,<em> etc</em>., depending on how the collection is growing. Keep the general folder for articles that make a broad sweep through several of these topics. An expandable approach allows you filing system to grow according to the emphasis of your ministry, something not predictable ahead of time. You do not have to begin with a folder for every conceivable sub-heading under the subjects you use. An expandable approach also allows you filing system to handle different degrees of specificness within topics. General folders (“Salvation”) can be placed ahead of the more detailed ones that are related to them.


The following scheme falls into five groupings: (1) biblical, which includes critical introduction and a format that follows the layout of biblical books; (2) theological, which covers doctrine topically; (3) practical, which covers Christian living; (4) ministerial, which deals with Christian service, and (5) general, which picks up several sets of topics not included under the other four.

In addition to the categories offered here, you may find it helpful to consult a resource like Paul Gericke<em>, </em><em><u>The Minister’s Filing System</u></em> (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, 1978).



I. BIBLICAL STUDIES


A. Introduction


1. Critical Introduction to the Bible


A. Critical Introduction to the Old Testament (if this section grows large enough, you may have a folder for each book)

The breakdown here may begin with a folder per book. Later as need arises, there may be a folder for each chapter of some books. A similar system could be set up in notebooks, but bookshelves are not wide enough or deep enough to store them neatly. If need be, there may be one page per verse within each chapter’s folder.
