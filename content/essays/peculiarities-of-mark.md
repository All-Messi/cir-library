PECULIARITIES OF MARK

1.  	Most characterized by the expression εὐθύς (euthys, “immediately”: 42 times vs. 4 times in Matthew and once in Luke). Does καὶ εὐθύς [kai euthys] amount to “and by and by,” “and at another time”?

2. 	Most pronounced emphasis on deeds of Jesus and the least teaching material (λογία, logia)

3.   Most characteristically uses the historic present

4.  	Most characteristically uses the ingressive imperfect tense

5.  	Shortest gospel (but has some individual blocks that are longer than the corresponding treatments in the other synoptics)

6.  	Stress on the “Messianic secret”

Contains a few Latinisms

8.	Explains Aramaic terms and uses them
