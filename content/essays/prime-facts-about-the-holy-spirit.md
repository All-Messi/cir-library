PRIME FACTS ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT

1.  The Spirit is a person, not a force, idea, emotional surge.

2.  The Spirit is deity: Psalm 138:7-10; Matthew 28:19; Acts 5:3 (+ 4/9?); 1 Corinthians 2:10-

11; 12:4-6; 13:14; 2 Corinthians 1:21-22; Ephesians 4:4-6; Hebrews 9:14.

3.  The Spirit “proceeds” from the Father and the Son: John 14:16.

4.  There is a difference between the Spirit (personal) and manifestations of the Spirit:

miraculous manifestation via direct descent, laying on of hands, and answered prayer;

characteristic positive interpersonal behavior: John 13:35; 1 Corinthians 13.

5.  The Spirit is not perceivable in himself without being manifested: Judges 16:20.

6.  We know we have the Spirit on the basis of promise, not perception; not feeling (see above),

miraculous gifts, frenzy, altered states of consciousness, ecstasy.

7.  What the Spirit gives a person will not contradict what Christ has taught: John 16:15;

Deuteronomy 13:1-5.

8.  Rule of Usage: If we cannot tell the difference between our experience from other people’s

experiences, we do not claim our idea or plan of action is from the Spirit; and we do not bank on it ourselves. To the extent that God’s will is specific, his leading will be explicit.

9.  Miraculous manifestation is not as important as interpersonal behavior: 1 Corinthians 12:30.

Miracle is in the service of prophecy: 1 Corinthians 14:5.

10. The Spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet: 1 Corinthians 14:32.
