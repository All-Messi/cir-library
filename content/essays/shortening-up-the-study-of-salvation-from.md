SHORTENING UP THE STUDY OF SALVATION FROM

What the Bible Says About Salvation

Since What the Bible Says About Salvation is rather long, using it in a church setting requires reducing it somewhat. There are two ways to reduce the amount of material and get at it more efficiently. First, use only the positive presentations (instead of looking at the alternative beliefs together with the reasons for and against them). Second, use the booklet Questions and Answers on “What the Bible Says About Salvation” on just the chapters (or parts of chapters chosen from the text itself).

Chapter 1: “The Nature of Salvation” (particularly pages 5-10)

Chapter 3: “The Nature of Sin” (particularly pages 18-23)

Chapter 4: “The Sinfulness of Man”*

Chapter 5: “The Impossibility of Self-Salvation”*

Chapter 7: “Benefits of the Atonement”

Chapter 8: “Limited Universalism”

Chapter 9: “Justification by Faith: Conditionality”*

Chapter 16: “The Meaning of Christian Baptism”*

(Chapter 19: “The Candidate for Baptism,” particularly pages 284-89)

(Chapter 20: “The Form of Baptism: Immersion”)

(Chapter 25: “The Importance of Baptism”)

Chapter 26: “The Assurance of Salvation”

In the list above are nine chapters chosen from among the full twenty-six that are in the book. Three more possibilities appear in parentheses. Four chapters are asterisked as possibilities for receiving more than one week's attention.
