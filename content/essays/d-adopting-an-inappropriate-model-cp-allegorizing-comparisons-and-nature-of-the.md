D.	Adopting an inappropriate model (cp. allegorizing comparisons and nature of the

case)			                     Virgil Warre, PhD

Adopting an inappropriate model appears in cases that deal with analogical reasoning. It is a confusion that comes into discussions when people try to use illustrations. When the model is off, inferences made from it can be foreign to the topic at hand because the model has elements in it that are not in the thing it is called on to explain..

**The problem of pain. Note the error in conceiving of suffering as exactly like disciplining a child (Proverbs 3:11 < Hebrews 12:5-13).

**The trinity (as tritheism)

**The interpretation procedure itself. Interpreters suppose that their task is putting together individual points that automatically add up to a full picture. Instead, interpretation procedure is “biblical-systematic”; there is reciprocation between specific verses that teach general truths and general truths that in turn clarify other specific passages that contribute to other general truths, and so on.

**Church organization. Some kinds of things can be added to without altering what is already there. In church organization, it depends on where additions are made as to whether they controvert any New Testament pattern. Delegation of responsibilities can also take place without conflicting with organizational structure.

**Certain arguments against instrumental music. If God tells you to ride a bicycle to the store and you walk, you have disobeyed God. If God tells you to sing and you play an instrument, you have disobeyed God. The trouble with the illustration is that riding a bicycle and walking are mutually exclusive possibilities on a given occasion, but across a series of experiences singing and playing an instrument are not mutually exclusive. This argument illustrates the problem of putting compatible things in opposition with each other (opposing compatibles).
