A.D.	34 (perhaps 37)	Accession of Aretas	Paul’s   conversion   had   to   follow   this 				date (Gal. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>:17-18; 2 Cor. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>:32).


36	Pontius Pilate deposed	Does   the   absence   of   a   procurator   in 				Palestine  account  for  the  possibility  of				executing      Stephen     and     of     Paul’s 				putting   others   to  death?   (Acts  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>:1-<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>:3; 				<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>:1-2; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>:9-11)

40	Death of Aretas


44	Death of Herod Agrippa I	Paul’s  first   missionary   journey   had   to 				follow  this  date. (Acts <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>:20-23 recounts				his death + <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>:1-<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>:28 records the tour.)

May 51-May 52	Gallio’s proconsulship in 	Paul’s   first   time   in   Corinth  coincided 		  	  Corinth 	with his proconsulship (Acts <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>:12-17).


53  	Earliest date for the mar-	Paul’s appearance before Felix just before 		  	  riage of Felix to Drusilla	the  accession  of  Festus  could  not  have 				preceded A.D. 53 (Acts <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:24-27).


Oct.  13,  54	Death of Claudius	The return of Jews to Rome had to precede 				the writing of Romans.


60	Destruction of Laodecia  	The  latest  time  for  the  writing of Paul’s 		   	  and Colossae by an 	letter to Colossae from the first year of the 		  	  earthquake 	first Roman imprisonment (?)


62	Death of Festus	Paul’s  appearance  before  him  had to be 				before this date (Acts <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>:24-27).
